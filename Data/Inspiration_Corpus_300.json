[["Rigid tightly packed amino acid crystals as functional supramolecular materials", "The formation of ordered nanostructures by metabolites is gaining increased interest due to the simplicity of the building blocks and their natural occurrence. Specifically, aromatic amino acids possess the ability to form ordered supramolecular interactions due to their limited solubility in aqueous solution. Unexpectedly, l-tyrosine (l-Tyr) is almost 2 orders of magnitude less soluble in water compared to l-phenylalanine (l-Phe). However, the underlying mechanism is not fully understood as l-Tyr is more polar. Here, we explore the utilization of insoluble tyrosine assemblies for technological applications and their molecular basis by manipulating the basic building blocks of tightly packed dimers. We show that the addition of an amyloid inhibition agent increases l-Tyr solubility due to the disruption of the dimer formation. The molecular organization grants the l-Tyr crystal higher thermal stability and mechanical properties between three amino acids. Additionally, l-Tyr crystals are shown to generate high and stable piezoelectric power outputs under mechanical pressure in a sandwich device. By incorporating the rigid l-Tyr crystals into a soft polymer, a mechano-responsive bending composite was fabricated. Furthermore, the l-Tyr crystalline needles exhibit an active photowaveguiding property, making them promising candidates for the generation of photonic biomaterial-based devices. The present work exemplifies a feasible strategy to explore physical properties of supramolecular self-assemblies comprises minimalistic naturally occurring building blocks and their applications in energy harvesting, photonic devices, stretchable electronics, and soft robotics."], ["The role of proton coupled electron transfer in water oxidation", "Water oxidation is a key half reaction in energy conversion schemes based on solar fuels and targets such as light driven water splitting or carbon dioxide reduction into CO, other oxygenates, or hydrocarbons. Carrying out these reactions at rates that exceed the rate of solar insolation for the extended periods of time required for useful applications presents a major challenge. Water oxidation is the key \u201cother\u201d half reaction in these schemes and it is dominated by PCET given its multi-electron, multi-proton character, 2H2O \u2192 O2 + 4e\u2212 + 4H+. Identification of PCET was an offshoot of experiments designed to investigate energy conversion by electron transfer quenching of molecular excited states. The concepts \u201credox potential leveling\u201d and concerted electron\u2013proton transfer came from measurements on stepwise oxidation of cis-RuII(bpy)2(py)(OH2)2+ to RuIV(bpy)2(py)(O)2+. The Ru \u201cblue dimer\u201d, cis,cis-(bpy)2(H2O)RuORu(OH2)(bpy)24+, was the first designed catalyst for water oxidation. It undergoes oxidative activation by PCET to give the transient (bpy)2(O)RuVORuV(O)(bpy)24+, O-atom attack on water to give a peroxidic intermediate, and further oxidation and O2 release. More recently, a class of single site water oxidation catalysts has been identified, e.g., Ru(tpy)(bpm)(OH2)2+ (tpy is 2,2\u2032:6\u2032,2\u2032\u2032-terpyridine; bpm is 2,2\u2032-bipyrimidine). They undergo stepwise PCET oxidation to RuIV=O2+ or RuV(O)3+ followed by O-atom transfer with formation of peroxidic intermediates which undergo further oxidation and O2 release. PCET plays a key role in the three zones of water oxidation reactivity: oxidative activation, O\u22efO bond formation, oxidation and O2 release from peroxidic intermediates. Similar schemes have been identified for electrocatalytic water oxidation on oxide electrode surfaces based on phosphonated derivatives such as [Ru(Mebimpy)(4,4\u2032-(PO3H2CH2)2bpy)(OH2)]2+. A PCET barrier to RuIII\u2013OH2+ \u2192 RuIV=O2+ oxidation arises from the large difference in pKa values between RuIII\u2013OH2+ and RuIV(OH)3+. On oxide surfaces this oxidation occurs by multiple pathways. Kinetic, mechanistic, and DFT results on single site catalysts reveal a new pathway for the O\u22efO bond forming step (Atom-Proton Transfer, APT), significant rate enhancements by added proton acceptor bases, and accelerated water oxidation in propylene carbonate as solvent with water added as a stoichiometric reagent. Lessons learned about water oxidation and the role of PCET and concerted pathways appear to have direct relevance for water oxidation in Photosystem II (PSII) with PSII a spectacular example of PCET in action. This includes a key role for Multiple Site-Electron Proton Transfer in oxidative activation of the Oxygen Evolving Complex (OEC) in the S0 \u2192 S1 transition in the Kok cycle."], ["Renewable and recyclable covalent adaptable networks based on bio-derived lipoic acid", "The modern materials economy is inefficient since most products are principally derived from non-renewable feedstocks and largely single-use in nature. Conventional thermoset materials are often inherently unreprocessable due to their irreversible covalent crosslinks and hence are challenging to recycle and/or reprocess. Covalent adaptable networks (CAN)s, which incorporate reversible or dynamic covalent bonding, have emerged as an efficient means to afford reprocessable crosslinked materials and increasing the feedstock sustainability of CANs is a developing aim. In this study, the biomass-derived lipoic acid, which possesses a dynamic cyclic disulfide moiety, was transformed into a series of bifunctional monomers via a one-step esterification or amidation reaction and reacted with a commercially available multi-valent thiol in the presence of an organobase catalyst to afford dynamically crosslinked networks. Large differences in material properties, such as storage modulus and glass transition temperature, were observed when the ratio of the lipoic acid-based monomer to thiol (from 1\u2006:\u20061 to 16\u2006:\u20061) and the composition of the monomer were changed to modify the network architecture. The thermomechanical properties of an optimised formulation were investigated more thoroughly to reveal a moderately strong rubber (ultimate tensile strength = 1.8 \u00b1 0.4 MPa) possessing a large rubbery plateau (from 0 to 150 \u00b0C) which provides an adaptable material with a wide operational temperature range. Finally, the chemical recycling, or depolymerisation, of the optimised network was also demonstrated by simply solvating the material in the presence of an organobase catalyst."], ["Creating an Eco-Friendly Building Coating with Smart Subambient Radiative Cooling", "Subambient daytime radiative cooling (SDRC) provides a promising electricity- and cryogen-free pathway for global energy-efficiency. However, current SDRC systems require stringent surface designs, which are neither cost-effective nor eco-friendly, to selectively emit thermal radiation to outer space and simultaneously maximize solar reflectance. Here, a generic method is developed to upgrade the conventional building-coating materials with a peculiar self-adaptive SDRC effect through combining particle scattering, sunlight-excited fluorescence, and mid-infrared broadband radiation. It is also theoretically proved that heat exchange with the sky can eliminate the use of resonant microstructures and noble metal mirrors in conventional SDRC, and also leads to enhanced daytime cooling yet suppressed nighttime overcooling. When exposed to direct sunlight, the upgraded coating over an aluminum plate can achieve 6 \u00b0C (7 \u00b0C on a scale-model building) below the ambient temperature under a solar intensity of 744 W m-2 (850 W m-2 ), yielding a cooling power of 84.2 W m-2 .

Although many editing sites have recently been discovered(2-7), the extent to which most sites are edited and how the editing is regulated in different biological contexts are not fully understood(8-10). Here we report dynamic spatiotemporal patterns and new regulators of RNA editing, discovered through an extensive profiling of A-to-I RNA editing in 8,551 human samples (representing 53 body sites from 552 individuals) from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and in hundreds of other primate and mouse samples. We show that editing levels in non-repetitive coding regions vary more between tissues than editing levels in repetitive regions. Globally, ADAR1 is the primary editor of repetitive sites and ADAR2 is the primary editor of non repetitive coding sites, whereas the catalytically inactive ADAR3 predominantly acts as an inhibitor of editing. Cross-species analysis of RNA editing in several tissues revealed that species, rather than tissue type, is the primary determinant of editing levels, suggesting stronger cis-directed regulation of RNA editing for most sites, although the small set of conserved coding sites is under stronger trans-regulation. In addition, we curated an extensive set of ADAR1 and ADAR2 targets and showed that many editing sites display distinct tissue-specific regulation by the ADAR enzymes in vivo. Further analysis of the GTEx data revealed several potential regulators of editing, such as AIMP2, which reduces editing in muscles by enhancing the degradation of the ADAR proteins.

Superconductivity in the newly discovered rare- earth iron- based oxide systems ROFeAs ( R, rare- earth metal) also arises from either electron(3-7) or hole(8) doping of their non- superconducting parent compounds. The parent material LaOFeAs is metallic but shows anomalies near 150 K in both resistivity and d. c. magnetic susceptibility(3). Although optical conductivity and theoretical calculations suggest that LaOFeAs exhibits a spin- density- wave ( SDW) instability that is suppressed by doping with electrons to induce superconductivity(9), there has been no direct evidence of SDW order. Here we report neutron- scattering experiments that demonstrate that LaOFeAs undergoes an abrupt structural distortion below 155 K, changing the symmetry from tetragonal ( space group P4/ nmm) to monoclinic ( space group P112/ n) at low temperatures, and then, at similar to 137 K, develops long- range SDW- type antiferromagnetic order with a small moment but simple magnetic structure(9). Doping the system with fluorine suppresses both the magnetic order and the structural distortion in favour of superconductivity. Therefore, like high- T(c) copper oxides, the superconducting regime in these iron- based materials occurs in close proximity to a long- range- ordered antiferromagnetic ground state."], ["Electrolytic deuteration of unsaturated bonds without using D2", "Site-selective deuteration of C\u2013H bonds increases the lifetime and efficacy of drug molecules.

Here we report cost-efficient and site-selective reductive deuteration using a tandem electrochemical chemical palladium membrane reactor. This architecture mediates the chemical reaction of deuterium atoms (derived from reusable D2O in an electrochemical compartment) with alkynes, aldehydes and imines. The formation of C(sp3)\u2013D and C(sp2)\u2013D bonds in the isolated chemical compartment is made possible by the deuterium-selective permeability of the membrane that partitions the electrochemical compartment from the chemical compartment.

The isosteric substitution of hydrogen by an electronegative fluorine atom has been proposed as a useful route to improve the photovoltaic performance of 2D OIPs, whereas its valuable role in developing ferroelectricity is still waiting for further exploration. Herein, for the first time we applied fluorinated aromatic cations in extending the family of 2D OIP ferroelectrics, and successfully obtained [2-fluorobenzylammonium]2PbCl4 as a high-performance ferroelectric semiconductor. The failures in the nonferroelectric [4-fluorobenzylammonium]2PbCl4 and [3-fluorobenzylammonium]2PbCl4 demonstrate that the selective introduction of fluorine in correct structural positions is particularly essential.

For example, mini-Dirac points, tunable Mott insulator states and the Hofstadter butterfly pattern can emerge in different types of graphene/boron nitride moire superlattices, whereas correlated insulating states and superconductivity have been reported in twisted bilayer graphene moire superlattices(1-12). In addition to their pronounced effects on single-particle states, moire superlattices have recently been predicted to host excited states such as moire exciton bands(13-15). Here we report the observation of moire superlattice exciton states in tungsten diselenide/tungsten disulfide (WSe2/WS2) heterostructures in which the layers are closely aligned. These moire exciton states manifest as multiple emergent peaks around the original WSe2 A exciton resonance in the absorption spectra, and they exhibit gate dependences that are distinct from that of the A exciton in WSe2 monolayers and in WSe2/WS2 heterostructures with large twist angles. These phenomena can be described by a theoretical model in which the periodic moire potential is much stronger than the exciton kinetic energy and generates multiple flat exciton minibands. The moire exciton bands provide an attractive platform from which to explore and control excited states of matter, such as topological excitons and a correlated exciton Hubbard model, in transitionmetal dichalcogenides."], ["Widespread transmission of independent cancer lineages within multiple bivalve species", "Most cancers arise from oncogenic changes in the genomes of somatic cells, and while the cells may migrate by metastasis, they remain within that single individual. Natural transmission of cancer cells from one individual to another has been observed in two distinct cases in mammals (Tasmanian devils(1) and dogs(2,3)), but these are generally considered to be rare exceptions in nature. The discovery of transmissible cancer in soft-shell clams (Mya arenaria)(4) suggested that this phenomenon might be more widespread. Here we analyse disseminated neoplasia in mussels (Mytilus trossulus), cockles (Cerastoderma edule), and golden carpet shell clams (Polititapes aureus) and find that neoplasias in all three species are attributable to independent transmissible cancer lineages. In mussels and cockles, the cancer lineages are derived from their respective host species; however, unexpectedly, cancer cells in P. aureus are all derived from Venerupis corrugata, a different species living in the same geographical area. No cases of disseminated neoplasia have thus far been found in V. corrugata from the same region. These findings show that transmission of cancer cells in the marine environment is common in multiple species, that it has originated many times, and that while most transmissible cancers are found spreading within the species of origin, cross-species transmission of cancer cells can occur."], ["Highly stretchable and tough hydrogels", "Hydrogels are used as scaffolds for tissue engineering1, vehicles for drug delivery2, actuators for optics and fluidics3, and model extracellular matrices for biological studies4. The scope of hydrogel applications, however, is often severely limited by their mechanical behaviour5. Most hydrogels do not exhibit high stretchability; for example, an alginate hydrogel ruptures when stretched to about 1.2 times its original length. Some synthetic elastic hydrogels6,7 have achieved stretches in the range 10\u201320, but these values are markedly reduced in samples containing notches. Most hydrogels are brittle, with fracture energies of about 10\u2009J\u2009m\u22122 (ref. 8), as compared with \u223c1,000\u2009J\u2009m\u22122 for cartilage9 and \u223c10,000\u2009J\u2009m\u22122 for natural rubbers10.

Here we report the synthesis of hydrogels from polymers forming ionically and covalently crosslinked networks. Although such gels contain \u223c90% water, they can be stretched beyond 20 times their initial length, and have fracture energies of \u223c9,000\u2009J\u2009m\u22122. Even for samples containing notches, a stretch of 17 is demonstrated. We attribute the gels\u2019 toughness to the synergy of two mechanisms: crack bridging by the network of covalent crosslinks, and hysteresis by unzipping the network of ionic crosslinks. Furthermore, the network of covalent crosslinks preserves the memory of the initial state, so that much of the large deformation is removed on unloading. The unzipped ionic crosslinks cause internal damage, which heals by re-zipping. These gels may serve as model systems to explore mechanisms of deformation and energy dissipation, and expand the scope of hydrogel applications."], ["Synthesis of Sulfilimines Enabled by Copper-Catalyzed S-Arylation of Sulfenamides", "Herein, an unprecedented synthetic route to sulfilimines via a copper-catalyzed Chan\u2013Lam-type coupling of sulfenamides is presented. A key to success in this novel transformation is the chemoselective S-arylation of S(II) sulfenamides to form S(IV) sulfilimines, overriding the competitive, and more thermodynamically favored, C\u2013N bond formation that does not require a change in the sulfur oxidation state. Computations reveal that the selectivity arises from a selective transmetallation event where bidentate sulfenamide coordination through the sulfur and oxygen atoms favors the S-arylation pathway. The mild and environmentally benign catalytic conditions enable broad functional group compatibility, allowing a variety of diaryl or alkyl aryl sulfilimines to be efficiently prepared. The Chan\u2013Lam coupling procedure could also tolerate alkenylboronic acids as coupling partners to afford alkenyl aryl sulfilimines, a class of scaffolds that cannot be directly synthesized via conventional imination strategies. The benzoyl-protecting groups could be conveniently removed from the product, which, in turn, could be readily transformed into several S(IV) and S(VI) derivatives."], ["Infinite-layer iron oxide with a square-planar coordination", "Conventional high- temperature reactions limit the control of coordination polyhedra in transition- metal oxides to those obtainable within the bounds of known coordination geometries for a given transition metal(1). For example, iron atoms are almost exclusively coordinated by three- dimensional polyhedra such as tetrahedra and octahedra. However, recent works have shown that binary metal hydrides act as reducing agents at low temperatures, allowing access to unprecedented structures(2-4). Here we show the reaction of a perovskite SrFeO3 with CaH2 to yield SrFeO2, a new compound bearing a square- planar oxygen coordination around Fe2(+). SrFeO2 is isostructural with 'infinite layer' cupric oxides(5-8), and exhibits a magnetic order far above room temperature in spite of the two-dimensional structure, indicating strong in-layer magnetic interactions due to strong Fe d to O p hybridization. Surprisingly, SrFeO2 remains free from the structural instability that might well be expected at low temperatures owing to twofold orbital degeneracy in the Fe2+ ground state with D-4h point symmetry. The reduction and the oxidation between SrFeO2 and SrFeO3 proceed via the brownmillerite- type intermediate SrFeO2.5, and start at the relatively low temperature of similar to 400 K, making the material appealing for a variety of applications, including oxygen ion conduction, oxygen gas absorption and catalysis."], ["Single-crystal, large-area, fold-free monolayer graphene", "Chemical vapour deposition of carbon-containing precursors on metal substrates is currently the most promising route for the scalable synthesis of large-area, high-quality graphene films(1). However, there are usually some imperfections present in the resulting films: grain boundaries, regions with additional layers (adlayers), and wrinkles or folds, all of which can degrade the performance of graphene in various applications(2-7). There have been numerous studies on ways to eliminate grain boundaries(8,9) and adlayers(10-12), but graphene folds have been less investigated. Here we explore the wrinkling/folding process for graphene films grown from an ethylene precursor on single-crystal Cu-Ni(111) foils. We identify a critical growth temperature (1,030 kelvin) above which folds will naturally form during the subsequent cooling process. Specifically, the compressive stress that builds up owing to thermal contraction during cooling is released by the abrupt onset of step bunching in the foil at about 1,030 kelvin, triggering the formation of graphene folds perpendicular to the step edge direction. By restricting the initial growth temperature to between 1,000 kelvin and 1,030 kelvin, we can produce large areas of single-crystal monolayer graphene films that are high-quality and fold-free. The resulting films show highly uniform transport properties: field-effect transistors prepared from these films exhibit average room-temperature carrier mobilities of around (7.0 +/- 1.0) x 10(3) centimetres squared per volt per second for both holes and electrons. The process is also scalable, permitting simultaneous growth of graphene of the same quality on multiple foils stacked in parallel. After electrochemical transfer of the graphene films from the foils, the foils themselves can be reused essentially indefinitely for further graphene growth. Restricting the initial growth temperatures used for chemical vapour deposition of graphene on metal foils produces optimum conditions for growing large areas of fold-free, single-crystal graphene."], ["Carbon nanotubes as nanoscale mass conveyors", "The development of manipulation tools that are not too 'fat' or too 'sticky' for atomic scale assembly is an important challenge facing nanotechnology(1).

However, as fabrication tools, both scanning tunnelling and atomic force microscopes suffer from a loading deficiency: although they can manipulate atoms already present, they cannot efficiently deliver atoms to the work area. Carbon nanotubes, with their hollow cores and large aspect ratios, have been suggested(7,8) as possible conduits for nanoscale amounts of material. Already much effort has been devoted to the filling of nanotubes(8-11) and the application of such techniques(12,13). Furthermore, carbon nanotubes have been used as probes in scanning probe microscopy(14-16).

Dysregulation has been linked to neurodegeneration(3,4), cardiovascular disease(3) and cancer(5). Key components of the fission machinery include the endoplasmic reticulum(6) and actin(7), which initiate constriction before dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1)(8) binds to the outer mitochondrial membrane via adaptor proteins(9-11), to drive scission(12). In the mitochondrial life cycle, fission enables both biogenesis of new mitochondria and clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria through mitophagy(1,13). Current models of fission regulation cannot explain how those dual fates are decided. However, uncovering fate determinants is challenging, as fission is unpredictable, and mitochondrial morphology is heterogeneous, with ultrastructuralfeatures that are below the diffraction limit. Here, we used live-cell structured illumination microscopy to capture mitochondrial dynamics. By analysing hundreds of fissions in African green monkey Cos-7 cells and mouse cardiomyocytes, we discovered two functionally and mechanistically distinct types of fission. Division at the periphery enables damaged material to be shed into smaller mitochondria destined for mitophagy, whereas division at the midzone leads to the proliferation of mitochondria. Both types are mediated by DRP1, but endoplasmic reticulum- and actin-mediated pre-constriction and the adaptor MFF govern only midzone fission. Peripheral fission is preceded by lysosomal contact and is regulated by the mitochondrial outer membrane protein FIS1. These distinct molecular mechanisms explain how cells independently regulate fission, leading to distinct mitochondrial fates."], ["Skeletal editing through direct nitrogen deletion of secondary amines", "Nitrogen is 'deleted' from secondary amines using anomeric amide reagents, which react with the amine to form an isodiazene, after which nitrogen gas is released and the resulting carbon radicals combine to form a carbon-carbon bond. Synthetic chemistry aims to build up molecular complexity from simple feedstocks(1). However, the ability to exert precise changes that manipulate the connectivity of the molecular skeleton itself remains limited, despite possessing substantial potential to expand the accessible chemical space(2,3). Here we report a reaction that 'deletes' nitrogen from organic molecules. We show that N-pivaloyloxy-N-alkoxyamides, a subclass of anomeric amides, promote the intermolecular activation of secondary aliphatic amines to yield intramolecular carbon-carbon coupling products. Mechanistic experiments indicate that the reactions proceed via isodiazene intermediates that extrude the nitrogen atom as dinitrogen, producing short-lived diradicals that rapidly couple to form the new carbon-carbon bond. The reaction shows broad functional-group tolerance, which enables the translation of routine amine synthesis protocols into a strategy for carbon-carbon bond constructions and ring syntheses. This is highlighted by the use of this reaction in the syntheses and skeletal editing of bioactive compounds."], ["Endothelial cell expression of haemoglobin \u03b1 regulates nitric oxide signalling", "Models of unregulated nitric oxide (NO) diffusion do not consistently account for the biochemistry of NO synthase (NOS)-dependent signalling in many cell systems(1-3). For example, endothelial NOS controls blood pressure, blood flow and oxygen delivery through its effect on vascular smooth muscle tone(4), but the regulation of these processes is not adequately explained by simple NO diffusion from endothelium to smooth muscle(3,5). Here we report a new model for the regulation of NO signalling by demonstrating that haemoglobin (Hb) alpha (encoded by the HBA1 and HBA2 genes in humans) is expressed in human and mouse arterial endothelial cells and enriched at the myoendothelial junction, where it regulates the effects of NO on vascular reactivity. Notably, this function is unique to Hb alpha and is abrogated by its genetic depletion. Mechanistically, endothelial Hb alpha haem iron in the Fe3+ state permits NO signalling, and this signalling is shut off when Hb alpha is reduced to the Fe2+ state by endothelial cytochrome b5 reductase 3 (CYB5R3, also known as diaphorase 1)(6). Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of CYB5R3 increases NO bioactivity in small arteries. These data reveal a new mechanism by which the regulation of the intracellular Hb alpha oxidation state controls NOS signalling in non-erythroid cells. This model may be relevant to haem-containing globins in a broad range of NOS-containing somatic cells(7-13)."], ["Distinct features of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 chromatin domains in pre-implantation embryos", "Histone modifications have critical roles in regulating the expression of developmental genes during embryo development in mammals(1,2). However, genome-wide analyses of histone modifications in pre-implantation embryos have been impeded by the scarcity of the required materials. Here, by using a small-scale chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) method(3), we map the genome-wide profiles of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), which are associated with gene activation and repression4,5, respectively, in mouse pre-implantation embryos. We find that the re-establishment of H3K4me3, especially on promoter regions, occurs much more rapidly than that of H3K27me3 following fertilization, which is consistent with the major wave of zygotic genome activation at the two-cell stage. Furthermore, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 possess distinct features of sequence preference and dynamics in preimplantation embryos. Although H3K4me3 modifications occur consistently at transcription start sites, the breadth of the H3K4me3 domain is a highly dynamic feature. Notably, the broad H3K4me3 domain (wider than 5 kb) is associated with higher transcription activity and cell identity not only in pre-implantation development but also in the process of deriving embryonic stem cells from the inner cell mass and trophoblast stem cells from the trophectoderm. Compared to embryonic stem cells, we found that the bivalency (that is, co-occurrence of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) in early embryos is relatively infrequent and unstable. Taken together, our results provide a genome-wide map of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 modifications in pre-implantation embryos, facilitating further exploration of the mechanism for epigenetic regulation in early embryos."], ["Digital Protocol for Chemical Analysis at Ultralow Concentrations by Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering", "Single molecule surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SM-SERS) has the potential to revolutionize quantitative analysis at ultralow concentrations (less than 1 nM). However, there are no established protocols to generalize the application of this technique in analytical chemistry. Here, a protocol for quantification at ultralow concentrations using SM-SERS is proposed. The approach aims to take advantage of the stochastic nature of the single-molecule regime to achieved lower limits of quantification (LOQ). Two emerging contaminants commonly found in aquatic environments, enrofloxacin (ENRO) and ciprofloxacin (CIPRO), were chosen as nonresonant molecular probes. The methodology involves a multivariate resolution curve fitting known as non-negative matrix factorization with alternating least-squares algorithm (NMF-ALS) to solve spectral overlaps. The key element of the quantification is to realize that, under SM-SERS conditions, the Raman intensity generated by a molecule adsorbed on a \u201chotspot\u201d can be digitalized. Therefore, the number of SERS event counts (rather than SERS intensities) was shown to be proportional to the solution concentration. This allowed the determination of both ENRO and CIPRO with high accuracy and precision even at ultralow concentrations regime. The LOQ for both ENRO and CIPRO were achieved at 2.8 pM. The digital SERS protocol, suggested here, is a roadmap for the implementation of SM-SERS as a routine tool for quantification at ultralow concentrations."], ["Direct observation of ultrafast hydrogen bond strengthening in liquid water", "Water is one of the most important, yet least understood, liquids in nature. Many anomalous properties of liquid water originate from its well-connected hydrogen bond network, including unusually efficient vibrational energy redistribution and relaxation. An accurate description of the ultrafast vibrational motion of water molecules is essential for understanding the nature of hydrogen bonds and many solution-phase chemical reactions. Most existing knowledge of vibrational relaxation in water is built upon ultrafast spectroscopy experiments. However, these experiments cannot directly resolve the motion of the atomic positions and require difficult translation of spectral dynamics into hydrogen bond dynamics. Here, we measure the ultrafast structural response to the excitation of the OH stretching vibration in liquid water with femtosecond temporal and atomic spatial resolution using liquid ultrafast electron scattering. We observed a transient hydrogen bond contraction of roughly 0.04\u2009\u00c5 on a timescale of 80 femtoseconds, followed by a thermalization on a timescale of approximately 1 picosecond. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal the need to treat the distribution of the shared proton in the hydrogen bond quantum mechanically to capture the structural dynamics on femtosecond timescales. Our experiment and simulations unveil the intermolecular character of the water vibration preceding the relaxation of the OH stretch."], ["DFT calculations bring insight to internal alkyne-to-vinylidene transformations at rhodium PNP- and PONOP-pincer complexes", "Density Functional Theory (DFT) has been used to investigate the alkyne-to-vinylidene isomerisation reaction mediated by [Rh(PXNXP)]+ complexes (X = CH2: 2,6-bis(di-tert-butylphosphinomethyl)pyridine (PNP) and X = O: 2,6-bis(di-tert-butylphosphinito)pyridine (PONOP)) for terminal alkynes HC[triple bond, length as m-dash]CR, where R = tBu and Ar\u2032 (3,5-tBu2C6H3). Calculations suggest the reaction mechanism proceeds via the slippage of \u03c0-bound alkyne at the Rh centre into a Rh\u2013alkyne \u03c3C\u2013H complex followed by an indirect 1,2-H shift to give the Rh\u2013vinylidene species. NBO (Natural Bond Orbital) analysis of the transition states corresponding to the latter indirect 1,2-H shift step indicates that the migrating hydrogen atom exhibits protic character and hence, the basicity of the H-accepting centre (C\u03b2) is controlled by the substituents at that same atom and can tune the 1,2-H shift transition state. QTAIM (Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecule) and NBO analyses of the Rh\u2013vinylidene complexes indicate that these species exhibit a Rh \u2190 C dative bond as well as \u03c0-back bonding from the Rh centre into the empty pz orbital of the carbene centre (C\u03b1), showing the Rh\u2013vinylidene complexes are Fischer type carbenes. Analysis of the alkyne and vinylidene complex HOMOs show that the equilibrium between the isomers can be tuned by the P\u2013Rh\u2013P bite angle of the [Rh(pincer)]+ fragment. Dictated by the nature of the pincer backbone, wider bite angles shift the equilibrium toward the formation of the Rh\u2013vinylidene isomer (e.g., X = CH2 and R = Ar\u2032), while tighter bite angles shift the equilibrium more to the formation of the Rh\u2013alkyne isomer (e.g., X = O and R = Ar\u2032)."], ["Beyond Hofmeister", "Research efforts related to the Hofmeister series of salt ions have waxed and waned during its long and storied history.

The reactions proceed either partially or entirely under acidic conditions. After surveying twenty-two phosphorus ligands, high yields of products were obtained with aryl chlorides only when a bulky ligand, 2-(di-tert-butyl-phosphino)-1-phenyl-1H-pyrrole (cataCXium\u00aePtB) was used. In contrast, aryl bromides produced high yields of products in the absence of both added base and added ligand. In order to explore the Suzuki coupling process entirely under acidic conditions, a series of reactions were conducted in buffered acidic media using several model substrates. 4-Chlorobenzylamine, in the presence of cataCXium\u00aePtB, produced high yields of product at buffered pH 6.0; the yields dropped off precipitously at buffered pH 5.0 and lower. The fall-off in yield was attributed to the decomposition of the Pd\u2013ligand complex due to the protonation of the ligand in the more acidic aqueous media. In contrast, in the absence of an added ligand, 4-amino-2-chloropyridine produced quantitative yields at buffered pH 3.5 and 4.5 while 4-amino-2-bromopyridine produced quantitative yields in a series of buffered media ranging from pH 4.5 to 1.5. These substrates are only partially protonated in acidic media and can behave as active Pd ligands in the Suzuki catalytic cycle."], ["Patterning by controlled cracking", "Crack formation drives material failure and is often regarded as a process to be avoided(1-3). However, closer examination of cracking phenomena has revealed exquisitely intricate patterns such as spirals(4), oscillating(5,6,7) and branched(7) fracture paths and fractal geometries(8). Here we demonstrate the controlled initiation, propagation and termination of a variety of channelled crack patterns in a film/substrate system(9-11) comprising a silicon nitride thin film deposited on a silicon substrate using low-pressure chemical vapour deposition. Micro-notches etched into the silicon substrate concentrated stress for crack initiation, which occurred spontaneously during deposition of the silicon nitride layer. We reproducibly created three distinct crack morphologies-straight, oscillatory and orderly bifurcated (stitchlike)-through careful selection of processing conditions and parameters. We induced direction changes by changing the system parameters, and we terminated propagation at preformed multi-step crack stops. We believe that our patterning technique presents new opportunities in nanofabrication and offers a starting point for atomic-scale pattern formation(12), which would be difficult even with current state-of-the-art nanofabrication methodologies."], ["Co-deposition of hole-selective contact and absorber for improving the processability of perovskite solar cells", "Simplifying the manufacturing processes of renewable energy technologies is crucial to lowering the barriers to commercialization. In this context, to improve the manufacturability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), we have developed a one-step solution-coating procedure in which the hole-selective contact and perovskite light absorber spontaneously form, resulting in efficient inverted PSCs. We observed that phosphonic or carboxylic acids, incorporated into perovskite precursor solutions, self-assemble on the indium tin oxide substrate during perovskite film processing. They form a robust self-assembled monolayer as an excellent hole-selective contact while the perovskite crystallizes. Our approach solves wettability issues and simplifies device fabrication, advancing the manufacturability of PSCs. Our PSC devices with positive\u2013intrinsic\u2013negative (p-i-n) geometry show a power conversion efficiency of 24.5% and retain >90% of their initial efficiency after 1,200\u2009h of operating at the maximum power point under continuous illumination.

The development of insect resistance to Bt toxins endangers their long-term effectiveness. Here we have developed a phage-assisted continuous evolution selection that rapidly evolves high-affinity protein-protein interactions, and applied this system to evolve variants of the Bt toxin Cry1Ac that bind a cadherin-like receptor from the insect pest Trichoplusia ni (TnCAD) that is not natively bound by wild-type Cry1Ac. The resulting evolved Cry1Ac variants bind TnCAD with high affinity (dissociation constant K-d = 11-41 nM), kill TnCAD-expressing insect cells that are not susceptible to wild-type Cry1Ac, and kill Cry1Ac-resistant T. ni insects up to 335-fold more potently than wild-type Cry1Ac. Our findings establish that the evolution of Bt toxins with novel insect cell receptor affinity can overcome insect Bt toxin resistance and confer lethality approaching that of the wild-type Bt toxin against non-resistant insects."], ["Thermodynamic determination of fragility in liquids and a fragile-to-strong liquid transition in water", "If crystallization can be avoided when a liquid is cooled, it will typically form a glass. Near the glass transition temperature the viscosity increases continuously but rapidly with cooling. As the glass forms, the molecular relaxation time increases with an Arrhenius-like (simple activated) form in some liquids, but shows highly non-Arrhenius behaviour in others. The former are said to be 'strong' liquids, and the latter 'fragile'(1,2). Here we show that the fragility of a liquid can be determined from purely thermodynamic data (as opposed to measurements of kinetics) near and below the melting point. We find that for most liquids the fragilities estimated this way are consistent with those obtained by previous methods and by a new method (ref. 3 and K.I., C.A.A. and C.T.M., unpublished data) at temperatures near the glass transition. But water is an exception. The thermodynamic method indicates that near its melting point it is the most fragile of all liquids studied, whereas the kinetic approach indicates that near the glass transition it is the least fragile. We propose that this discrepancy can be explained by a fragile-to-strong transition in supercooled water near 228 K, corresponding to a change in the liquid's structure at this point."], ["Hierarchical self-assembly of DNA into symmetric supramolecular polyhedra", "DNA is renowned for its double helix structure and the base pairing that enables the recognition and highly selective binding of complementary DNA strands. These features, and the ability to create DNA strands with any desired sequence of bases, have led to the use of DNA rationally to design various nanostructures and even execute molecular computations(1-4). Of the wide range of self- assembled DNA nanostructures reported, most are one- or two- dimensional(5-9). Examples of three- dimensional DNA structures include cubes(10), truncated octahedra(11), octohedra(12) and tetrahedra(13,14), which are all comprised of many different DNA strands with unique sequences. When aiming for large structures, the need to synthesize large numbers ( hundreds) of unique DNA strands poses a challenging design problem(9,15). Here, we demonstrate a simple solution to this problem: the design of basic DNA building units in such a way that many copies of identical units assemble into larger three- dimensional structures. We test this hierarchical self- assembly concept with DNA molecules that form three- point- star motifs, or tiles. By controlling the flexibility and concentration of the tiles, the one- pot assembly yields tetrahedra, dodecahedra or buckyballs that are tens of nanometres in size and comprised of four, twenty or sixty individual tiles, respectively. We expect that our assembly strategy can be adapted to allow the fabrication of a range of relatively complex three- dimensional structures."], ["A dearth of intermediate melts at subduction zone volcanoes and the petrogenesis of arc andesites", "Andesites represent a large proportion of the magmas erupted at continental arc volcanoes and are regarded as a major component in the formation of continental crust(1). Andesite petrogenesis is therefore fundamental in terms of both volcanic hazard and differentiation of the Earth. Andesites typically contain a significant proportion of crystals showing disequilibrium petrographic characteristics indicative of mixing or mingling between silicic and mafic magmas, which fuels a long-standing debate regarding the significance of these processes in andesite petrogenesis(2) and ultimately questions the abundance of true liquids with andesitic composition. Central to this debate is the distinction between liquids (or melts) and magmas, mixtures of liquids with crystals, which may or may not be co-genetic. With this distinction comes the realization that bulk-rock chemical analyses of petrologically complex andesites can lead to a blurred picture of the fundamental processes behind arc magmatism. Here we present an alternative view of andesite petrogenesis, based on a review of quenched glassy melt inclusions trapped in phenocrysts, whole-rock chemistry, and high-pressure and high-temperature experiments. We argue that true liquids of intermediate composition (59 to 66 wt% SiO2) are far less common in the sub-volcanic reservoirs of arc volcanoes than is suggested by the abundance of erupted magma within this compositional range. Effective mingling within upper crustal magmatic reservoirs obscures a compositional bimodality of melts ascending from the lower crust, and masks the fundamental role of silicic melts (>= 66 wt% SiO2) beneath intermediate arc volcanoes. This alternative view resolves several puzzling aspects of arc volcanism and provides important clues to the integration of plutonic and volcanic records."], ["Si=P Double Bonds: Experimental and Theoretical Study of an NHC-Stabilized Phosphasilenylidene", "An experimental and theoretical study of the first compound featuring a Si\uf8feP bond to a two-coordinate silicon atom is reported.

Comparative cyclic voltammetric and UV/Vis spectroscopic experiments of this compound, the disilicon(0) compound (IDipp)Si\uf8feSi(IDipp), and the diphosphene Mes*P\uf8fePMes* reveal, in combination with quantum chemical calculations, the isolobal relationship of the three double-bond systems."], ["Functional materials discovery using energy\u2013structure\u2013function maps", "Molecular crystals cannot be designed in the same manner as macroscopic objects, because they do not assemble according to simple, intuitive rules. Their structures result from the balance of many weak interactions, rather than from the strong and predictable bonding patterns found in metal\u2013organic frameworks and covalent organic frameworks. Hence, design strategies that assume a topology or other structural blueprint will often fail. Here we combine computational crystal structure prediction and property prediction to build energy\u2013structure\u2013function maps that describe the possible structures and properties that are available to a candidate molecule. Using these maps, we identify a highly porous solid, which has the lowest density reported for a molecular crystal so far. Both the structure of the crystal and its physical properties, such as methane storage capacity and guest-molecule selectivity, are predicted using the molecular structure as the only input. More generally, energy\u2013structure\u2013function maps could be used to guide the experimental discovery of materials with any target function that can be calculated from predicted crystal structures, such as electronic structure or mechanical properties."], ["Epitaxial single-crystal hexagonal boron nitride multilayers on Ni (111)", "Large-area single-crystal monolayers of two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene(1-3), hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)(4-6) and transition metal dichalcogenides(7,8) have been grown. hBN is considered to be the 'ideal' dielectric for 2D-materials-based field-effect transistors (FETs), offering the potential for extending Moore's law(9,10). Although hBN thicker than a monolayer is more desirable as substrate for 2D semiconductors(11,12), highly uniform and single-crystal multilayer hBN growth has yet to be demonstrated. Here we report the epitaxial growth of wafer-scale single-crystal trilayer hBN by a chemical vapour deposition (CVD) method. Uniformly aligned hBN islands are found to grow on single-crystal Ni (111) at early stage and finally to coalesce into a single-crystal film. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results show that a Ni23B6 interlayer is formed (during cooling) between the single-crystal hBN film and Ni substrate by boron dissolution in Ni. There are epitaxial relationships between hBN and Ni23B6 and between Ni23B6 and Ni. We also find that the hBN film acts as a protective layer that remains intact during catalytic evolution of hydrogen, suggesting continuous single-crystal hBN. This hBN transferred onto the SiO2 (300 nm)/Si wafer acts as a dielectric layer to reduce electron doping from the SiO2 substrate in MoS2 FETs.

We model these populations' deep relationships and show that early European farmers had similar to 44% ancestry from a 'basal Eurasian' population that split before the diversification of other non-African lineages."], ["Mitochondrial stress is relayed to the cytosol by an OMA1-DELE1-HRI pathway", "In mammalian cells, mitochondrial dysfunction triggers the integrated stress response, in which the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2 alpha) results in the induction of the transcription factor ATF4(1-3). However, how mitochondrial stress is relayed to ATF4 is unknown. Here we show that HRI is the eIF2 alpha kinase that is necessary and sufficient for this relay. In a genome-wide CRISPR interference screen, we identified factors upstream of HRI: OMA1, a mitochondrial stress-activated protease; and DELE1, a little-characterized protein that we found was associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane. Mitochondrial stress stimulates OMA1-dependent cleavage of DELE1 and leads to the accumulation of DELE1 in the cytosol, where it interacts with HRI and activates the eIF2 alpha kinase activity of HRI. In addition, DELE1 is required for ATF4 translation downstream of eIF2 alpha phosphorylation. Blockade of the OMA1-DELE1-HRI pathway triggers an alternative response in which specific molecular chaperones are induced. The OMA1-DELE1-HRI pathway therefore represents a potential therapeutic target that could enable fine-tuning of the integrated stress response for beneficial outcomes in diseases that involve mitochondrial dysfunction. A genome-wide CRISPR interference screen shows that a signalling pathway involving OMA1, DELE1 and the eIF2 alpha kinase HRI relays mitochondrial stress to the cytosol to trigger the integrated stress response."], ["Polymerized colloidal crystal hydrogel films as intelligent chemical sensing materials", "Chemical sensors' respond to the presence of a specific analyte in a variety of ways, One of the most convenient is a change in optical properties, and in particular a visually perceptible colour change. Here we report the preparation of a material that changes colour in response to a chemical signal by means of a change in diffraction (rather than absorption) properties. Our material is a crystalline colloidal array(2-12) of polymer spheres (roughly 100 nm diameter) polymerized within a hydrogel(13,14) that swells and shrinks reversibly in the presence of certain analytes (here metal ions and glucose). The crystalline colloidal array diffracts light at (visible) wavelengths determined by the lattice spacing(2-12), which gives rise to an intense colour. The hydrogel contains either a molecular-recognition group that binds the analyte selectively (crown ethers for metal ions), or a molecular-recognition agent that reacts with the analyte selectively. These recognition events cause the gel to swell owing to an increased osmotic pressure, which increases the mean separation between the colloidal spheres and so shifts the Bragg peak of the diffracted light to longer wavelengths. We anticipate that this strategy can be used to prepare 'intelligent' materials responsive to a wide range of analytes, including viruses."], ["Dense packings of the Platonic and Archimedean solids", "Dense particle packings have served as useful models of the structures of liquid, glassy and crystalline states of matter(1-4), granular media(3,5), heterogeneous materials(3) and biological systems(6-8).

Previous work has focused mainly on spherical particles-very little is known about dense polyhedral packings. Here we formulate the generation of dense packings of polyhedra as an optimization problem, using an adaptive fundamental cell subject to periodic boundary conditions (we term this the 'adaptive shrinking cell' scheme). Using a variety of multi-particle initial configurations, we find the densest known packings of the four non-tiling Platonic solids (the tetrahedron, octahedron, dodecahedron and icosahedron) in three-dimensional Euclidean space. The densities are 0.782..., 0.947..., 0.904... and 0.836..., respectively. Unlike the densest tetrahedral packing, which must not be a Bravais lattice packing, the densest packings of the other non-tiling Platonic solids that we obtain are their previously known optimal (Bravais) lattice packings. Combining our simulation results with derived rigorous upper bounds and theoretical arguments leads us to the conjecture that the densest packings of the Platonic and Archimedean solids with central symmetry are given by their corresponding densest lattice packings. This is the analogue of Kepler's sphere conjecture for these solids."], ["CO2 electrolysis to multicarbon products in strong acid", "Carbon dioxide electroreduction (CO2R) is being actively studied as a promising route to convert carbon emissions to valuable chemicals and fuels. However, the fraction of input CO2 that is productively reduced has typically been very low, <2% for multicarbon products; the balance reacts with hydroxide to form carbonate in both alkaline and neutral reactors. Acidic electrolytes would overcome this limitation, but hydrogen evolution has hitherto dominated under those conditions. We report that concentrating potassium cations in the vicinity of electrochemically active sites accelerates CO2 activation to enable efficient CO2R in acid. We achieve CO2R on copper at pH <1 with a single-pass CO2 utilization of 77%, including a conversion efficiency of 50% toward multicarbon products (ethylene, ethanol, and 1-propanol) at a current density of 1.2 amperes per square centimeter and a full-cell voltage of 4.2 volts."], ["TEMPO-Modified Linear Poly(ethylenimine) for Immobilization-Enhanced Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Alcohols", "We demonstrate a method to simultaneously immobilize the oxidation catalyst, TEMPO, while dramatically enhancing its electrocatalytic activity toward several biologically available alcohols.

For example, nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond have been used to record NMR signals from nanometre-scale samples(1-3), with sensitivity sufficient to detect the magnetic field produced by a single protein(4). However, the best reported spectral resolution for NMR of molecules using nitrogen-vacancy centres is about 100 hertz(5). This is insufficient to resolve the key spectral identifiers of molecular structure that are critical to NMR applications in chemistry, structural biology and materials research, such as scalar couplings (which require a resolution of less than ten hertz(6)) and small chemical shifts (which require a resolution of around one part per million of the nuclear Larmor frequency). Conventional, inductively detected NMR can provide the necessary high spectral resolution, but its limited sensitivity typically requires millimetre-scale samples, precluding applications that involve smaller samples, such as picolitre-volume chemical analysis or correlated optical and NMR microscopy. Here we demonstrate a measurement technique that uses a solid-state spin sensor (a magnetometer) consisting of an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy centres in combination with a narrowband synchronized readout protocol(7-9) to obtain NMR spectral resolution of about one hertz. We use this technique to observe NMR scalar couplings in a micrometre-scale sample volume of approximately ten picolitres. We also use the ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy centres to apply NMR to thermally polarized nuclear spins and resolve chemicalshift spectra from small molecules.

Opportunities for the application of fibrillated cellulose materials-which can be extracted from renewable resources-and broader manufacturing issues of scale-up, sustainability and synergy with the paper-making industry are discussed."], ["Interactions between macromolecules and ions: the Hofmeister series", "The Hofmeister series, first noted in 1888, ranks the relative influence of ions on the physical behavior of a wide variety of aqueous processes ranging from colloidal assembly to protein folding.

Recent time\u0002resolved and thermodynamic studies of water molecules in salt solutions, however, demonstrate that bulk water structure is not central to the Hofmeister effect.

Here, using NMR relaxation dispersion, we resolve a sequence-dependent kinetic network connecting G center dot T/U wobbles with three distinct Watson-Crick mismatches: two rapidly exchanging tautomeric species (G(enol)center dot T/U reversible arrow G center dot T-enol/U-enol; population less than 0.4%) and one anionic species (G center dot T-/U-; population around 0.001% at neutral pH). The sequence-dependent tautomerization or ionization step was inserted into a minimal kinetic mechanism for correct incorporation during replication after the initial binding of the nucleotide, leading to accurate predictions of the probability of dG center dot dT misincorporation across different polymerases and pH conditions and for a chemically modified nucleotide, and providing mechanisms for sequence-dependent misincorporation. Our results indicate that the energetic penalty for tautomerization and/or ionization accounts for an approximately 10(-2) to 10(-3)-fold discrimination against misincorporation, which proceeds primarily via tautomeric dG(enol)center dot dT and dG center dot dT(enol), with contributions from anionic dG center dot dT(-) dominant at pH 8.4 and above or for some mutagenic nucleotides."], ["Alkene 1,1-difunctionalizations via organometallic-radical relay", "Radical reactions play an important role in modern organic synthetic chemistry. The generation of carbon radicals from the homolytic cleavage of carbon\u2013metal bonds has been widely studied as a fundamental step in organometallic chemistry. However, the implementation of this phenomenon in catalysed cascade reactions, that is, an organometallic-radical relay, is a highly challenging undertaking due to transient radicals generated from these thermodynamically disfavoured endergonic processes. Here we disclose a set of catalytic alkene 1,1-difunctionalization reactions conceptually based on an organometallic-radical relay. This strategy enables a diversity of sp3/sp2 fragments and aryl groups to be simultaneously introduced to the same carbon of both terminal and internal alkenes with outstanding chemo- and regioselectivity. This study provides a concept for the generation of functionalized benzylic radicals, which are difficult to access by classical protocols, from non-radical feedstock alkenes and arylboronic acids."], ["Medulloblastoma exome sequencing uncovers subtype-specific somatic mutations", "Medulloblastomas are themost commonmalignant brain tumours in children(1). Identifying and understanding the genetic events that drive these tumours is critical for the development of more effective diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic strategies. Recently, our group and others described distinct molecular subtypes ofmedulloblastoma on the basis of transcriptional and copy number profiles(2-5). Here we use whole-exome hybrid capture and deep sequencing to identify somatic mutations across the coding regions of 92 primary medulloblastoma/normal pairs. Overall, medulloblastomas have low mutation rates consistent with other paediatric tumours, with a median of 0.35 non-silent mutations per megabase. We identified twelve genes mutated at statistically significant frequencies, including previously known mutated genes in medulloblastoma such as CTNNB1, PTCH1, MLL2, SMARCA4 andTP53. Recurrent somatic mutations were newly identified in an RNA helicase gene, DDX3X, often concurrent with CTNNB1 mutations, and in the nuclear co-repressor (N-CoR) complex genes GPS2, BCOR and LDB1. We show that mutant DDX3X potentiates transactivation of a TCF promoter and enhances cell viability in combination with mutant, but not wild-type, beta-catenin. Together, our study reveals the alteration ofWNT, hedgehog, histone methyltransferase and now N-CoR pathways across medulloblastomas and within specific subtypes of this disease, and nominates theRNA helicase DDX3X as a component of pathogenic b-catenin signalling in medulloblastoma."], ["Virtual screening of chemical libraries", "Virtual screening uses computer-based methods to discover new ligands on the basis of biological structures. Although widely heralded in the 1970s and 1980s, the technique has since struggled to meet its initial promise, and drug discovery remains dominated by empirical screening. Recent successes in predicting new ligands and their receptor-bound structures, and better rates of ligand discovery compared to empirical screening, have re-ignited interest in virtual screening, which is now widely used in drug discovery, albeit on a more limited scale than empirical screening."], ["Evidence for dynamically organized modularity in the yeast protein-protein interaction network", "In apparently scale-free protein-protein interaction networks, or 'interactome' networks(1,2), most proteins interact with few partners, whereas a small but significant proportion of proteins, the 'hubs', interact with many partners. Both biological and nonbiological scale-free networks are particularly resistant to random node removal but are extremely sensitive to the targeted removal of hubs(1). A link between the potential scale-free topology of interactome networks and genetic robustness(3,4) seems to exist, because knockouts of yeast genes(5,6) encoding hubs are approximately threefold more likely to confer lethality than those of non-hubs(1). Here we investigate how hubs might contribute to robustness and other cellular properties for protein protein interactions dynamically regulated both in time and in space. We uncovered two types of hub: 'party' hubs, which interact with most of their partners simultaneously, and 'date' hubs, which bind their different partners at different times or locations. Both in silico studies of network connectivity and genetic interactions described in vivo support a model of organized modularity in which date hubs organize the proteome, connecting biological processes-or modules(7)-to each other, whereas party hubs function inside modules."], ["Carbynes reloaded: Isolation of singlet metallocarbenes", "Metallocarbenes are the elusive electromers of the well-established carbyne complexes with subvalent carbon ligands.

Emergence and spread of resistance to them' raises risk of wiping out recent gains achieved in reducing worldwide malaria burden and threatens future malaria control and elimination on a global level. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed parasite genetic loci associated with artemisinin resistance'''. However, there is no consensus on biochemical targets of artemisinin. Whether and how these targets interact with genes identified by GWAS, remains unknown. Here we provide biochemical and cellular evidence that artemisinins are potent inhibitors of Plasmodium falciparum phosphatidylinosito1-3-kinase (PfPI3K), revealing an unexpected mechanism of action. In resistant clinical strains, increased PfPI3K was associated with the C580Y mutation in P. falciparum Kelch13 (PfKelch13), a primary marker of artemisinin resistance. Polyubiquitination of PfPI3K and its binding to PfKelch13 were reduced by the PfKelch13 mutation, which limited proteolysis of PfPI3K and thus increased levels of the kinase, as well as its lipid product phosphatidylinosito1-3-phosphate (PI3P). We find PI3P levels to be predictive of artemisinin resistance in both clinical and engineered laboratory parasites as well as across non-isogenic strains. Elevated PI3P induced artemisinin resistance in absence of PfKelch13 mutations, but remained responsive to regulation by PfKelch13. Evidence is presented for PI3P-dependent signalling in which transgenic expression of an additional kinase confers resistance. Together these data present PI3P as the key mediator of artemisinin resistance and the sole PfPI3K as an important target for malaria elimination."], ["TAK1 is a ubiquitin-dependent kinase of MKK and IKK", "TRAF6 is a signal transducer that activates I kappaB kinase (IKK) and Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) in response to pro-inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS)(1-4). IKK activation by TRAF6 requires two intermediary factors, TRAF6-regulated IKK activator 1 (TRIKA1) and TRIKA2 (ref. 5). TRIKA1 is a dimeric ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme complex composed of Ubc13 and Uev1A (or the functionally equivalent Mms2). This Ubc complex, together with TRAF6, catalyses the formation of a Lys 63 (K63)-linked polyubiquitin chain that mediates IKK activation through a unique proteasome-independent mechanism(5). Here we report the purification and identification of TRIKA2, which is composed of TAK1, TAB1 and TAB2, a protein kinase complex previously implicated in IKK activation through an unknown mechanism(6,7). We find that the TAK1 kinase complex phosphorylates and activates IKK in a manner that depends on TRAF6 and Ubc13-Uev1A. Moreover, the activity of TAK1 to phosphorylate MKK6, which activates the JNK-p38 kinase pathway, is directly regulated by K63-linked polyubiquitination. We also provide evidence that TRAF6 is conjugated by the K63 polyubiquitin chains. These results indicate that ubiquitination has an important regulatory role in stress response pathways, including those of IKK and JNK."], ["One Stone Two Birds\u2014Enantioselective Bimetallic Catalysis for \u03b1-Amino Acid Derivatives with an Allene Unit", "A highly enantioselective 2,3-allenylation of acyclic and cyclic \u03b1-imino carboxylates via a synergistic bimetallic Pd/Cu catalysis with the same commercially available (R,Rp)-iPr-FOXAP (also as Phosferrox, (R,R)-[2-(4\u2019-i-propyloxazolin-2\u2019-yl)ferrocenyl]diphenyl phosphine) ligand for both metals affording optically active 2,3-butadienyl \u03b1-amino acid derivatives in high to excellent yields with excellent enantioselectivities has been developed.

Here, by exploiting a natural mapping between vibrations in molecules and photons in waveguides, we demonstrate a reprogrammable photonic chip as a versatile simulation platform for a range of quantum dynamic behaviour in different molecules. We begin by simulating the time evolution of vibrational excitations in the harmonic approximation for several four-atom molecules, including H2CS, SO3, HNCO, HFHF, N-4 and P-4. We then simulate coherent and dephased energy transport in the simplest model of the peptide bond in proteins-N-methylacetamide-and simulate thermal relaxation and the effect of anharmonicities in H2O. Finally, we use multi-photon statistics with a feedback control algorithm to iteratively identify quantum states that increase a particular dissociation pathway of NH3.

Imaging by single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) has revealed that, on the surface of intact virions, mature pre-fusion Env transitions from a pre-triggered conformation (state 1) through a default intermediate conformation (state 2) to a conformation in which it is bound to three CD4 receptor molecules (state 3)(8-10). It is currently unclear how these states relate to known structures. Breakthroughs in the structural characterization of the HIV-1 Env trimer have previously been achieved by generating soluble and proteolytically cleaved trimers of gp140 Env that are stabilized by a disulfide bond, an isoleucine-to-proline substitution at residue 559 and a truncation at residue 664 (SOSIP. 664 trimers)(5,11-18). Cryo-electron microscopy studies have been performed with C-terminally truncated Env of the HIV-1(JR-FL) strain in complex with the antibody PGT151(19). Both approaches have revealed similar structures for Env. Although these structures have been presumed to represent the pre-triggered state 1 of HIV-1 Env, this hypothesis has never directly been tested. Here we use smFRET to compare the conformational states of Env trimers used for structural studies with native Env on intact virus. We find that the constructs upon which extant high-resolution structures are based predominantly occupy downstream conformations that represent states 2 and 3. Therefore, the structure of the pretriggered state-1 conformation of viral Env that has been identified by smFRET and that is preferentially stabilized by many broadly neutralizing antibodies-and thus of interest for the design of immunogens-remains unknown."], ["Multifunctional ferrofluid-infused surfaces with reconfigurable multiscale topography", "Developing adaptive materials with geometries that change in response to external stimuli provides fundamental insights into the links between the physical forces involved and the resultant morphologies and creates a foundation for technologically relevant dynamic systems(1,2). In particular, reconfigurable surface topography as a means to control interfacial properties(3) has recently been explored using responsive gels(4), shape-memory polymers(5), liquid crystals(6-8) and hybrid composites(9-14), including magnetically active slippery surfaces(12-14). However, these designs exhibit a limited range of topographical changes and thus a restricted scope of function. Here we introduce a hierarchical magnetoresponsive composite surface, made by infiltrating a ferrofluid into a microstructured matrix (termed ferrofluid-containing liquid-infused porous surfaces, or FLIPS). We demonstrate various topographical reconfigurations at multiple length scales and a broad range of associated emergent behaviours. An applied magneticf-ield gradient induces the movement of magnetic nanoparticles suspended in the ferrofluid, which leads to microscale flow of the ferrofluid first above and then within the microstructured surface. This redistribution changes the initially smooth surface of the ferrofluid (which is immobilized by the porous matrix through capillary forces) into various multiscale hierarchical topographies shaped by the size, arrangement and orientation of the confining microstructures in the magnetic field. We analyse the spatial and temporal dynamics of these reconfigurations theoretically and experimentally as a function of the balance between capillary and magnetic pressures(15-19) and of the geometric anisotropy of the FLIPS system. Several interesting functions at three different length scales are demonstrated: self-assembly of colloidal particles at the micrometre scale; regulated flow of liquid droplets at the millimetre scale; and switchable adhesion and friction, liquid pumping and removal of biofilms at the centimetre scale. We envision that FLIPS could be used as part of integrated control systems for the manipulation and transport of matter, thermal management, microfluidics and fouling-release materials."], ["Measuring mechanical tension across vinculin reveals regulation of focal adhesion dynamics", "Mechanical forces are central to developmental, physiological and pathological processes(1). However, limited understanding of force transmission within sub-cellular structures is a major obstacle to unravelling molecular mechanisms. Here we describe the development of a calibrated biosensor that measures forces across specific proteins in cells with piconewton (pN) sensitivity, as demonstrated by single molecule fluorescence force spectroscopy(2). The method is applied to vinculin, a protein that connects integrins to actin filaments and whose recruitment to focal adhesions (FAs) is force-dependent(3). We show that tension across vinculin in stable FAs is similar to 2.5 pN and that vinculin recruitment to FAs and force transmission across vinculin are regulated separately. Highest tension across vinculin is associated with adhesion assembly and enlargement. Conversely, vinculin is under low force in disassembling or sliding FAs at the trailing edge of migrating cells. Furthermore, vinculin is required for stabilizing adhesions under force. Together, these data reveal that FA stabilization under force requires both vinculin recruitment and force transmission, and that, surprisingly, these processes can be controlled independently."], ["Phytoplankton in the ocean use non-phosphorus lipids in response to phosphorus scarcity", "Phosphorus is an obligate requirement for the growth of all organisms; major biochemical reservoirs of phosphorus in marine plankton include nucleic acids and phospholipids(1-3). However, eukaryotic phytoplankton and cyanobacteria (that is, 'phytoplankton' collectively) have the ability to decrease their cellular phosphorus content when phosphorus in their environment is scarce(1,4,5). The biochemical mechanisms that allow phytoplankton to limit their phosphorus demand and still maintain growth are largely unknown. Here we show that phytoplankton, in regions of oligotrophic ocean where phosphate is scarce, reduce their cellular phosphorus requirements by substituting non-phosphorus membrane lipids for phospholipids. In the Sargasso Sea, where phosphate concentrations were less than 10 nmol l(-1), we found that only 1.3 +/- 0.6% of phosphate uptake was used for phospholipid synthesis; in contrast, in the South Pacific subtropical gyre, where phosphate was greater than 100 nmol l(-1), plankton used 17 +/- 6% (ref. 6). Examination of the planktonic membrane lipids at these two locations showed that classes of sulphur- and nitrogen-containing membrane lipids, which are devoid of phosphorus, were more abundant in the Sargasso Sea than in the South Pacific. Furthermore, these non-phosphorus, 'substitute lipids' were dominant in phosphorus-limited cultures of all of the phytoplankton species we examined. In contrast, the marine heterotrophic bacteria we examined contained no substitute lipids and only phospholipids. Thus heterotrophic bacteria, which compete with phytoplankton for nutrients in oligotrophic regions like the Sargasso Sea, appear to have a biochemical phosphorus requirement that phytoplankton avoid by using substitute lipids. Our results suggest that phospholipid substitutions are fundamental biochemical mechanisms that allow phytoplankton to maintain growth in the face of phosphorus limitation."], ["Additive manufacturing of ultrafine-grained high-strength titanium alloys", "Additive manufacturing, often known as three-dimensional (3D) printing, is a process in which a part is built layer-by-layer and is a promising approach for creating components close to their final (net) shape. This process is challenging the dominance of conventional manufacturing processes for products with high complexity and low material waste(1). Titanium alloys made by additive manufacturing have been used in applications in various industries. However, the intrinsic high cooling rates and high thermal gradient of the fusion-based metal additive manufacturing process often leads to a very fine microstructure and a tendency towards almost exclusively columnar grains, particularly in titanium-based alloys(1). (Columnar grains in additively manufactured titanium components can result in anisotropic mechanical properties and are therefore undesirable(2).) Attemptsto optimize the processing parameters of additive manufacturing have shown that it is difficult to alter the conditions to promote equiaxed growth of titaniumgrains(3). In contrast with other common engineering alloys such as aluminium, there is no commercial grain refiner for titanium that is able to effectively refine the microstructure. To address this challenge, here we report on the development of titanium-copper alloys that have a high constitutional supercooling capacity as a result of partitioning of the alloying element during solidification, which can override the negative effect of a high thermal gradient in the laser-melted region during additive manufacturing. Without any special process control or additional treatment, our as-printed titanium-copper alloy specimens have a fully equiaxed fine-grained microstructure. They also display promising mechanical properties, such as high yield strength and uniform elongation, compared to conventional alloys under similar processing conditions, owing to the formation of an ultrafine eutectoid microstructure that appears as a result of exploiting the high cooling rates and multiple thermal cycles of the manufacturing process. We anticipate that this approach will be applicable to other eutectoid-forming alloy systems, and that it will have applications in the aerospace and biomedical industries."], ["Reversal of ocean acidification enhances net coral reef calcification", "Approximately one-quarter of the anthropogenic carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere each year is absorbed by the global oceans, causing measurable declines in surface ocean pH, carbonate ion concentration ([CO32-]), and saturation state of carbonate minerals (Omega)(1). This process, referred to as ocean acidification, represents a major threat to marine ecosystems, in particular marine calcifiers such as oysters, crabs, and corals. Laboratory and field studies(2,3) have shown that calcification rates of many organisms decrease with declining pH, [CO32-], and Omega. Coral reefs are widely regarded as one of the most vulnerable marine ecosystems to ocean acidification, in part because the very architecture of the ecosystem is reliant on carbonate-secreting organisms(4). Acidification-induced reductions in calcification are projected to shift coral reefs from a state of net accretion to one of net dissolution this century(5). While retrospective studies show large-scale declines in coral, and community, calcification over recent decades(6-12), determining the contribution of ocean acidification to these changes is difficult, if not impossible, owing to the confounding effects of other environmental factors such as temperature. Here we quantify the net calcification response of a coral reef flat to alkalinity enrichment, and show that, when ocean chemistry is restored closer to pre-industrial conditions, net community calcification increases. In providing results from the first seawater chemistry manipulation experiment of a natural coral reef community, we provide evidence that net community calcification is depressed compared with values expected for pre-industrial conditions, indicating that ocean acidification may already be impairing coral reef growth."], ["Liquid-crystal-mediated self-assembly at nanodroplet interfaces", "Technological applications of liquid crystals have generally relied on control of molecular orientation at a surface or an interface(1,2). Such control has been achieved through topography, chemistry and the adsorption of monolayers or surfactants(2,3). The role of the substrate or interface has been to impart order over visible length scales and to confine the liquid crystal in a device. Here, we report results from a computational study of a liquid-crystal-based system in which the opposite is true: the liquid crystal is used to impart order on the interfacial arrangement of a surfactant. Recent experiments on macroscopic interfaces have hinted that an interfacial coupling between bulk liquid crystal and surfactant can lead to a two-dimensional phase separation of the surfactant at the interface(4), but have not had the resolution to measure the structure of the resulting phases. To enhance that coupling, we consider the limit of nanodroplets, the interfaces of which are decorated with surfactant molecules that promote local perpendicular orientation of mesogens within the droplet. In the absence of surfactant, mesogens at the interface are all parallel to that interface. As the droplet is cooled, the mesogens undergo a transition from a disordered (isotropic) to an ordered (nematic or smectic) liquid-crystal phase. As this happens, mesogens within the droplet cause a transition of the surfactant at the interface, which forms new ordered nanophases with morphologies dependent on surfactant concentration. Such nanophases are reminiscent of those encountered in block copolymers(5), and include circular, striped and worm-like patterns."], ["Observation of a many-body dynamical phase transition with a 53-qubit quantum simulator", "A quantum simulator is a type of quantum computer that controls the interactions between quantum bits (or qubits) in a way that can be mapped to certain quantum many-body problems(1,2). As it becomes possible to exert more control over larger numbers of qubits, such simulators will be able to tackle a wider range of problems, such as materials design and molecular modelling, with the ultimate limit being a universal quantum computer that can solve general classes of hard problems(3). Here we use a quantum simulator composed of up to 53 qubits to study non-equilibrium dynamics in the transverse-field Ising model with long-range interactions. We observe a dynamical phase transition after a sudden change of the Hamiltonian, in a regime in which conventional statistical mechanics does not apply(4). The qubits are represented by the spins of trapped ions, which can be prepared in various initial pure states. We apply a global long-range Ising interaction with controllable strength and range, and measure each individual qubit with an efficiency of nearly 99 per cent. Such high efficiency means that arbitrary many-body correlations between qubits can be measured in a single shot, enabling the dynamical phase transition to be probed directly and revealing computationally intractable features that rely on the long-range interactions and high connectivity between qubits."], ["The heat released during catalytic turnover enhances the diffusion of an enzyme", "Recent studies have shown that the diffusivity of enzymes increases in a substrate-dependent manner during catalysis(1,2). Although this observation has been reported and characterized for several different systems(3-10), the precise origin of this phenomenon is unknown. Calorimetric methods are often used to determine enthalpies from enzyme-catalysed reactions and can therefore provide important insight into their reaction mechanisms(11,12). The ensemble averages involved in traditional bulk calorimetry cannot probe the transient effects that the energy exchanged in a reaction may have on the catalyst. Here we obtain single-molecule fluorescence correlation spectroscopy data and analyse them within the framework of a stochastic theory to demonstrate a mechanistic link between the enhanced diffusion of a single enzyme molecule and the heat released in the reaction. We propose that the heat released during catalysis generates an asymmetric pressure wave that results in a differential stress at the protein-solvent interface that transiently displaces the centre-of-mass of the enzyme (chemoacoustic effect). This novel perspective on how enzymes respond to the energy released during catalysis suggests a possible effect of the heat of reaction on the structural integrity and internal degrees of freedom of the enzyme."], ["Site-Selective Acceptorless Dehydrogenation of Aliphatics Enabled by Organophotoredox/Cobalt Dual Catalysis", "The value of catalytic dehydrogenation of aliphatics (CDA) in organic synthesis has remained largely underexplored. Known homogeneous CDA systems often require the use of sacrificial hydrogen acceptors (or oxidants), precious metal catalysts, and harsh reaction conditions, thus limiting most existing methods to dehydrogenation of non- or low-functionalized alkanes. Here we describe a visible-light-driven, dual-catalyst system consisting of inexpensive organophotoredox and base-metal catalysts for room-temperature, acceptorless-CDA (Al-CDA). Initiated by photoexited 2-chloroanthraquinone, the process involves H atom transfer (HAT) of aliphatics to form alkyl radicals, which then react with cobaloxime to produce olefins and H2. This operationally simple method enables direct dehydrogenation of readily available chemical feedstocks to diversely functionalized olefins. For example, we demonstrate, for the first time, the oxidant-free desaturation of thioethers and amides to alkenyl sulfides and enamides, respectively. Moreover, the system\u2019s exceptional site selectivity and functional group tolerance are illustrated by late-stage dehydrogenation and synthesis of 14 biologically relevant molecules and pharmaceutical ingredients.

Here we describe a general strategy for the synthesis of highly ordered, rigid arrays of nanoporous carbon having uniform but tunable diameters (typically 6 nanometres inside and 9 nanometres outside). These structures are formed by using ordered mesoporous silicas as templates, the removal of which leaves a partially ordered graphitic framework. The resulting material supports a high dispersion of platinum nanoparticles, exceeding that of other common microporous carbon materials (such as carbon black, charcoal and activated carbon fibres). The platinum cluster diameter can be controlled to below 3 nanometres, and the high dispersion of these metal clusters gives rise to promising electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction, which could prove to be practically relevant for fuel-cell technologies. These nanomaterials can also be prepared in the form of free-standing films by using ordered silica films as the templates."], ["Intercellular wiring enables electron transfer between methanotrophic archaea and bacteria", "The anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) with sulfate controls the emission of the greenhouse gas methane from the ocean floor(1,2). In marine sediments, AOM is performed by dual-species consortia of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) inhabiting the methane-sulfate transition zone(3-5). The biochemical pathways and biological adaptations enabling this globally relevant process are not fully understood. Here we study the syntrophic interaction in thermophilic AOM (TAOM) between ANME-1 archaea and their consortium partner SRB HotSeep-1 (ref. 6) at 60 degrees C to test the hypothesis of a direct interspecies exchange of electrons(7,8.) The activity of TAOM consortia was compared to the first ANME-free culture of an AOM partner bacterium that grows using hydrogen as the sole electron donor. The thermophilic ANME-1 do not produce sufficient hydrogen to sustain the observed growth of the HotSeep-1 partner. Enhancing the growth of the HotSeep-1 partner by hydrogen addition represses methane oxidation and the metabolic activity of ANME-1. Further supporting the hypothesis of direct electron transfer between the partners, we observe that under TAOM conditions, both ANME and the HotSeep-1 bacteria overexpress genes for extracellular cytochrome production and form cell-to-cell connections that resemble the nanowire structures responsible for interspecies electron transfer between syntrophic consortia of Geobacter(9,10). HotSeep-1 highly expresses genes for pili production only during consortial growth using methane, and the nanowire-like structures are absent in HotSeep-1 cells isolated with hydrogen. These observations suggest that direct electron transfer is a principal mechanism in TAOM, which may also explain the enigmatic functioning and specificity of other methanotrophic ANME-SRB consortia."], ["A platinum(II) metallonitrene with a triplet ground state", "Metallonitrenes (M\u2013N) are complexes with a subvalent atomic nitrogen ligand that have been proposed as key reactive intermediates in nitrogen atom transfer reactions.

Synthetic hydrogels have been created using methods such as electro-spinning2, extrusion3, compositing4,5, freeze-casting6,7, self-assembly8 and mechanical stretching9,10 for improved mechanical performance. However, in contrast to tendons, many hydrogels with the same high water content do not show high strength, toughness or fatigue resistance. Here we present a strategy to produce a multi-length-scale hierarchical hydrogel architecture using a freezing-assisted salting-out treatment. The produced poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogels are highly anisotropic, comprising micrometre-scale honeycomb-like pore walls, which in turn comprise interconnected nanofibril meshes. These hydrogels have a water content of 70\u201395 per cent and properties that compare favourably to those of other tough hydrogels and even natural tendons; for example, an ultimate stress of 23.5 \u00b1 2.7 megapascals, strain levels of 2,900 \u00b1 450 per cent, toughness of 210 \u00b1 13 megajoules per cubic metre, fracture energy of 170 \u00b1 8 kilojoules per square metre and a fatigue threshold of 10.5 \u00b1 1.3 kilojoules per square metre.

Time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy is in this context a direct and comprehensive, energy- and momentum-selective probe of the ultrafast processes that couple to the electronic degrees of freedom(7-10). Previously, the capability of such studies to access electron momentum space away from zero momentum was, however, restricted owing to limitations of the available probing photon energy(10,11). Here, using femtosecond extreme-ultraviolet pulses delivered by a high-harmonic-generation source, we use time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to measure the photoinduced vaporization of a charge-ordered state in the potential excitonic insulator 1T-TiSe(2) (refs 12, 13). By way of stroboscopic imaging of electronic band dispersions at large momentum, in the vicinity of the edge of the first Brillouin zone, we reveal that the collapse of atomic-scale periodic long-range order happens on a timescale as short as 20 femtoseconds. The surprisingly fast response of the system is assigned to screening by the transient generation of free charge carriers. Similar screening scenarios are likely to be relevant in other photoinduced solid-state transitions and may generally determine the response times. Moreover, as electron states with large momenta govern fundamental electronic properties in condensed matter systems(14), we anticipate that the experimental advance represented by the present study will be useful to study the ultrafast dynamics and microscopic mechanisms of electronic phenomena in a wide range of materials."], ["Supercritical fluids as solvents for chemical and materials processing", "Fluids near their critical point have dissolving power comparable to that of liquids, are much more compressible than dilute gases, and have transport properties intermediate between gas- and liquid-like.

With advances in mass-spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics, 90,000 sites of serine and threonine phosphorylation have so far been identified, and several thousand have been associated with human diseases and biological processes(3,4). For the vast majority of phosphorylation events, it is not yet known which of the more than 300 protein serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) kinases encoded in the human genome are responsible(3). Here we used synthetic peptide libraries to profile the substrate sequence specificity of 303 Ser/Thr kinases, comprising more than 84% of those predicted to be active in humans. Viewed in its entirety, the substrate specificity of the kinome was substantially more diverse than expected and was driven extensively by negative selectivity. We used our kinome-wide dataset to computationally annotate and identify the kinases capable of phosphorylating every reported phosphorylation site in the human Ser/Thr phosphoproteome. For the small minority of phosphosites for which the putative protein kinases involved have been previously reported, our predictions were in excellent agreement. When this approach was applied to examine the signalling response of tissues and cell lines to hormones, growth factors, targeted inhibitors and environmental or genetic perturbations, it revealed unexpected insights into pathway complexity and compensation. Overall, these studies reveal the intrinsic substrate specificity of the human Ser/Thr kinome, illuminate cellular signalling responses and provide a resource to link phosphorylation events to biological pathways."], ["Pathogen blocks host death receptor signalling by arginine GlcNAcylation of death domains", "The tumour necrosis factor (TNF) family is crucial for immune homeostasis, cell death and inflammation. These cytokines are recognized by members of the TNF receptor (TNFR) family of death receptors, including TNFR1 and TNFR2, and FAS and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors(1). Death receptor signalling requires death-domain-mediated homotypic/heterotypic interactions between the receptor and its downstream adaptors, including TNFR1-associated death domain protein (TRADD) and FAS-associated death domain protein (FADD)(2). Here we discover that death domains in several proteins, including TRADD, FADD, RIPK1 and TNFR1, were directly inactivated by NleB, an entero-pathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) type III secretion system effector known to inhibit host nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) signalling(3,4). NleB contained an unprecedented N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) transferase activity that specifically modified a conserved arginine in these death domains (Arg 235 in the TRADD death domain). NleB GlcNAcylation (the addition of GlcNAc onto a protein side chain) of death domains blocked homotypic/heterotypic death domain interactions and assembly of the oligomeric TNFR1 complex, thereby disrupting TNF signalling in EPEC-infected cells, including NF-kappa B signalling, apoptosis and necroptosis. Type-III-delivered NleB also blocked FAS ligand and TRAIL-induced cell death by preventing formation of a FADD-mediated death-inducing signalling complex (DISC). The arginine GlcNAc transferase activity of NleB was required for bacterial colonization in the mouse model of EPEC infection. The mechanism of action of NleB represents a new model by which bacteria counteract host defences, and also a previously unappreciated post-translational modification."], ["Transition Metal-Catalyzed C\u2013H Amination: Scope, Mechanism, and Applications", "Catalytic transformation of ubiquitous C\u2013H bonds into valuable C\u2013N bonds offers an efficient synthetic approach to construct N-functionalized molecules.

The abundance of star-forming galaxies is known to decline(4,5) from redshifts of about 6 to 10, but a key question is the extent of star formation at even earlier times, corresponding to the period when the first galaxies might have emerged. Here we report spectroscopic observations of MACS1149-JD1(6), a gravitationally lensed galaxy observed when the Universe was less than four per cent of its present age. We detect an emission line of doubly ionized oxygen at a redshift of 9.1096 +/- 0.0006, with an uncertainty of one standard deviation. This precisely determined redshift indicates that the red rest-frame optical colour arises from a dominant stellar component that formed about 250 million years after the Big Bang, corresponding to a redshift of about 15. Our results indicate that it may be possible to detect such early episodes of star formation in similar galaxies with future telescopes."], ["Molecular understanding of sulphuric acid-amine particle nucleation in the atmosphere", "Nucleation of aerosol particles from trace atmospheric vapours is thought to provide up to half of global cloud condensation nuclei(1). Aerosols can cause a net cooling of climate by scattering sunlight and by leading to smaller but more numerous cloud droplets, which makes clouds brighter and extends their lifetimes(2). Atmospheric aerosols derived from human activities are thought to have compensated for a large fraction of the warming caused by greenhouse gases(2). However, despite its importance for climate, atmospheric nucleation is poorly understood. Recently, it has been shown that sulphuric acid and ammonia cannot explain particle formation rates observed in the lower atmosphere(3). It is thought that amines may enhance nucleation(4-16), but until now there has been no direct evidence for amine ternary nucleation under atmospheric conditions. Here we use the CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving OUtdoor Droplets) chamber at CERN and find that dimethylamine above three parts per trillion by volume can enhance particle formation rates more than 1,000-fold compared with ammonia, sufficient to account for the particle formation rates observed in the atmosphere. Molecular analysis of the clusters reveals that the faster nucleation is explained by a base-stabilization mechanism involving acid-amine pairs, which strongly decrease evaporation. The ion-induced contribution is generally small, reflecting the high stability of sulphuric acid-dimethylamine clusters and indicating that galactic cosmic rays exert only a small influence on their formation, except at low overall formation rates. Our experimental measurements are well reproduced by a dynamical model based on quantum chemical calculations of binding energies of molecular clusters, without any fitted parameters. These results show that, in regions of the atmosphere near amine sources, both amines and sulphur dioxide should be considered when assessing the impact of anthropogenic activities on particle formation."], ["1H and 19F PGSE diffusion and HOESY NMR studies on cationic palladium (II) 1,3\u2010diphenylallyl complexes in THF solution", "THF solutions of the cationic chiral 1,3-diphenylallyl bidentate phosphine complexes [Pd(\u03b73-PhCHCHCHPh)(Duphos)](CF3SO3), Duphos = 1,2-Bis-((2R,5R)-2,5-dimethylphospholano)benzene), 2, and [Pd(\u03b73-PhCHCHCHPh)(P,S)]BF4, 4, P,S = [8-((o-(diphenylphosphino)benzyl) thiomethyl]\u2014(7,7\u2032-dimethyl)-exo-norborneol, have been studied via pulsed gradient spin-echo (PGSE) diffusion, 1H, 19F HOESY and a variety of other multi-dimensional NMR methods.

This reaction is generally achieved with transition metals (TMs) through interception by carbon sources of an alkylmetal [\u03b2-H\u2013C(sp3)\u2013[M]] species, a key intermediate prone to undergo rapid \u03b2-H elimination. Related prior reports, since Paolo Chiusoli and Catellani\u2019s work in 1982 [ Tetrahedron Lett. 1982, 23, 4517], have used bicyclic and disubstituted terminal alkenes, wherein \u03b2-H elimination is avoided by geometric restriction or complete lack of \u03b2-H\u2019s. With reasoning that \u03b2-H\u2013C(sp3)\u2013[M] intermediates could be rendered amenable to interception with the use of first row late TMs and formation of coordination-assisted transient metallacycles, these two strategies were implemented to address the \u03b2-H elimination problem in alkene dicarbofunctionalization reactions.\nBecause first row late TMs catalyze C(sp3)\u2013C(sp3) coupling, Cu and Ni were anticipated to impart sufficient stability to \u03b2-H\u2013C(sp3)\u2013[M] intermediates, generated catalytically upon alkene carbometalation, for their subsequent interception by carbon electrophiles/nucleophiles in three-component reactions. Additionally, such an innate property could enable alkene difunctionalization with carbon coupling partners through entropically driven cyclization/coupling reactions. The cyclometalation concept to stabilize intractable \u03b2-H\u2013C(sp3)\u2013[M] intermediates was hypothesized when three-component reactions were performed. The idea of cyclometalation to curtail \u03b2-H elimination is founded upon Whitesides\u2019s [ J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1976, 98, 6521] observation that metallacycles undergo \u03b2-H elimination much slower than acyclic alkylmetals.\nIn this Account, examples of alkene dicarbofunctionalization reactions demonstrate that Cu and Ni catalysts could enable cyclization/coupling of alkenylzinc reagents, alkyl halides, and aryl halides to afford complex carbo- and heterocycles. In addition, forming coordination-assisted transient nickellacycles enabled regioselective performance of three-component dicarbofunctionalization of various alkenyl compounds. In situ reaction of [M]-H with alkenes generated after \u03b2-H elimination induced an unprecedented metallacycle contraction process, in which six-membered metal-containing rings shrank to five-membered cycles, allowing creation of new carbon\u2013carbon bonds at allylic (1,3) positions. Applications of these regioselective alkene dicarbofunctionalization reactions are discussed."], ["Alkoxy-functionalized ionic liquid electrolytes: understanding ionic coordination of calcium ion speciation for the rational design of calcium electrolytes", "There is growing interest in the rational design of electrolytes for multivalent-ion batteries by tuning the molecular-level interactions of solvate species present in the electrolytes. Herein, we report our effort to control Ca-ion speciation in ionic liquid (IL) based electrolytes through the design of alkoxy-functionalized cations. Quantitative analysis reveals that the alkoxy-functionalized ammonium cation (N07+), bearing seven ether oxygen atoms, can effectively displace the bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anion (TFSI\u2212) from the Ca2+ ion coordination sphere, facilitating the reversible Ca deposition/stripping process. More importantly, post-analysis of Ca deposits surface chemistry and density functional theory calculations of Ca-ion speciation indicate the formation of an organic-rich, but inorganic-poor solid electrolyte interphase layer, which enables Ca2+ ion diffusion rather than passivating the Ca metal electrode. Finally, as a proof-of-concept, a prototype Ca/V2O5 cell using the optimized IL-based electrolyte ([Ca(BH4)2]0.05[N07TFSI]0.95) is demonstrated for the first time, exhibiting a remarkable initial discharge capacity of 332 mA h g\u22121 and reversible capacity of 244 mA h g\u22121."], ["Free-standing mesoporous silica films with tunable chiral nematic structures", "Chirality at the molecular level is found in diverse biological structures, such as polysaccharides, proteins and DNA, and is responsible for many of their unique properties(1). Introducing chirality into porous inorganic solids may produce new types of materials that could be useful for chiral separation, stereospecific catalysis, chiral recognition (sensing) and photonic materials(2-5). Template synthesis of inorganic solids using the self-assembly of lyotropic liquid crystals offers access to materials with well-defined porous structures(6-12), but only recently has chirality been introduced into hexagonal mesostructures through the use of a chiral surfactant(13,14). Efforts to impart chirality at a larger length scale using self-assembly are almost unknown. Here we describe the development of a photonic mesoporous inorganic solid that is a cast of a chiral nematic liquid crystal formed from nanocrystalline cellulose. These materials may be obtained as free-standing films with high surface area. The peak reflected wavelength of the films can be varied across the entire visible spectrum and into the near-infrared through simple changes in the synthetic conditions. To the best of our knowledge these are the first materials to combine mesoporosity with long-range chiral ordering that produces photonic properties.

Selection for survival in the presence of antibiotics produced the first genetic link to multidrug tolerance: a mutant in the Escherichia coli hipA locus. HipA encodes a serine-protein kinase, the multidrug tolerance activity of which is neutralized by binding to the transcriptional regulator HipB and hipBA promoter. The physiological role of HipA in multidrug tolerance, however, has been unclear. Here we show that wild-type HipA contributes to persister formation and that high-persister hipA mutants cause multidrug tolerance in urinary tract infections. Perplexingly, high-persister mutations map to the N-subdomain-1 of HipA far from its active site. Structures of higher-order HipA-HipB-promoter complexes reveal HipA forms dimers in these assemblies via N-subdomain-1 interactions that occlude their active sites. High-persistence mutations, therefore, diminish HipA-HipA dimerization, thereby unleashing HipA to effect multidrug tolerance.

This divergent Cas9 protein was found in little studied nanoarchaea as part of an active CRISPR-Cas system.

The marked deposition of parenchymal and vascular A beta in these relatively young individuals with treatment-induced (iatrogenic) CJD (iCJD), in contrast to other prion-disease patients and population controls, allied with the ability of Alzheimer's disease brain homogenates to seed A beta deposition in laboratory animals, led us to argue that the implicated c-hGH batches might have been contaminated with A beta seeds as well as with prions. However, this was necessarily an association, and not an experimental, study in humans and causality could not be concluded. Given the public health importance of our hypothesis, we proceeded to identify and biochemically analyse archived vials of c-hGH. Here we show that certain c-hGH batches to which patients with iCJD and A beta pathology were exposed have substantial levels of A beta(40), A beta(42) and tau proteins, and that this material can seed the formation of A beta plaques and cerebral A beta-amyloid angiopathy in intracerebrally inoculated mice expressing a mutant, humanized amyloid precursor protein. These results confirm the presence of A beta seeds in archived c-hGH vials and are consistent with the hypothesized iatrogenic human transmission of A beta pathology. This experimental confirmation has implications for both the prevention and the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and should prompt a review of the risk of iatrogenic transmission of A beta seeds by medical and surgical procedures long recognized to pose a risk of accidental prion transmission(2,3)."], ["Increasing stability, efficiency, and fundamental understanding of lithium-mediated electrochemical nitrogen reduction", "Lithium-mediated nitrogen reduction is a proven method to electrochemically synthesize ammonia; yet the process has so far been unstable, and the continuous deposition of lithium limits its practical applicability.

The Arabidopsis thaliana mutant bor1-1 is sensitive to boron deficiency(7,8). Uptake studies indicated that xylem loading is the key step for boron accumulation in shoots with a low external boron supply and that the bor1-1 mutant is defective in this process. Positional cloning identified BOR1 as a membrane protein with homology to bicarbonate transporters in animals. Moreover, a fusion protein of BOR1 and green fluorescent protein (GFP) localized to the plasma membrane in transformed cells. The promoter of BOR1 drove GFP expression in root pericycle cells.

However, alkyl cross-couplings using native sp(3)-hybridized functional groups such as alcohols remain relatively underdeveloped(2). In particular, a robust and general method for the direct deoxygenative coupling of alcohols would have major implications for the field of organic synthesis. A general method for the direct deoxygenative cross-coupling of free alcohols must overcome several challenges, most notably the in situ cleavage of strong C-O bonds(3), but would allow access to the vast collection of commercially available, structurally diverse alcohols as coupling partners(4). We report herein a metallaphotoredox-based cross-coupling platform in which free alcohols are activated in situ by N-heterocyclic carbene salts for carbon-carbon bond formation with aryl halide coupling partners.

For this reason, it is important to understand the response of pelagic biota to increased iron supply. Here we report the results of a mesoscale iron fertilization experiment in the polar Southern Ocean, where the potential to sequester iron-elevated algal carbon is probably greatest. Increased iron supply led to elevated phytoplankton biomass and rates of photosynthesis in surface waters, causing a large drawdown of carbon dioxide and macronutrients, and elevated dimethyl sulphide levels after 13 days. This drawdown was mostly due to the proliferation of diatom stocks. But downward export of biogenic carbon was not increased. Moreover, satellite observations of this massive bloom 30 days later, suggest that a sufficient proportion of the added iron was retained in surface waters. Our findings demonstrate that iron supply controls phytoplankton growth and community composition during summer in these polar Southern Ocean waters, but the fate of algal carbon remains unknown and depends on the interplay between the processes controlling export, remineralisation and timescales of water mass subduction."], ["Wafer-scale heterostructured piezoelectric bio-organic thin films", "Piezoelectric biomaterials are intrinsically suitable for coupling mechanical and electrical energy in biological systems to achieve in vivo real-time sensing, actuation, and electricity generation.

The heterostructured glycine-PVA films exhibit piezoelectric coefficients of 5.3 picocoulombs per newton or 157.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 volt meters per newton and nearly an order of magnitude enhancement of the mechanical flexibility compared with pure glycine crystals. With its natural compatibility and degradability in physiological environments, glycine-PVA films may enable the development of transient implantable electromechanical devices."], ["Two chemosensory receptors together mediate carbon dioxide detection in <i>Drosophila</i>", "Blood-feeding insects, including the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae, use highly specialized and sensitive olfactory systems to locate their hosts. This is accomplished by detecting and following plumes of volatile host emissions, which include carbon dioxide (CO2)(1). CO2 is sensed by a population of olfactory sensory neurons in the maxillary palps of mosquitoes(2,3) and in the antennae of the more genetically tractable fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster(4). The molecular identity of the chemosensory CO2 receptor, however, remains unknown. Here we report that CO2-responsive neurons in Drosophila co-express a pair of chemosensory receptors, Gr21a and Gr63a, at both larval and adult life stages. We identify mosquito homologues of Gr21a and Gr63a, GPRGR22 and GPRGR24, and show that these are co-expressed in A. gambiae maxillary palps. We show that Gr21a and Gr63a together are sufficient for olfactory CO2-chemosensation in Drosophila. Ectopic expression of Gr21a and Gr63a together confers CO2 sensitivity on CO2-insensitive olfactory neurons, but neither gustatory receptor alone has this function. Mutant flies lacking Gr63a lose both electrophysiological and behavioural responses to CO2. Knowledge of the molecular identity of the insect olfactory CO2 receptors may spur the development of novel mosquito control strategies designed to take advantage of this unique and critical olfactory pathway. This in turn could bolster the worldwide fight against malaria and other insect-borne diseases."], ["Science and technology for water purification in the coming decades", "One of the most pervasive problems afflicting people throughout the world is inadequate access to clean water and sanitation. Problems with water are expected to grow worse in the coming decades, with water scarcity occurring globally, even in regions currently considered water- rich. Addressing these problems calls out for a tremendous amount of research to be conducted to identify robust new methods of purifying water at lower cost and with less energy, while at the same time minimizing the use of chemicals and impact on the environment. Here we highlight some of the science and technology being developed to improve the disinfection and decontamination of water, as well as efforts to increase water supplies through the safe re- use of wastewater and efficient desalination of sea and brackish water."], ["A series of energetic metal pentazolate hydrates", "Singly or doubly bonded polynitrogen compounds can decompose to dinitrogen (N-2) with an extremely large energy release. This makes them attractive as potential explosives or propellants(1-3), but also challenging to produce in a stable form. Polynitrogen materials containing nitrogen as the only element exist in the form of high-pressure polymeric phases(4-6), but under ambient conditions even metastability is realized only in the presence of other elements that provide stabilization. An early example is the molecule phenylpentazole, with a five-membered all-nitrogen ring, which was first reported in the 1900s(7) and characterized in the 1950s(8,9). Salts containing the azide anion (N-3(-))(10-12) or pentazenium cation (N-5(+))(13) are also known, with compounds containing the pentazole anion, cyclo-N-5(-), a more recent addition(14-16). Very recently, a bulk material containing this species was reported(17) and then used to prepare the first example of a solid-state metal-N-5 complex(18). Here we report the synthesis and characterization of five metal pentazolate hydrate complexes [Na(H2O)(N-5)]center dot 2H(2)O, [M(H2O)(4)(N-5)(2)]center dot 4H(2)O (M = Mn, Fe and Co) and [Mg(H2O)(6)(N-5)(2)]center dot 4H(2)O that, with the exception of the Co complex, exhibit good thermal stability with onset decomposition temperatures greater than 100 degrees C. For this series we find that the N-5(-) ion can coordinate to the metal cation through either ionic or covalent interactions, and is stabilized through hydrogen-bonding interactions with water. Given their energetic properties and stability, pentazole-metal complexes might potentially serve as a new class of high-energy density materials(19) or enable the development of such materials containing only nitrogen(20-23). We also anticipate that the adaptability of the N-5(-) ion in terms of its bonding interactions will enable the exploration of inorganic nitrogen analogues of metallocenes(24) and other unusual polynitrogen complexes."], ["Impact of Glyme Ether Chain Length on the Interphasial Stability of Lithium-Electrode in High-Capacity Lithium-Metal Battery", "The realization of lithium-metal (Li) batteries faces challenges due to dendritic Li deposition causing internal short-circuit and low Coulombic efficiency. In this regard, the Li-deposition stability largely depends on the electrolyte, which reacts with Li to form a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with diverse physico-chemical properties, and dictates the interphasial kinetics. Therefore, optimizing the electrolyte for stability and performance remains pivotal. Hereof, glyme ethers are an emerging class of electrolytes, showing improved compatibility with metallic Li and enhanced stability in Li\u2500Air and Li\u2500Sulfur batteries. Yet, the criteria for selecting glyme solvents, particularly concerning Li deposition and dissolution processes, remain unclear. The SEI characteristics and Li deposition/dissolution processes are investigated in glyme-ether-based electrolytes with varying chain lengths, using lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and lithium nitrate (LiNO\u2083) salts under high capacity and limited electrolyte conditions. Longer glymes led to more homogeneous SEI, particularly pronounced with LiNO\u2083, minimizing surface roughness during stripping, and promoting compact Li deposits. Higher reductive stability, resulting in homogeneous interphasial properties, and slower kinetics due to high desolvation barrier and viscosity, underline stable Li growth in longer glymes. This study clarifies factors guiding the selection of glyme ether-based electrolytes in Li metal batteries, offering insights for next-generation energy storage systems."], ["Systems of mechanized and reactive droplets powered by multi-responsive surfactants", "Although 'active' surfactants, which are responsive to individual external stimuli such as temperature(1), electric(2,3) or magnetic(4) fields, light(5,6), redox processes(6,7) or chemical agents(8), are well known, it would be interesting to combine several of these properties within one surfactant species. Such multi-responsive surfactants could provide ways of manipulating individual droplets and possibly assembling them into larger systems of dynamic reactors(9,10). Here we describe surfactants based on functionalized nanoparticle dimers that combine all of these and several other characteristics. These surfactants and therefore the droplets that they cover are simultaneously addressable by magnetic, optical and electric fields. As a result, the surfactant-covered droplets can be assembled into various hierarchical structures, including dynamic ones, in which light powers the rapid rotation of the droplets. Such rotating droplets can transfer mechanical torques to their non-nearest neighbours, thus acting like systems of mechanical gears. Furthermore, droplets of different types can be merged by applying electric fields and, owing to interfacial jamming(11,12), can form complex, non-spherical, 'patchy' structures with different surface regions covered with different surfactants. In systems of droplets that carry different chemicals, combinations of multiple stimuli can be used to control the orientations of the droplets, inter-droplet transport, mixing of contents and, ultimately, sequences of chemical reactions. Overall, the multi-responsive active surfactants that we describe provide an unprecedented level of flexibility with which liquid droplets can be manipulated, assembled and reacted."], ["Catalytic Cleavage of C(sp2)\u2013C(sp2) Bonds with Rh-Carbynoids", "We report a catalytic strategy that generates rhodium-carbynoids by selective diazo activation of designed carbyne sources. We found that rhodium-carbynoid species provoke C(sp2)\u2013C(sp2) bond scission in alkenes by inserting a monovalent carbon unit between both sp2-hybridized carbons. This skeletal remodeling process accesses synthetically useful allyl cation intermediates that conduct to valuable allylic building blocks upon nucleophile attack.

Mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene are linked to familial Parkinson's disease(1,2) and alpha-synuclein accumulates in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites(3-5). Here we express normal and mutant forms of alpha-synuclein in Drosophila and produce adult-onset loss of dopaminergic neurons, filamentous intraneuronal inclusions containing alpha-synuclein and locomotor dysfunction. Our Drosophila model thus recapitulates the essential features of the human disorder, and makes possible a powerful genetic approach to Parkinson's disease."], ["Structure and mechanism of the M2 proton channel of influenza A virus", "The integral membrane protein M2 of influenza virus forms pH-gated proton channels in the viral lipid envelope(1). The low pH of an endosome activates the M2 channel before haemagglutinin-mediated fusion. Conductance of protons acidifies the viral interior and thereby facilitates dissociation of the matrix protein from the viral nucleoproteins - a required process for unpacking of the viral genome(2). In addition to its role in release of viral nucleoproteins, M2 in the trans- Golgi network ( TGN) membrane prevents premature conformational rearrangement of newly synthesized haemagglutinin during transport to the cell surface by equilibrating the pH of the TGN with that of the host cell cytoplasm(3). Inhibiting the proton conductance of M2 using the anti- viral drug amantadine or rimantadine inhibits viral replication(4-7). Here we present the structure of the tetrameric M2 channel in complex with rimantadine, determined by NMR. In the closed state, four tightly packed transmembrane helices define a narrow channel, in which a 'tryptophan gate' is locked by intermolecular interactions with aspartic acid. A carboxy- terminal, amphipathic helix oriented nearly perpendicular to the transmembrane helix forms an inward- facing base. Lowering the pH destabilizes the transmembrane helical packing and unlocks the gate, admitting water to conduct protons, whereas the C- terminal base remains intact, preventing dissociation of the tetramer. Rimantadine binds at four equivalent sites near the gate on the lipid- facing side of the channel and stabilizes the closed conformation of the pore. Drug-resistance mutations are predicted to counter the effect of drug binding by either increasing the hydrophilicity of the pore or weakening helix - helix packing, thus facilitating channel opening."], ["Visualizing vibrational normal modes of a single molecule with atomically confined light", "The internal vibrations of molecules drive the structural transformations that underpin chemistry and cellular function. While vibrational frequencies are measured by spectroscopy, the normal modes of motion are inferred through theory because their visualization would require microscopy with angstrom-scale spatial resolution-nearly three orders of magnitude smaller than the diffraction limit in optics(1). Using a metallic tip to focus light and taking advantage of the surface-enhanced Raman effect(2) to amplify the signal from individual molecules, tip-enhanced Raman spectromicroscopy (TER-SM)(3,4) reaches the requisite sub-molecular spatial resolution(5), confirming that light can be confined in picocavities(6-10) and anticipating the direct visualization of molecular vibrations(11-13). Here, by using TER-SM at the precisely controllable junction of a cryogenic ultrahigh-vacuum scanning tunnelling microscope(14-16), we show that angstrom-scale resolution is attained at subatomic separation between the tip atom and a molecule in the quantum tunnelling regime of plasmons(6,8,9,17). We record vibrational spectra within a single molecule, obtain images of normal modes and atomically parse the intramolecular charges and currents driven by vibrations. Our analysis provides a paradigm for optics in the atomistic near-field."], ["Caspase-12 mediates endoplasmic-reticulum-specific apoptosis and cytotoxicity by amyloid-\u03b2", "Apoptosis, or cellular suicide, is important for normal development and tissue homeostasis, but too much or too Little apoptosis can also cause disease(1,2). The family of cysteine proteases, the so-called caspases, are critical mediators of programmed cell death(3), and thus far 14 family members have been identified. Some of these, such as caspase-(8) (refs 4, 5), mediate signal transduction downstream of death receptors located on the plasma membrane. Others, such as caspase-9 (ref. 6), mediate apoptotic signals after mitochondrial damage. Stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) can also result in apoptosis(7). Here we show that caspase-12 is localized to the ER and activated by ER stress, including disruption of ER calcium homeostasis and accumulation of excess proteins in ER, but not by membrane- or mitochondrial-targeted apoptotic signals. Mice that are deficient in caspase-12 are resistant to ER stress-induced apoptosis, but their cells undergo apoptosis in response to other death stimuli. Furthermore, we show that caspase-12-deficient cortical neurons are defective in apoptosis induced by amyloid-beta protein but not by staurosporine or trophic factor deprivation. Thus, caspase-12 mediates an ER-specific apoptosis pathway and may contribute to amyloid-beta neurotoxicity."], ["Identification of bacteria-derived HLA-bound peptides in melanoma", "A variety of species of bacteria are known to colonize human tumours(1-11), proliferate within them and modulate immune function, which ultimately affects the survival of patients with cancer and their responses to treatment(12-14). However, it is not known whether antigens derived from intracellular bacteria are presented by the human leukocyte antigen class I and II (HLA-I and HLA-II, respectively) molecules of tumour cells, or whether such antigens elicit a tumour-infiltrating T cell immune response. Here we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing and HLA peptidomics to identify a peptide repertoire derived from intracellular bacteria that was presented on HLA-I and HLA-II molecules in melanoma tumours. Our analysis of 17 melanoma metastases (derived from 9 patients) revealed 248 and 35 unique HLA-I and HLA-II peptides, respectively, that were derived from 41 species of bacteria. We identified recurrent bacterial peptides in tumours from different patients, as well as in different tumours from the same patient. Our study reveals that peptides derived from intracellular bacteria can be presented by tumour cells and elicit immune reactivity, and thus provides insight into a mechanism by which bacteria influence activation of the immune system and responses to therapy."], ["Engineering the third wave of biocatalysis", "Over the past ten years, scientific and technological advances have established biocatalysis as a practical and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional metallo- and organocatalysis in chemical synthesis, both in the laboratory and on an industrial scale.

Molecular interactions between chemical reactants and the catalytic surface control the activity and efficiency, and hence need to be optimized; however, generalized experimental strategies to do so are scarce. Here we show how lattice strain can be used experimentally to tune the catalytic activity of dealloyed bimetallic nanoparticles for the oxygen-reduction reaction, a key barrier to the application of fuel cells and metal\u2013air batteries. We demonstrate the core\u2013shell structure of the catalyst and clarify the mechanistic origin of its activity. The platinum-rich shell exhibits compressive strain, which results in a shift of the electronic band structure of platinum and weakening chemisorption of oxygenated species.

Perceived by a small family of F-box proteins including transport inhibitor response 1 (TIR1), auxin regulates gene expression by promoting SCF ubiquitin-ligase-catalysed degradation of the Aux/IAA transcription repressors, but how the TIR1 F-box protein senses and becomes activated by auxin remains unclear. Here we present the crystal structures of the Arabidopsis TIR1 - ASK1 complex, free and in complexes with three different auxin compounds and an Aux/IAA substrate peptide. These structures show that the leucine-rich repeat domain of TIR1 contains an unexpected inositol hexakisphosphate co-factor and recognizes auxin and the Aux/IAA polypeptide substrate through a single surface pocket. Anchored to the base of the TIR1 pocket, auxin binds to a partially promiscuous site, which can also accommodate various auxin analogues. Docked on top of auxin, the Aux/IAA substrate peptide occupies the rest of the TIR1 pocket and completely encloses the hormone-binding site. By filling in a hydrophobic cavity at the protein interface, auxin enhances the TIR1 - substrate interactions by acting as a 'molecular glue'. Our results establish the first structural model of a plant hormone receptor."], ["Semiconducting non-molecular nitrogen up to 240 GPa and its low-pressure stability", "The triple bond of diatomic nitrogen has among the greatest binding energies of any molecule. At low temperatures and pressures, nitrogen forms a molecular crystal in which these strong bonds co-exist with weak van der Waals interactions between molecules, producing an insulator with a large band gap(1). As the pressure is raised on molecular crystals, intermolecular interactions increase and the molecules eventually dissociate to form monoatomic metallic solids, as was first predicted for hydrogen(2). Theory predicts that, in a pressure range between 50 and 94 GPa, diatomic nitrogen can be transformed into a non-molecular framework or polymeric structure with potential use as a high-energy-density material(3-5). Here we show that the non-molecular phase of nitrogen is semiconducting up to at least 240 GPa, at which pressure the energy gap has decreased to 0.4 eV. At 300 K, this transition from insulating to semiconducting behaviour starts at a pressure of approximately 140 GPa, but shifts to much higher pressure with decreasing temperature. The transition also exhibits remarkably large hysteresis with an equilibrium transition estimated to be near 100 GPa. Moreover, we have succeeded in recovering the non-molecular phase of nitrogen at ambient pressure (at temperatures below 100 K), which could be of importance for practical use."], ["Unlocking the potential of cation-disordered oxides for rechargeable lithium", "Nearly all high\u2013energy density cathodes for rechargeable lithium batteries are well-ordered materials in which lithium and other cations occupy distinct sites. Cation-disordered materials are generally disregarded as cathodes because lithium diffusion tends to be limited by their structures. The performance of Li1.211Mo0.467Cr0.3O2 shows that lithium diffusion can be facile in disordered materials. Using ab initio computations, we demonstrate that this unexpected behavior is due to percolation of a certain type of active diffusion channels in disordered Li-excess materials.

Although damming is known to affect riverborne nutrient loads, and thus riverine ecosystems, evidence for significant effects in open coastal waters is sparse(4-6). Here we present long-term data sets of water and nutrient discharge from the River Danube to the Black Sea. These data reveal a reduction in the dissolved silicate load of the river by about two-thirds since dam constructions in the early 1970s. A concomitant decrease in wintertime dissolved silicate concentrations by more than 60% was observed in central Black Sea surface waters. The consequent changes in silicon to nitrogen ratio of the Black Sea nutrient load appear to be larger than those caused by eutrophication alone, and seem to be responsible for dramatic shifts in phytoplankton species composition from diatoms (siliceous) to coccolithophores and flagellates (non-siliceous). Our results strongly suggest that the damming of the Danube has been instrumental in causing the observed changes in Black Sea surface waters(3,7-9), and that the large number of dams in operation around the world today could similarly affect the food web structure and biogeochemical cycling in coastal seas."], ["Quantum entanglement between an optical photon and a solid-state spin qubit", "Quantum entanglement is among the most fascinating aspects of quantum theory(1). Entangled optical photons are now widely used for fundamental tests of quantum mechanics(2) and applications such as quantum cryptography(1). Several recent experiments demonstrated entanglement of optical photons with trapped ions(3), atoms(4,5) and atomic ensembles(6-8), which are then used to connect remote long-term memory nodes in distributed quantum networks(9-11). Here we realize quantum entanglement between the polarization of a single optical photon and a solid-state qubit associated with the single electronic spin of a nitrogen vacancy centre in diamond. Our experimental entanglement verification uses the quantum eraser technique(5,12), and demonstrates that a high degree of control over interactions between a solid-state qubit and the quantum light field can be achieved. The reported entanglement source can be used in studies of fundamental quantum phenomena and provides a key building block for the solid-state realization of quantum optical networks(13,14)."], ["Mapping molecular motions leading to charge delocalization with ultrabright electrons", "Ultrafast processes can now be studied with the combined atomic spatial resolution of diffraction methods and the temporal resolution of femtosecond optical spectroscopy by using femtosecond pulses of electrons(1-14) or hard X-rays(15-19) as structural probes. However, it is challenging to apply these methods to organic materials, which have weak scattering centres, thermal lability, and poor heat conduction. These characteristics mean that the source needs to be extremely bright to enable us to obtain high-quality diffraction data before cumulative heating effects from the laser excitation either degrade the sample or mask the structural dynamics(20). Here we show that a recently developed, ultrabright femtosecond electron source(7-9) makes it possible to monitor the molecular motions in the organic salt (EDO-TTF)(2)PF6 as it undergoes its photo-induced insulator-to-metal phase transition(21-24). After the ultrafast laser excitation, we record time-delayed diffraction patterns that allow us to identify hundreds of Bragg reflections with which to map the structural evolution of the system. The data and supporting model calculations indicate the formation of a transient intermediate structure in the early stage of charge delocalization (less than five picoseconds), and reveal that the molecular motions driving its formation are distinct from those that, assisted by thermal relaxation, convert the system into a metallic state on the hundred-picosecond timescale.

However, their performance is still not up to par with their potential because of the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction. Here we report a single-atom catalyst design that transforms the sluggish four-electron oxygen reduction reaction into a fast two-electron pathway and enables a zinc peroxide (ZnO2) chemistry in ZABs. With accessible FeN2S2 active sites on mesoporous graphene, the catalyst serves to promote transport of electrolyte, oxygen and electron and confines the growth of ZnO2, which would otherwise form dead products. As a result, as-fabricated ZAB in a neutral electrolyte shows a voltage as high as 1.2\u2009V at 0.2\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122, a high round-trip efficiency of 61% and an excellent operation stability beyond \u223c400\u2009h.

However, the charge neutrality of these systems presents an apparent limitation-a wide range of intriguing phenomena arise from the Lorentz force for charged particles in a magnetic field, such as the fractional quantum Hall effect in two-dimensional electron systems(4,5). The limitation can be circumvented by exploiting the equivalence of the Lorentz force and the Coriolis force to create synthetic magnetic fields in rotating neutral systems. This was demonstrated by the appearance of quantized vortices in pioneering experiments(6-9) on rotating quantum gases, a hallmark of superfluids or superconductors in a magnetic field. However, because of technical issues limiting the maximum rotation velocity, the metastable nature of the rotating state and the difficulty of applying stable rotating optical lattices, rotational approaches are not able to reach the large fields required for quantum Hall physics(10-12). Here we experimentally realize an optically synthesized magnetic field for ultracold neutral atoms, which is evident from the appearance of vortices in our Bose-Einstein condensate. Our approach uses a spatially dependent optical coupling between internal states of the atoms, yielding a Berry's phase(13) sufficient to create large synthetic magnetic fields, and is not subject to the limitations of rotating systems. With a suitable lattice configuration, it should be possible to reach the quantum Hall regime, potentially enabling studies of topological quantum computation."], ["Synthesis, characterization, and recycling of bio-derivable polyester covalently adaptable networks for industrial composite applications", "Fiber-reinforced polymers (FRPs) are critical for energy-relevant applications such as wind turbine blades.

The PIK3CA-AKT-mTOR pathway is one of the most commonly activated pathways in human cancers(1), which has led to the development of small-molecule inhibitors that target various nodes in the pathway. Among these agents, first-generation mTOR inhibitors (rapalogs) have caused responses in 'N-of-1' cases, and second-generation mTOR kinase inhibitors (TORKi) are currently in clinical trials(2-4). Here we sought to delineate the likely resistance mechanisms to existing mTOR inhibitors in human cell lines, as a guide for next-generation therapies. The mechanism of resistance to the TORKi was unusual in that intrinsic kinase activity of mTOR was increased, rather than a direct active-site mutation interfering with drug binding. Indeed, identical drug-resistant mutations have been also identified in drug-naive patients, suggesting that tumours with activating MTOR mutations will be intrinsically resistant to second-generation mTOR inhibitors. We report the development of a new class of mTOR inhibitors that overcomes resistance to existing first-and second-generation inhibitors. The third-generation mTOR inhibitor exploits the unique juxtaposition of two drug-binding pockets to create a bivalent interaction that allows inhibition of these resistant mutants."], ["High-strength scalable MXene films through bridging-induced densification", "MXenes are a growing family of two-dimensional transition metal carbides and/or nitrides that are densely stacked into macroscopically layered films and have been considered for applications such as flexible electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials.

The nature of the X-E bonding has been analyzed with charge- and energy-partitioning methods. The calculations show that the linear isomers of the nitrogen systems lin-HEN and lin-HNE are minima on the singlet PES. The carbon compound lin-HCN (HCN=hydrogen cyanide) is 14.9 kcal mol(-1) lower in energy than lin-HNC but the heavier group 14 homologues lin-HEN (E=Si-Pb) are between 64.8 and 71.5 kcal mol(-1) less stable than the lin-HNE isomers. The phosphorous system (H, P, E) exhibits significant differences concerning the geometry and stability of the equilibrium structures compared with the nitrogen system. The linear form lin-HEP of the former system is much more stable than lin-HPE. The molecule lin-HCP is the only minimum on the singlet PES. It is 78.5 kcal mol(-1) lower in energy than lin-HPC, which is a second-order saddle point. The heavier homologues lin-HPE, in which E=Si-Pb, are also second-order saddle points, whereas the bent-HPE structures are the global minima on the PES. They are between 10.3 (E=Si) and 36.5 kcal mol(-1) (E=Pb) lower in energy than lin-HEP. The bent-HPE structures possess rather acute bending angles H-P-E between 60.1 (E=Si) and 79.7\u00b0 (E=Pb). The energy differences between the heavier group 15 isomers lin-HEX (X=P-Bi) and the bent structures bent-HXE become continuously smaller. The silicon species lin-HSiBi is even 3.1 kcal mol(-1) lower in energy than bent-HBiSi. The bending angle H-X-E becomes more acute when X becomes heavier. The drastic energy differences between the isomers of the system (H, X, E) are explained with three factors that determine the relative stabilities of the energy minima: 1) The different bond strength between the hydrogen bonds H-X and H-E. 2) The electronic excitation energy of the fragment HE from the X (2)\u03a0 ground state to the (4)\u03a3(-) excited state, which is required to establish a E\u2261X triple bond in the molecules lin-HEX. 3) The strength of the intrinsic X-E interactions in the molecules. The trends of the geometries and relative energies of the linear, bent, and cyclic isomers are explained with an energy-decomposition analysis that provides deep insight into the nature of the bonding situation."], ["Time-crystalline eigenstate order on a quantum processor", "Quantum many-body systems display rich phase structure in their low-temperature equilibrium states(1). However, much of nature is not in thermal equilibrium. Remarkably, it was recently predicted that out-of-equilibrium systems can exhibit novel dynamical phases(2-8) that may otherwise be forbidden by equilibrium thermodynamics, a paradigmatic example being the discrete time crystal (DTC)(7,9-15). Concretely, dynamical phases can be defined in periodically driven many-body-localized (MBL) systems via the concept of eigenstate order(7,16,17). In eigenstate-ordered MBL phases, the entire many-body spectrum exhibits quantum correlations and long-range order, with characteristic signatures in late-time dynamics from all initial states. It is, however, challenging to experimentally distinguish such stable phases from transient phenomena, or from regimes in which the dynamics of a few select states can mask typical behaviour. Here we implement tunable controlled-phase (CPHASE) gates on an array of superconducting qubits to experimentally observe an MBL-DTC and demonstrate its characteristic spatiotemporal response for generic initial states(7,9,10). Our work employs a time-reversal protocol to quantify the impact of external decoherence, and leverages quantum typicality to circumvent the exponential cost of densely sampling the eigenspectrum. Furthermore, we locate the phase transition out of the DTC with an experimental finite-size analysis. These results establish a scalable approach to studying non-equilibrium phases of matter on quantum processors."], ["Bayesian reaction optimization as a tool for chemical synthesis", "Reaction optimization is fundamental to synthetic chemistry, from optimizing the yield of industrial processes to selecting conditions for the preparation of medicinal candidates1. Likewise, parameter optimization is omnipresent in artificial intelligence, from tuning virtual personal assistants to training social media and product recommendation systems2. Owing to the high cost associated with carrying out experiments, scientists in both areas set numerous (hyper)parameter values by evaluating only a small subset of the possible configurations. Bayesian optimization, an iterative response surface-based global optimization algorithm, has demonstrated exceptional performance in the tuning of machine learning models3. Bayesian optimization has also been recently applied in chemistry4,5,6,7,8,9; however, its application and assessment for reaction optimization in synthetic chemistry has not been investigated. Here we report the development of a framework for Bayesian reaction optimization and an open-source software tool that allows chemists to easily integrate state-of-the-art optimization algorithms into their everyday laboratory practices. We collect a large benchmark dataset for a palladium-catalysed direct arylation reaction, perform a systematic study of Bayesian optimization compared to human decision-making in reaction optimization, and apply Bayesian optimization to two real-world optimization efforts (Mitsunobu and deoxyfluorination reactions). Benchmarking is accomplished via an online game that links the decisions made by expert chemists and engineers to real experiments run in the laboratory. Our findings demonstrate that Bayesian optimization outperforms human decisionmaking in both average optimization efficiency (number of experiments) and consistency (variance of outcome against initially available data). Overall, our studies suggest that adopting Bayesian optimization methods into everyday laboratory practices could facilitate more efficient synthesis of functional chemicals by enabling better-informed, data-driven decisions about which experiments to run."], ["Observation of coupled magnetic and electric domains", "Ferroelectromagnets are an interesting group of compounds that complement purely (anti-)ferroelectric or (anti-)ferromagnetic materials-they display simultaneous electric and magnetic order(1-3). With this coexistence they supplement materials in which magnetization can be induced by an electric field and electrical polarization by a magnetic field, a property which is termed the magnetoelectric effect(4). Aside from its fundamental importance, the mutual control of electric and magnetic properties is of significant interest for applications in magnetic storage media and 'spintronics'(2,3). The coupled electric and magnetic ordering in ferroelectromagnets is accompanied by the formation of domains and domain walls. However, such a cross-correlation between magnetic and electric domains has so far not been observed. Here we report spatial maps of coupled antiferromagnetic and ferroelectric domains in YMnO(3), obtained by imaging with optical second harmonic generation. The coupling originates from an interaction between magnetic and electric domain walls, which leads to a configuration that is dominated by the ferroelectromagnetic product of the order parameters."], ["Resonant domain-wall-enhanced tunable microwave ferroelectrics", "Ordering of ferroelectric polarization(1) and its trajectory in response to an electric field(2) are essential for the operation of non-volatile memories(3), transducers(4) and electro-optic devices(5). However, for voltage control of capacitance and frequency agility in telecommunication devices, domain walls have long been thought to be a hindrance because they lead to high dielectric loss and hysteresis in the device response to an applied electric field(6). To avoid these effects, tunable dielectrics are often operated under piezoelectric resonance conditions, relying on operation well above the ferroelectric Curie temperature(7), where tunability is compromised. Therefore, there is an unavoidable trade-off between the requirements of high tunability and low loss in tunable dielectric devices, which leads to severe limitations on their figure of merit. Here we show that domain structure can in fact be exploited to obtain ultralow loss and exceptional frequency selectivity without piezoelectric resonance. We use intrinsically tunable materials with properties that are defined not only by their chemical composition, but also by the proximity and accessibility of thermodynamically predicted strain-induced, ferroelectric domain-wall variants(8). The resulting gigahertz microwave tunability and dielectric loss are better than those of the best film devices by one to two orders of magnitude and comparable to those of bulk single crystals. The measured quality factors exceed the theoretically predicted zerofield intrinsic limit owing to domain-wall fluctuations, rather than field-induced piezoelectric oscillations, which are usually associated with resonance. Resonant frequency tuning across the entire L, S and C microwave bands (1-8 gigahertz) is achieved in an individual device-a range about 100 times larger than that of the best intrinsically tunable material. These results point to a rich phase space of possible nanometre-scale domain structures that can be used to surmount current limitations, and demonstrate a promising strategy for obtaining ultrahigh frequency agility and low-loss microwave devices."], ["High-temperature superconductivity in monolayer Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>CaCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8+\u03b4</sub>", "Although copper oxide high-temperature superconductors constitute a complex and diverse material family, they all share a layered lattice structure. This curious fact prompts the question of whether high-temperature superconductivity can exist in an isolated monolayer of copper oxide, and if so, whether the two-dimensional superconductivity and various related phenomena differ from those of their three-dimensional counterparts. The answers may provide insights into the role of dimensionality in high-temperature superconductivity. Here we develop a fabrication process that obtains intrinsic monolayer crystals of the high-temperature superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta (Bi-2212; here, a monolayer refers to a half unit cell that contains two CuO2 planes). The highest superconducting transition temperature of the monolayer is as high as that of optimally doped bulk. The lack of dimensionality effect on the transition temperature defies expectations from the Mermin-Wagner theorem, in contrast to the much-reduced transition temperature in conventional two-dimensional superconductors such as NbSe2. The properties of monolayer Bi-2212 become extremely tunable; our survey of superconductivity, the pseudogap, charge order and the Mott state at various doping concentrations reveals that the phases are indistinguishable from those in the bulk. Monolayer Bi-2212 therefore displays all the fundamental physics of high-temperature superconductivity. Our results establish monolayer copper oxides as a platform for studying high-temperature superconductivity and other strongly correlated phenomena in two dimensions."], ["Psl trails guide exploration and microcolony formation in <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> biofilms", "Bacterial biofilms are surface-associated, multicellular, morphologically complex microbial communities(1-7). Biofilm-forming bacteria such as the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa are phenotypically distinct from their free-swimming, planktonic counterparts(7-10). Much work has focused on factors affecting surface adhesion, and it is known that P. aeruginosa secretes the Psl exopolysaccharide, which promotes surface attachment by acting as 'molecular glue'(11-15). However, how individual surface-attached bacteria self-organize into microcolonies, the first step in communal biofilm organization, is not well understood. Here we identify a new role for Psl in early biofilm development using a massively parallel cell-tracking algorithm to extract the motility history of every cell on a newly colonized surface(16). By combining this technique with fluorescent Psl staining and computer simulations, we show that P. aeruginosa deposits a trail of Psl as it moves on a surface, which influences the surface motility of subsequent cells that encounter these trails and thus generates positive feedback. Both experiments and simulations indicate that the web of secreted Psl controls the distribution of surface visit frequencies, which can be approximated by a power law. This Pareto-type(17) behaviour indicates that the bacterial community self-organizes in a manner analogous to a capitalist economic system(18), a 'rich-get-richer' mechanism of Psl accumulation that results in a small number of 'elite' cells becoming extremely enriched in communally produced Psl. Using engineered strains with inducible Psl production, we show that local Psl concentrations determine post-division cell fates and that high local Psl concentrations ultimately allow elite cells to serve as the founding population for initial microcolony development."], ["Coordinating Ability of Anions, Solvents, Amino Acids, and Gases towards Alkaline and Alkaline-Earth Elements, Transition Metals, and Lanthanides", "After briefly reviewing the applications of the coordination ability indices proposed earlier for anions and solvents toward transition metals and lanthanides, a new analysis of crystal structures is applied now to a much larger number of coordinating species: anions (including those that are present in ionic solvents), solvents, amino acids, gases, and a sample of neutral ligands. The coordinating ability towards s-block elements is now also considered. The effect of several factors on the coordinating ability will be discussed: (a)\u2005the charge of an anion, (b)\u2005the chelating nature of anions and solvents, (c)\u2005the degree of protonation of oxo-anions, carboxylates and amino carboxylates, and (d)\u2005the substitution of hydrogen atoms by methyl groups in NH3, ethylenediamine, benzene, ethylene, pyridine and aldehydes.

The complexes avoided typical side reactions in CEL couplings, and an excess of boronic acid was not required. Water was tolerated, and addition of neither base nor other additives was necessary. Primary amines, acyclic and cyclic secondary amines, anilines, aminophenol, imidazole, pyrazole, and phenyltetrazole can be quantitatively arylated at either 25 or 50 \u00b0C with 2.5 mol % of the catalyst. Reaction kinetics were investigated in detail. Kinetic and spectroscopic studies provide evidence for the formation of unproductive copper\u2013substrate complexes. Formation of an aniline\u2013phenylboronic acid adduct was responsible for the zero-order dependence of reaction rates on phenylboronic acid concentration. Kinetic evidence indicates that the order of reaction steps is transmetalation, nucleophile coordination, and oxidation. Couplings performed poorly with electron-deficient arylboronic acids, due to a slower Cu(II)/Cu(III) oxidation in the catalytic cycle. Photoredox catalysis partially resolved this problem, but addition of copper acetate as an external oxidant proved to be more efficient."], ["High tensile ductility in a nanostructured metal", "Nanocrystalline metals-with grain sizes of less than 100 nm-have strengths exceeding those of coarse-grained and even alloyed metals(1,2), and are thus expected to have many applications. For example, pure nanocrystalline Cu (refs 1-7) has a yield strength in excess of 400 MPa, which is six times higher than that of coarse-grained Cu. But nanocrystalline materials often exhibit low tensile ductility at room temperature, which limits their practical utility. The elongation to failure is typically less than a few per cent; the regime of uniform deformation is even smaller(1-7). Here we describe a thermomechanical treatment of Cu that results in a bimodal grain size distribution, with micrometre-sized grains embedded inside a matrix of nanocrystalline and ultrafine (<300 nm) grains. The matrix grains impart high strength, as expected from an extrapolation of the Hall-Petch relationship. Meanwhile, the inhomogeneous microstructure induces strain hardening mechanisms(8-11) that stabilize the tensile deformation, leading to a high tensile ductility-65% elongation to failure, and 30% uniform elongation. We expect that these results will have implications in the development of tough nanostructured metals for forming operations and high-performance structural applications including microelectromechanical and biomedical systems."], ["Superconductivity in the non-oxide perovskite MgCNi<sub>3</sub>", "The interplay of magnetic interactions, the dimensionality of the crystal structure and electronic correlations in producing superconductivity is one of the dominant themes in the study of the electronic properties of complex materials. Although magnetic interactions and two-dimensional structures were long thought to be detrimental to the formation of a superconducting state, they are actually common features of both the high transition-temperature (T-c) copper oxides and low-T-c material Sr2RuO4, where they appear to be essential contributors to the exotic electronic states of these materials(1). Here we report that the perovskite-structured compound MgCNi3 is superconducting with a critical temperature of 8 K. This material is the three-dimensional analogue of the LnNi(2)B(2)C family of superconductors, which have critical temperatures up to 16 K (ref. 2). The itinerant electrons in both families of materials arise from the partial filling of the nickel d-states, which generally leads to ferromagnetism as is the case in metallic Ni. The high relative proportion of Ni in MgCNi3 suggests that magnetic interactions are important, and the lower T-c of this three-dimensional compound-when compared to the LnNi(2)B(2)C family-contrasts with conventional ideas regarding the origins of superconductivity."], ["Chimeric peptidomimetic antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria", "There is an urgent need for new antibiotics against Gram-negative pathogens that are resistant to carbapenem and third-generation cephalosporins, against which antibiotics of last resort have lost most of their efficacy.

These chimeric antibiotics contain a beta-hairpin peptide macrocycle linked to the macrocycle found in the polymyxin and colistin family of natural products. They are bactericidal and have a mechanism of action that involves binding to both lipopolysaccharide and the main component (BamA) of the beta-barrel folding complex (BAM) that is required for the folding and insertion of beta-barrel proteins into the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Extensively optimized derivatives show potent activity against multidrug-resistant pathogens, including all of the Gram-negative members of the ESKAPE pathogens(1). These derivatives also show favourable drug properties and overcome colistin resistance, both in vitro and in vivo. The lead candidate is currently in preclinical toxicology studies that-if successful-will allow progress into clinical studies that have the potential to address life-threatening infections by the Gram-negative pathogens, and thus to resolve a considerable unmet medical need."], ["Structural insights into \u03bc-opioid receptor activation", "Activation of the mu-opioid receptor (mu OR) is responsible for the efficacy of the most effective analgesics. To shed light on the structural basis for mu OR activation, here we report a 2.1 angstrom X-ray crystal structure of the murine mu OR bound to the morphinan agonist BU72 and a G protein mimetic camelid antibody fragment. The BU72-stabilized changes in the mu OR binding pocket are subtle and differ from those observed for agonist-bound structures of the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (beta(2)AR) and the M2 muscarinic receptor. Comparison with active beta(2)AR reveals a common rearrangement in the packing of three conserved amino acids in the core of the mu OR, and molecular dynamics simulations illustrate how the ligand-binding pocket is conformationally linked to this conserved triad. Additionally, an extensive polar network between the ligand-binding pocket and the cytoplasmic domains appears to play a similar role in signal propagation for all three G-protein-coupled receptors."], ["Toughening Elastomers with Sacrificial Bonds and Watching Them Break", "Elastomers are widely used because of their large-strain reversible deformability. Most unfilled elastomers suffer from a poor mechanical strength, which limits their use. Using sacrificial bonds, we show how brittle, unfilled elastomers can be strongly reinforced in stiffness and toughness (up to 4 megapascals and 9 kilojoules per square meter) by introducing a variable proportion of isotropically prestretched chains that can break and dissipate energy before the material fails. Chemoluminescent cross-linking molecules, which emit light as they break, map in real time where and when many of these internal bonds break ahead of a propagating crack. The simple methodology that we use to introduce sacrificial bonds, combined with the mapping of where bonds break, has the potential to stimulate the development of new classes of unfilled tough elastomers and better molecular models of the fracture of soft materials."], ["Structural basis for the function and inhibition of an influenza virus proton channel", "The M2 protein from influenza A virus is a pH- activated proton channel that mediates acidification of the interior of viral particles entrapped in endosomes. M2 is the target of the anti- influenza drugs amantadine and rimantadine; recently, resistance to these drugs in humans, birds and pigs has reached more than 90% ( ref. 1). Here we describe the crystal structure of the transmembrane- spanning region of the homotetrameric protein in the presence and absence of the channel- blocking drug amantadine. pH- dependent structural changes occur near a set of conserved His and Trp residues that are involved in proton gating(2). The drug- binding site is lined by residues that are mutated in amantadine- resistant viruses(3,4). Binding of amantadine physically occludes the pore, and might also perturb the pK(a) of the critical His residue. The structure provides a starting point for solving the problem of resistance to M2- channel blockers."], ["NANOTRIBOLOGY - FRICTION, WEAR AND LUBRICATION AT THE ATOMIC-SCALE", "Friction, wear and lubrication between materials In contact are of fundamental importance in many pure and applied sciences.

Implicit in the supramolecular description of a crystal structure is the fact that molecules in a crystal are held together by noncovalent interactions. The need for rational approaches towards solid-state structures of fundamental and practical importance has led to the emergence of crystal engineering, which seeks to understand intermolecular interactions and recognition phenomena in the context of crystal packing. The aim of crystal engineering is to establish reliable connections between molecular and supramolecular structure on the basis of intermolecular interactions. Ideally one would like to identify substructural units in a target supermolecule that can be assembled from logically chosen precursor molecules. Indeed, crystal engineering is a new organic synthesis, and the aim of this article is to show that rather than being only nominally relevant to organic chemistry, this subject is well within the mainstream, being surprisingly similar to traditional organic synthesis in concept. The details vary because one is dealing here with intermolecular interactions rather than with covalent bonds; so this article is divided into two parts. The first is concerned with strategy, highlighting the conceptual relationship between crystal engineering and organic synthesis and introduces the term supramolecular synthon. The second part emphasizes methodology, that is, the chemical and geometrical properties of specific intermolecular interactions."], ["Peptoid nanosheets exhibit a new secondary-structure motif", "A promising route to the synthesis of protein-mimetic materials that are capable of complex functions, such as molecular recognition and catalysis, is provided by sequence-defined peptoid polymers(1,2)-structural relatives of biologically occurring polypeptides. Peptoids, which are relatively non-toxic and resistant to degradation3, can fold into defined structures through a combination of sequence-dependent interactions(3-8). However, the range of possible structures that are accessible to peptoids and other biological mimetics is unknown, and our ability to design protein-like architectures from these polymer classes is limited(9). Here we use molecular-dynamics simulations, together with scattering and microscopy data, to determine the atomic-resolution structure of the recently discovered peptoid nanosheet, an ordered supramolecular assembly that extends macroscopically in only two dimensions. Our simulations show that nanosheets are structurally and dynamically heterogeneous, can be formed only from peptoids of certain lengths, and are potentially porous to water and ions. Moreover, their formation is enabled by the peptoids' adoption of a secondary structure that is not seen in the natural world. This structure, a zigzag pattern that we call a Sigma('sigma')-strand, results from the ability of adjacent backbone monomers to adopt opposed rotational states, thereby allowing the backbone to remain linear and untwisted. Linear backbones tiled in a brick-like way form an extended two-dimensional nanostructure, the Sigma-sheet. The binary rotational-statemotif of the Sigma-strand is not seen in regular protein structures, which are usually built from one type of rotational state. We also show that the concept of building regular structures from multiple rotational states can be generalized beyond the peptoid nanosheet system."], ["Photon-induced near-field electron microscopy", "In materials science and biology, optical near-field microscopies enable spatial resolutions beyond the diffraction limit(1,2), but they cannot provide the atomic-scale imaging capabilities of electron microscopy(3). Given the nature of interactions(4-8) between electrons and photons, and considering their connections(9,10) through nanostructures, it should be possible to achieve imaging of evanescent electromagnetic fields with electron pulses when such fields are resolved in both space (nanometre and below) and time (femtosecond) (11-13). Here we report the development of photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM), and the associated phenomena. We show that the precise spatiotemporal overlap of femtosecond single-electron packets with intense optical pulses at a nanostructure (individual carbon nanotube or silver nanowire in this instance) results in the direct absorption of integer multiples of photon quanta (nh omega) by the relativistic electrons accelerated to 200 keV. By energy-filtering only those electrons resulting from this absorption, it is possible to image directly in space the near-field electric field distribution, obtain the temporal behaviour of the field on the femtosecond timescale, and map its spatial polarization dependence. We believe that the observation of the photon-induced near-field effect in ultrafast electron microscopy demonstrates the potential for many applications, including those of direct space-time imaging of localized fields at interfaces and visualization of phenomena related to photonics, plasmonics and nanostructures."], ["Formation of a Supramolecular Polymeric Adhesive via Water-Participant Hydrogen Bond Formation", "A supramolecular polymeric adhesive was prepared from non-viscous, non-polymeric materials by water\u2013participant hydrogen bonds.

The dependence of the formation rate constant of the oxygen adduct on reactant concentrations reveals a rate law that is first order in Mn porphyrin and oxygen substrate. A second order dependence in HA is observed for unadorned Mn porphyrin platforms whereas with Mn hangman porphyrin, a proton is provided intramolecular to the oxygen adduct and consequently the HA order is reduced to unity.

It enables heritable gene repression, maintains chromosome integrity and provides mechanical rigidity to the nucleus(1,2). These diverse functions are proposed to arise in part from compaction of the underlying chromatin(2). A major type of heterochromatin contains at its core the complex formed between HP1 proteins and chromatin that is methylated on histone H3, lysine 9 (H3K9me). HP1 is proposed to use oligomerization to compact chromatin into phase-separated condensates(3-6). Yet, how HP1-mediated phase separation relates to chromatin compaction remains unclear. Here we show that chromatin compaction by the Schizosaccharomyces pombe HP1 protein Swi6 results in phase-separated liquid condensates. Unexpectedly, we find that Swi6 substantially increases the accessibility and dynamics of buried histone residues within a nucleosome. Restraining these dynamics impairs compaction of chromatin into liquid droplets by Swi6. Our results indicate that Swi6 couples its oligomerization to the phase separation of chromatin by a counterintuitive mechanism, namely the dynamic exposure of buried nucleosomal regions. We propose that such reshaping of the octamer core by Swi6 increases opportunities for multivalent interactions between nucleosomes, thereby promoting phase separation. This mechanism may more generally drive chromatin organization beyond heterochromatin."], ["Nanoparticle biointerfacing by platelet membrane cloaking", "Development of functional nanoparticles can be encumbered by unanticipated material properties and biological events, which can affect nanoparticle effectiveness in complex, physiologically relevant systems(1-3).

The resulting nanoparticles possess a right-side-out unilamellar membrane coating functionalized with immunomodulatory and adhesion antigens associated with platelets. Compared to uncoated particles, the platelet membrane-cloaked nanoparticles have reduced cellular uptake by macrophage-like cells and lack particle-induced complement activation in autologous human plasma. The cloaked nanoparticles also display platelet-mimicking properties such as selective adhesion to damaged human and rodent vasculatures as well as enhanced binding to platelet-adhering pathogens. In an experimental rat model of coronary restenosis and a mouse model of systemic bacterial infection, docetaxel and vancomycin, respectively, show enhanced therapeutic efficacy when delivered by the platelet-mimetic nanoparticles.

However, this cycling is constrained by viruses that affect community composition, metabolic activity, and evolutionary trajectories(2,3). Owing to challenges with the sampling and cultivation of viruses, genome-level viral diversity remains poorly described and grossly understudied, with less than 1% of observed surface-ocean viruses known(4). Here we assemble complete genomes and large genomic fragments from both surface-and deep-ocean viruses sampled during the Tara Oceans and Malaspina research expeditions(5,6), and analyse the resulting 'global ocean virome' dataset to present a global map of abundant, double-stranded DNA viruses complete with genomic and ecological contexts. A total of 15,222 epipelagic and mesopelagic viral populations were identified, comprising 867 viral clusters (defined as approximately genus-level groups(7,8)). This roughly triples the number of known ocean viral populations(4) and doubles the number of candidate bacterial and archaeal virus genera(8), providing a near-complete sampling of epipelagic communities at both the population and viral-cluster level. We found that 38 of the 867 viral clusters were locally or globally abundant, together accounting for nearly half of the viral populations in any global ocean virome sample. While two-thirds of these clusters represent newly described viruses lacking any cultivated representative, most could be computationally linked to dominant, ecologically relevant microbial hosts. Moreover, we identified 243 viral-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes, of which only 95 were previously known. Deeper analyses of four of these auxiliary metabolic genes (dsrC, soxYZ, P-II (also known as glnB) and amoC) revealed that abundant viruses may directly manipulate sulfur and nitrogen cycling throughout the epipelagic ocean.

However, it remains difficult to rationally exploit non-covalent interactions for the formation of chiral assemblies that are stable in water, where solvent molecules can compete effectively for hydrogen bonds. Here we describe a general strategy for the design of functionalized monomer units and their association in either water or alkanes into non-covalently linked polymeric structures with controlled helicity and chain length. The monomers consist of bifunctionalized ureidotriazine units connected by a spacer and carrying solubilizing chains at the periphery. This design allows for dimerization through self-complementary quadruple hydrogen bonding between the units and solvophobically induced stacking of the dimers into columnar polymeric architectures, whose structure and helicity can be adjusted by tuning the nature of the solubilizing side chains."], ["Loss-free and active optical negative-index metamaterials", "The recently emerged fields of metamaterials and transformation optics promise a family of exciting applications such as invisibility, optical imaging with deeply subwavelength resolution and nanophotonics with the potential for much faster information processing. The possibility of creating optical negative-index metamaterials (NIMs) using nanostructured metal-dielectric composites has triggered intense basic and applied research over the past several years(1-10). However, the performance of all NIM applications is significantly limited by the inherent and strong energy dissipation in metals, especially in the near-infrared and visible wavelength ranges(11,12). Generally the losses are orders of magnitude too large for the proposed applications, and the reduction of losses with optimized designs seems to be out of reach. One way of addressing this issue is to incorporate gain media into NIM designs(13-16). However, whether NIMs with low loss can be achieved has been the subject of theoretical debate(17,18). Here we experimentally demonstrate that the incorporation of gain material in the high-local-field areas of a metamaterial makes it possible to fabricate an extremely low-loss and active optical NIM. The original loss-limited negative refractive index and the figure of merit (FOM) of the device have been drastically improved with loss compensation in the visible wavelength range between 722 and 738 nm. In this range, the NIM becomes active such that the sum of the light intensities in transmission and reflection exceeds the intensity of the incident beam. At a wavelength of 737 nm, the negative refractive index improves from -0.66 to -1.017 and the FOM increases from 1 to 26. At 738 nm, the FOM is expected to become macroscopically large, of the order of 10(6). This study demonstrates the possibility of fabricating an optical negative-index metamaterial that is not limited by the inherent loss in its metal constituent."], ["Cu(ii/i) redox couples: potential alternatives to traditional electrolytes for dye-sensitized solar cells", "The redox shuttle is one of the essential ingredients in dye-sensitized solar cell devices. Though the I\u2212/I3\u2212 redox couple has dominated in the last couple of decades, however, due to the loss of open-circuit potential, complementary absorption with a sensitizer and the volatile nature restricts the module development. Metal complexes with variable oxidation states are probable alternative candidates as redox shuttles due to the change in their redox potentials with varying ligands in order to suit different sensitizers. Co(III/II) redox couples using polypyridyl ligands have been widely used in DSSC and have crossed the device efficiency of 14%. However, mass transport constraints and health hazards exist due to the commercialization of technology. Inspired from biological electron transfer reactions, Cu(II/I) redox shuttles have gained much attention as redox couples for DSSC applications in recent years. Particularly in low light conditions, it minimizes mass transport, has a device efficiency greater than 32%, and has potential in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. In this review, recent advancements in the use of Cu(II/I) redox shuttles using polypyridyl ligands for DSSC applications are presented."], ["Chemical remodelling of cell surfaces in living animals", "Cell surfaces are endowed with biological functionality designed to mediate extracellular communication. The cell-surface repertoire can be expanded to include abiotic functionality through the biosynthetic introduction of unnatural sugars into cellular glycans, a process termed metabolic oligosaccharide engineering(1,2). This technique has been exploited in fundamental studies of glycan-dependent cell-cell and virus-cell interactions(3-5) and also provides an avenue for the chemical remodelling of living cells(6-8). Unique chemical functional groups can be delivered to cell-surface glycans by metabolism of the corresponding unnatural precursor sugars. These functional groups can then undergo covalent reaction with exogenous agents bearing complementary functionality. The exquisite chemical selectivity required of this process is supplied by the Staudinger ligation of azides and phosphines, a reaction that has been performed on cultured cells without detriment to their physiology(7,9). Here we demonstrate that the Staudinger ligation can be executed in living animals, enabling the chemical modification of cells within their native environment. The ability to tag cell-surface glycans in vivo may enable therapeutic targeting and noninvasive imaging of changes in glycosylation during disease progression."], ["GaAs photovoltaics and optoelectronics using releasable multilayer epitaxial assemblies", "Compound semiconductors like gallium arsenide (GaAs) provide advantages over silicon for many applications, owing to their direct bandgaps and high electron mobilities. Examples range from efficient photovoltaic devices(1,2) to radio-frequency electronics(3,4) and most forms of optoelectronics(5,6). However, growing large, high quality wafers of these materials, and intimately integrating them on silicon or amorphous substrates (such as glass or plastic) is expensive, which restricts their use. Here we describe materials and fabrication concepts that address many of these challenges, through the use of films of GaAs or AlGaAs grown in thick, multilayer epitaxial assemblies, then separated from each other and distributed on foreign substrates by printing. This method yields large quantities of high quality semiconductor material capable of device integration in large area formats, in a manner that also allows the wafer to be reused for additional growths. We demonstrate some capabilities of this approach with three different applications: GaAs-based metal semiconductor field effect transistors and logic gates on plates of glass, near-infrared imaging devices on wafers of silicon, and photovoltaic modules on sheets of plastic. These results illustrate the implementation of compound semiconductors such as GaAs in applications whose cost structures, formats, area coverages or modes of use are incompatible with conventional growth or integration strategies."], ["Catalytic, Stereoselective Dihalogenation of Alkenes: Challenges and Opportunities", "Although recent years have witnessed significant advances in the development of catalytic, enantioselective halofunctionalizations of alkenes, the related dihalogenation of olefins to afford enantioenriched vicinal dihalide products remains comparatively underdeveloped. However, the growing number of complex natural products bearing halogen atoms at stereogenic centers has underscored this critical gap in the synthetic chemist\u2019s arsenal. This Review highlights the selectivity challenges inherent in the design of enantioselective dihalogenation processes, and formulates a mechanism-based classification of alkene dihalogenations, including those that may circumvent the \u201cclassical\u201d haliranium (or alkene-dihalogen \u03c0-complex) intermediates. A variety of metal and main group halide reagents that have been used for the dichlorination or dibromination of alkenes are discussed, and the proposed mechanisms of these transformations are critically evaluated."], ["The BAH domain of ORC1 links H4K20me2 to DNA replication licensing and Meier-Gorlin syndrome", "The recognition of distinctly modified histones by specialized 'effector' proteins constitutes a key mechanism for transducing molecular events at chromatin to biological outcomes(1). Effector proteins influence DNA-templated processes, including transcription, DNA recombination and DNA repair; however, no effector functions have yet been identified within the mammalian machinery that regulate DNA replication. Here we show that ORC1-a component of ORC (origin of replication complex), which mediates pre-DNA replication licensing(2)-contains a bromo adjacent homology (BAH) domain that specifically recognizes histone H4 dimethylated at lysine 20 (H4K20me2). Recognition of H4K20me2 is a property common to BAH domains present within diverse metazoan ORC1 proteins. Structural studies reveal that the specificity of the BAH domain for H4K20me2 is mediated by a dynamic aromatic dimethyl-lysine-binding cage and multiple intermolecular contacts involving the bound peptide. H4K20me2 is enriched at replication origins, and abrogating ORC1 recognition of H4K20me2 in cells impairs ORC1 occupancy at replication origins, ORC chromatin loading and cell-cycle progression. Mutation of the ORC1 BAH domain has been implicated in the aetiology of Meier-Gorlin syndrome (MGS)(3,4), a form of primordial dwarfism(5), and ORC1 depletion in zebrafish results in an MGS-like phenotype(4). We find that wild-type human ORC1, but not ORC1-H4K20me2-binding mutants, rescues the growth retardation of orc1 morphants. Moreover, zebrafish depleted of H4K20me2 have diminished body size, mirroring the phenotype of orc1 morphants. Together, our results identify the BAH domain as a novel methyl-lysine-binding module, thereby establishing the first direct link between histone methylation and the metazoan DNA replication machinery, and defining a pivotal aetiological role for the canonical H4K20me2 mark, via ORC1, in primordial dwarfism."], ["High-order superlattices by rolling up van der Waals heterostructures", "Two-dimensional (2D) materials(1,2) and the associated van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures(3-7) have provided great flexibility for integrating distinct atomic layers beyond the traditional limits of lattice-matching requirements, through layer-by-layer mechanical restacking or sequential synthesis. However, the 2D vdW heterostructures explored so far have been usually limited to relatively simple heterostructures with a small number of blocks(8-18). The preparation of high-order vdW superlattices with larger number of alternating units is exponentially more difficult, owing to the limited yield and material damage associated with each sequential restacking or synthesis step(8-29). Here we report a straightforward approach to realizing high-order vdW superlattices by rolling up vdW heterostructures. We show that a capillary-force-driven rolling-up process can be used to delaminate synthetic SnS2/WSe2 vdW heterostructures from the growth substrate and produce SnS2/WSe2 roll-ups with alternating monolayers of WSe2 and SnS2, thus forming high-order SnS2/WSe2 vdW superlattices. The formation of these superlattices modulates the electronic band structure and the dimensionality, resulting in a transition of the transport characteristics from semiconducting to metallic, from 2D to one-dimensional (1D), with an angle-dependent linear magnetoresistance. This strategy can be extended to create diverse 2D/2D vdW superlattices, more complex 2D/2D/2D vdW superlattices, and beyond-2D materials, including three-dimensional (3D) thin-film materials and 1D nanowires, to generate mixed-dimensional vdW superlattices, such as 3D/2D, 3D/2D/2D, 1D/2D and 1D/3D/2D vdW superlattices. This study demonstrates a general approach to producing high-order vdW superlattices with widely variable material compositions, dimensions, chirality and topology, and defines a rich material platform for both fundamental studies and technological applications."], ["Topological kagome magnets and superconductors", "A kagome lattice naturally features Dirac fermions, flat bands and van Hove singularities in its electronic structure. The Dirac fermions encode topology, flat bands favour correlated phenomena such as magnetism, and van Hove singularities can lead to instabilities towards long-range many-body orders, altogether allowing for the realization and discovery of a series of topological kagome magnets and superconductors with exotic properties. Recent progress in exploring kagome materials has revealed rich emergent phenomena resulting from the quantum interactions between geometry, topology, spin and correlation. Here we review these key developments in this field, starting from the fundamental concepts of a kagome lattice, to the realizations of Chern and Weyl topological magnetism, to various flat-band many-body correlations, and then to the puzzles of unconventional charge-density waves and superconductivity. We highlight the connection between theoretical ideas and experimental observations, and the bond between quantum interactions within kagome magnets and kagome superconductors, as well as their relation to the concepts in topological insulators, topological superconductors, Weyl semimetals and high-temperature superconductors. These developments broadly bridge topological quantum physics and correlated many-body physics in a wide range of bulk materials and substantially advance the frontier of topological quantum matter."], ["Fracture, fatigue, and friction of polymers in which entanglements greatly outnumber cross-links", "In gels and elastomers, the role of entanglements on deformation has been studied, but their effects on fracture, fatigue, and friction are less well understood. In this study, we synthesized polymers in which entanglements greatly outnumber cross-links. The dense entanglements enable transmission of tension in a polymer chain along its length and to many other chains. The sparse cross-links prevent the polymer chains from disentangling. These polymers have high toughness, strength, and fatigue resistance. After submersion in water, the polymers swell to equilibrium, and the resulting hydrogels have low hysteresis, low friction, and high wear resistance."], ["BRI1 is a critical component of a plasma-membrane receptor for plant steroids", "Most multicellular organisms use steroids as signalling molecules for physiological and developmental regulation. Two different modes of steroid action have been described in animal systems: the well-studied gene regulation response mediated by nuclear receptors(1,2), and the rapid non-genomic responses mediated by proposed membrane-bound receptors(3,4). Plant genomes do not seem to encode members of the nuclear receptor superfamily(5). However, a transmembrane receptor kinase, brassinosteroid-insensitive1 (BRI1), has been implicated in brassinosteroid-responses(6,7). Here we show that BRI1 functions as a receptor of brassinolide, the most active brassinosteroid. The number of brassinolide-binding sites and the degree of response to brassinolide depend on the level of BRI1 protein. The brassinolide-binding activity co-immunoprecipitates with BRI1, and requires a functional BRI1 extracellular domain. Moreover, treatment of Arabidopsis seedlings with brassinolide induces autophosphorylation of BRI1, which, together with our binding studies, shows that BRI1 is a receptor kinase that transduces steroid signals across the plasma membrane."], ["DNA-mediated nanoparticle crystallization into Wulff polyhedra", "Crystallization is a fundamental and ubiquitous process much studied over the centuries. But although the crystallization of atoms is fairly well understood(1,2), it remains challenging to predict reliably the outcome of molecular crystallization processes that are complicated by various molecular interactions and solvent involvement. This difficulty also applies to nanoparticles: high-quality three-dimensional crystals(3-6) are mostly produced using drying and sedimentation techniques that are often impossible to rationalize and control to give a desired crystal symmetry, lattice spacing and habit (crystal shape). In principle, DNA-mediated assembly of nanoparticles offers an ideal opportunity for studying nanoparticle crystallization(7-17): a well-defined set of rules have been developed to target desired lattice symmetries and lattice constants(8,9,18), and the occurrence of features such as grain boundaries and twinning in DNA superlattices and traditional crystals comprised of molecular or atomic building blocks suggests that similar principles govern their crystallization. But the presence of charged biomolecules, interparticle spacings of tens of nanometres, and the realization so far of only polycrystalline DNA-interconnected nanoparticle superlattices, all suggest that DNA-guided crystallization may differ from traditional crystal growth. Here we show that very slow cooling, over several days, of solutions of complementary-DNA-modified nanoparticles through the melting temperature of the system gives the thermodynamic product with a specific and uniform crystal habit. We find that our nanoparticle assemblies have the Wulff equilibrium crystal structure that is predicted from theoretical considerations and molecular dynamics simulations, thus establishing that DNA hybridization can direct nanoparticle assembly along a pathway that mimics atomic crystallization."], ["Polar metals by geometric design", "Gauss's law dictates that the net electric field inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is zero by effective charge screening; free carriers within a metal eliminate internal dipoles that may arise owing to asymmetric charge distributions(1). Quantum physics supports this view(2), demonstrating that delocalized electrons make a static macroscopic polarization, an ill-defined quantity in metals(3)-it is exceedingly unusual to find a polar metal that exhibits long-range ordered dipoles owing to cooperative atomic displacements aligned from dipolar interactions as in insulating phases(4). Here we describe the quantum mechanical design and experimental realization of room-temperature polar metals in thin-film ANiO(3) perovskite nickelates using a strategy based on atomic-scale control of inversion-preserving (centric) displacements(5). We predict with ab initio calculations that cooperative polar A cation displacements are geometrically stabilized with a non-equilibrium amplitude and tilt pattern of the corner-connected NiO6 octahedra-the structural signatures of perovskites-owing to geometric constraints imposed by the underlying substrate. Heteroepitaxial thin-films grown on LaAlO3 (111) substrates fulfil the design principles. We achieve both a conducting polar monoclinic oxide that is inaccessible in compositionally identical films grown on (001) substrates, and observe a hidden, previously unreported(6-10), non-equilibrium structure in thin-film geometries. We expect that the geometric stabilization approach will provide novel avenues for realizing new multifunctional materials with unusual coexisting properties."], ["Molecular streaming and its voltage control in angstrom-scale channels", "Over the past decade, the ability to reduce the dimensions of fluidic devices to the nanometre scale (by using nanotubes(1-5) or nanopores(6-11), for example) has led to the discovery of unexpected water- and ion-transport phenomena(12-14). More recently, van der Waals assembly of two-dimensional materials(15) has allowed the creation of artificial channels with angstrom-scale precision(16). Such channels push fluid confinement to the molecular scale, wherein the limits of continuum transport equations(17) are challenged. Water films on this scale can rearrange into one or two layers with strongly suppressed dielectric permittivity(18,19) or form a room-temperature ice phase(20). Ionic motion in such confined channels(21) is affected by direct interactions between the channel walls and the hydration shells of the ions, and water transport becomes strongly dependent on the channel wall material(22). We explore how water and ionic transport are coupled in such confinement. Here we report measurements of ionic fluid transport through molecular-sized slit-like channels. The transport, driven by pressure and by an applied electric field, reveals a transistor-like electrohydrodynamic effect. An applied bias of a fraction of a volt increases the measured pressure-driven ionic transport (characterized by streaming mobilities) by up to 20 times. This gating effect is observed in both graphite and hexagonal boron nitride channels but exhibits marked material-dependent differences. We use a modified continuum framework accounting for the material-dependent frictional interaction of water molecules, ions and the confining surfaces to explain the differences observed between channels made of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride. This highly nonlinear gating of fluid transport under molecular-scale confinement may offer new routes to control molecular and ion transport, and to explore electromechanical couplings that may have a role in recently discovered mechanosensitive ionic channels(23)."], ["Nanometre-scale thermometry in a living cell", "Sensitive probing of temperature variations on nanometre scales is an outstanding challenge in many areas of modern science and technology(1). In particular, a thermometer capable of subdegree temperature resolution over a large range of temperatures as well as integration within a living system could provide a powerful new tool in many areas of biological, physical and chemical research. Possibilities range from the temperature-induced control of gene expression(2-5) and tumour metabolism(6) to the cell-selective treatment of disease(7,8) and the study of heat dissipation in integrated circuits(1). By combining local light-induced heat sources with sensitive nanoscale thermometry, it may also be possible to engineer biological processes at the subcellular level(2-5). Here we demonstrate a new approach to nanoscale thermometry that uses coherent manipulation of the electronic spin associated with nitrogen-vacancy colour centres in diamond. Our technique makes it possible to detect temperature variations as small as 1.8 mK (a sensitivity of 9 mK Hz(-1/2)) in an ultrapure bulk diamond sample. Using nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond nanocrystals (nanodiamonds), we directly measure the local thermal environment on length scales as short as 200 nanometres. Finally, by introducing both nanodiamonds and gold nanoparticles into a single human embryonic fibroblast, we demonstrate temperature-gradient control and mapping at the subcellular level, enabling unique potential applications in life sciences."], ["Omicron escapes the majority of existing SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies", "The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant contains 15 mutations of the receptor-binding domain (RBD). How Omicron evades RBD-targeted neutralizing antibodies requires immediate investigation. Here we use high-throughput yeast display screening(1,2) to determine the profiles of RBD escaping mutations for 247 human anti-RBD neutralizing antibodies and show that the neutralizing antibodies can be classified by unsupervised clustering into six epitope groups (A-F)-a grouping that is highly concordant with knowledge-based structural classifications(3-5). Various single mutations of Omicron can impair neutralizing antibodies of different epitope groups. Specifically, neutralizing antibodies in groups A-D, the epitopes of which overlap with the ACE2-binding motif, are largely escaped by K417N, G446S, E484A and Q493R. Antibodies in group E (for example, S309)(6) and group F (for example, CR3022)(7), which often exhibit broad sarbecovirus neutralizing activity, are less affected by Omicron, but a subset of neutralizing antibodies are still escaped by G339D, N440K and S371L. Furthermore, Omicron pseudovirus neutralization showed that neutralizing antibodies that sustained single mutations could also be escaped, owing to multiple synergetic mutations on their epitopes. In total, over 85% of the tested neutralizing antibodies were escaped by Omicron. With regard to neutralizing-antibody-based drugs, the neutralization potency of LY-CoV016, LY-CoV555, REGN10933, REGN10987, AZD1061, AZD8895 and BRII-196 was greatly undermined by Omicron, whereas VIR-7831 and DXP-604 still functioned at a reduced efficacy. Together, our data suggest that infection with Omicron would result in considerable humoral immune evasion, and that neutralizing antibodies targeting the sarbecovirus conserved region will remain most effective. Our results inform the development of antibody-based drugs and vaccines against Omicron and future variants."], ["JAZ repressor proteins are targets of the SCF<SUP>CO11</SUP> complex during jasmonate signalling", "Jasmonate and related signalling compounds have a crucial role in both host immunity and development in plants, but the molecular details of the signalling mechanism are poorly understood. Here we identify members of the jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) protein family as key regulators of jasmonate signalling. JAZ1 protein acts to repress transcription of jasmonate-responsive genes. Jasmonate treatment causes JAZ1 degradation and this degradation is dependent on activities of the SCFCOI1 ubiquitin ligase and the 26S proteasome. Furthermore, the jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile) conjugate, but not other jasmonate-derivatives such as jasmonate, 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid, or methyl-jasmonate, promotes physical interaction between COI1 and JAZ1 proteins in the absence of other plant proteins. Our results suggest a model in which jasmonate ligands promote the binding of the SCF COI1 ubiquitin ligase to and subsequent degradation of the JAZ1 repressor protein, and implicate the SCFCOI1-JAZ1 protein complex as a site of perception of the plant hormone JA-Ile."], ["Liquid Structure with Nano-Heterogeneity Promotes Cationic Transport in Concentrated Electrolytes", "Using molecular dynamics simulations, small-angle neutron scattering, and a variety of spectroscopic techniques, we evaluated the ion solvation and transport behaviors in aqueous electrolytes containing bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide. We discovered that, at high salt concentrations (from 10 to 21 mol/kg), a disproportion of cation solvation occurs, leading to a liquid structure of heterogeneous domains with a characteristic length scale of 1 to 2 nm. This unusual nano-heterogeneity effectively decouples cations from the Coulombic traps of anions and provides a 3D percolating lithium\u2013water network, via which 40% of the lithium cations are liberated for fast ion transport even in concentration ranges traditionally considered too viscous. Due to such percolation networks, superconcentrated aqueous electrolytes are characterized by a high lithium-transference number (0.73), which is key to supporting an assortment of battery chemistries at high rate. The in-depth understanding of this transport mechanism establishes guiding principles to the tailored design of future superconcentrated electrolyte systems."], ["Hierarchically porous polymer coatings for highly efficient passive daytime radiative cooling", "Passive daytime radiative cooling (PDRC) involves spontaneously cooling a surface by reflecting sunlight and radiating heat to the cold outer space.

Yttria-stabilized zirconia is perhaps the material with the most potential as an electrolyte in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), owing to its stability and near-unity ionic transference number(5). Although there exist materials with superior ionic conductivity, they are often limited by their ability to suppress electronic leakage when exposed to the reducing environment at the fuel interface. Such electronic leakage reduces fuel cell power output and the associated chemo-mechanical stresses can also lead to catastrophic fracture of electrolyte membranes(6). Here we depart from traditional electrolyte design that relies on cation substitution to sustain ionic conduction. Instead, we use a perovskite nickelate as an electrolyte with high initial ionic and electronic conductivity. Since many such oxides are also correlated electron systems, we can suppress the electronic conduction through a filling-controlled Mott transition induced by spontaneous hydrogen incorporation. Using such a nickelate as the electrolyte in free-standing membrane geometry, we demonstrate a low-temperature micro-fabricated SOFC with high performance. The ionic conductivity of the nickelate perovskite is comparable to the best-performing solid electrolytes in the same temperature range, with a very low activation energy.

Copper(I)-catalysed azide\u2013alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) triazole annulation and sulfur(VI) fluoride exchange (SuFEx) catalysis are widely regarded as click reactions2,3,4, providing rapid access to their products in yields approaching 100% while being largely orthogonal to other reactions. However, in the case of CuAAC reactions, the availability of azide reagents is limited owing to their potential toxicity and the risk of explosion involved in their preparation. Here we report another reaction to add to the click reaction family: the formation of azides from primary amines, one of the most abundant functional groups5. The reaction uses just one equivalent of a simple diazotizing species, fluorosulfuryl azide6,7,8,9,10,11 (FSO2N3), and enables the preparation of over 1,200 azides on 96-well plates in a safe and practical manner. This reliable transformation is a powerful tool for the CuAAC triazole annulation, the most widely used click reaction at present.

Activity in neuronal circuits is tightly regulated by different subtypes of inhibitory interneurons, yet their role in learning is poorly understood. Using a combination of in vivo single-unit recordings and optogenetic manipulations, we show that in the mouse basolateral amygdala, interneurons expressing parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SOM) bidirectionally control the acquisition of fear conditioning-a simple form of associative learning-through two distinct disinhibitory mechanisms. During an auditory cue, PV+ interneurons are excited and indirectly disinhibit the dendrites of basolateral amygdala principal neurons via SOM+ interneurons, thereby enhancing auditory responses and promoting cue-shock associations. During an aversive footshock, however, both PV+ and SOM+ interneurons are inhibited, which boosts postsynaptic footshock responses and gates learning. These results demonstrate that associative learning is dynamically regulated by the stimulus-specific activation of distinct disinhibitory microcircuits through precise interactions between different subtypes of local interneurons."], ["Effect of strain on the reactivity of metal surfaces", "Self-consistent density functional calculations for the adsorption of O and CO, and the dissociation of CO on strained and unstrained Ru(0001) surfaces are used to show how strained metal surfaces have chemical properties that are significantly different from those of unstrained surfaces.

The \u03b1-arylated ketones obtained from this protocol under transition-metal-free and additive-free conditions in the presence of base are formed when the key intermediate enolate traps the arylboronic acid, leading to a tetracoordinate boron intermediate. A subsequent 1,4-metallate shift affords the Suzuki-type coupling products.

Although silver has very desirable physical properties, good relative abundance and low cost, gold nanoparticles have been widely favoured owing to their proved stability and ease of use. Unlike gold, silver is notorious for its susceptibility to oxidation (tarnishing), which has limited the development of important silver-based nanomaterials. Despite two decades of synthetic efforts, silver nanoparticles that are inert or have long-term stability remain unrealized. Here we report a simple synthetic protocol for producing ultrastable silver nanoparticles, yielding a single-sized molecular product in very large quantities with quantitative yield and without the need for size sorting. The stability, purity and yield are substantially better than those for other metal nanoparticles, including gold, owing to an effective stabilization mechanism. The particular size and stoichiometry of the product were found to be insensitive to variations in synthesis parameters. The chemical stability and structural, electronic and optical properties can be understood using first-principles electronic structure theory based on an experimental single-crystal X-ray structure. Although several structures have been determined for protected gold nanoclusters(8-12), none has been reported so far for silver nanoparticles. The total structure of a thiolate-protected silver nanocluster reported here uncovers the unique structure of the silver thiolate protecting layer, consisting of Ag2S5 capping structures. The outstanding stability of the nanoparticle is attributed to a closed-shell 18-electron configuration with a large energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, an ultrastable 32-silver-atom excavated-dodecahedral(13) core consisting of a hollow 12-silver-atom icosahedron encapsulated by a 20-silver-atom dodecahedron, and the choice of protective coordinating ligands. The straightforward synthesis of large quantities of pure molecular product promises to make this class of materials widely available for further research and technology development(14-18)."], ["Identification of a mechanism of photoprotective energy dissipation in higher plants", "Under conditions of excess sunlight the efficient light-harvesting antenna(1) found in the chloroplast membranes of plants is rapidly and reversibly switched into a photoprotected quenched state in which potentially harmful absorbed energy is dissipated as heat(2,3), a process measured as the non-photochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence or qE. Although the biological significance of qE is established(4-6), the molecular mechanisms involved are not(7-9). LHCII, the main light-harvesting complex, has an inbuilt capability to undergo transformation into a dissipative state by conformational change(10) and it was suggested that this provides a molecular basis for qE, but it is not known if such events occur in vivo or how energy is dissipated in this state. The transition into the dissipative state is associated with a twist in the configuration of the LHCII-bound carotenoid neoxanthin, identified using resonance Raman spectroscopy(11). Applying this technique to study isolated chloroplasts and whole leaves, we show here that the same change in neoxanthin configuration occurs in vivo, to an extent consistent with the magnitude of energy dissipation. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy(12), performed on purified LHCII in the dissipative state, shows that energy is transferred from chlorophyll a to a low-lying carotenoid excited state, identified as one of the two luteins (lutein 1) in LHCII. Hence, it is experimentally demonstrated that a change in conformation of LHCII occurs in vivo, which opens a channel for energy dissipation by transfer to a bound carotenoid. We suggest that this is the principal mechanism of photoprotection."], ["Pharmaco-metabonomic phenotyping and personalized drug treatment", "There is a clear case for drug treatments to be selected according to the characteristics of an individual patient, in order to improve efficacy and reduce the number and severity of adverse drug reactions(1,2). However, such personalization of drug treatments requires the ability to predict how different individuals will respond to a particular drug/dose combination. After initial optimism, there is increasing recognition of the limitations of the pharmacogenomic approach, which does not take account of important environmental influences on drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion(3-5). For instance, a major factor underlying inter-individual variation in drug effects is variation in metabolic phenotype, which is influenced not only by genotype but also by environmental factors such as nutritional status, the gut microbiota, age, disease and the co- or pre-administration of other drugs(6,7). Thus, although genetic variation is clearly important, it seems unlikely that personalized drug therapy will be enabled for a wide range of major diseases using genomic knowledge alone. Here we describe an alternative and conceptually new 'pharmaco-metabonomic' approach to personalizing drug treatment, which uses a combination of pre-dose metabolite profiling and chemometrics to model and predict the responses of individual subjects. We provide proof-of-principle for this new approach, which is sensitive to both genetic and environmental influences, with a study of paracetamol (acetaminophen) administered to rats. We show pre-dose prediction of an aspect of the urinary drug metabolite profile and an association between pre-dose urinary composition and the extent of liver damage sustained after paracetamol administration."], ["Production of phosphorene nanoribbons", "Phosphorene is a mono-elemental, two-dimensional (2D) substance with outstanding, highly directional properties and a bandgap that depends on the number of layers of the material(1-8). Nanoribbons, meanwhile, combine the flexibility and unidirectional properties of one-dimensional nanomaterials, the high surface area of 2D nanomaterials and the electron-confinement and edge effects of both. The structures of nanoribbons can thus lead to exceptional control over electronic band structure, the emergence of novel phenomena and unique architectures for applications(5,6,9-24). Phosphorene's intrinsically anisotropic structure has motivated numerous theoretical calculations of phosphorene nanoribbons (PNRs), predicting extraordinary properties(5,6,12-24). So far, however, discrete PNRs have not been produced. Here we present a method for creating quantities of high-quality, individual PNRs by ionic scissoring of macroscopic black phosphorus crystals. This top-down process results in stable liquid dispersions of PNRs with typical widths of 4-50 nm, predominantly single-layer thickness, measured lengths of up to 75 mu m and aspect ratios of up to 1,000. The nanoribbons are atomically flat single crystals, aligned exclusively in the zigzag crystallographic orientation. The ribbons have remarkably uniform widths along their entire lengths, and are extremely flexible. These properties-together with the ease of downstream manipulation via liquid-phase methods-should enable the search for predicted exotic states(6,12-14,17-19,21), and an array of applications in which PNRs have been predicted to offer transformative advantages. These applications range from thermoelectric devices to high-capacity fast-charging batteries and integrated high-speed electronic circuits(6,14-16,20,23,24)."], ["Spontaneous gyrotropic electronic order in a transition-metal dichalcogenide", "Chirality is ubiquitous in nature, and populations of opposite chiralities are surprisingly asymmetric at fundamental levels(1,2). Examples range from parity violation in the subatomic weak force to homochirality in biomolecules. The ability to achieve chirality-selective synthesis (chiral induction) is of great importance in stereochemistry, molecular biology and pharmacology(2). In condensed matter physics, a crystalline electronic system is geometrically chiral when it lacks mirror planes, space-inversion centres or rotoinversion axes(1). Typically, geometrical chirality is predefined by the chiral lattice structure of a material, which is fixed on formation of the crystal. By contrast, in materials with gyrotropic order(3-6), electrons spontaneously organize themselves to exhibit macroscopic chirality in an originally achiral lattice. Although such order-which has been proposed as the quantum analogue of cholesteric liquid crystals-has attracted considerable interest(3-15), no clear observation or manipulation of gyrotropic order has been achieved so far. Here we report the realization of optical chiral induction and the observation of a gyrotropically ordered phase in the transition-metal dichalcogenide semimetal 1T-TiSe2. We show that shining mid-infrared circularly polarized light on 1T-TiSe2 while cooling it below the critical temperature leads to the preferential formation of one chiral domain. The chirality of this state is confirmed by the measurement of an out-of-plane circular photogalvanic current, the direction of which depends on the optical induction. Although the role of domain walls requires further investigation with local probes, the methodology demonstrated here can be applied to realize and control chiral electronic phases in other quantum materials(4,16). Optical chiral induction and spontaneous gyrotropic electronic order are realized in the transition-metal chalcogenide 1T-TiSe2 by using illumination with mid-infrared circularly polarized light and simultaneous cooling below the critical temperature."], ["Perovskite nickelates as electric-field sensors in salt water", "Designing materials to function in harsh environments, such as conductive aqueous media, is a problem of broad interest to a range of technologies, including energy, ocean monitoring and biological applications(1-4). The main challenge is to retain the stability and morphology of the material as it interacts dynamically with the surrounding environment. Materials that respond to mild stimuli through collective phase transitions and amplify signals could open up new avenues for sensing. Here we present the discovery of an electric-field-driven, water-mediated reversible phase change in a perovskite-structured nickelate, SmNiO35-7. This prototypical strongly correlated quantum material is stable in salt water, does not corrode, and allows exchange of protons with the surrounding water at ambient temperature, with the concurrent modification in electrical resistance and optical properties being capable of multi-modal readout. Besides operating both as thermistors and pH sensors, devices made of this material can detect sub-volt electric potentials in salt water. We postulate that such devices could be used in oceanic environments for monitoring electrical signals from various maritime vessels and sea creatures."], ["Aryl hydrocarbon receptor control of a disease tolerance defence pathway", "Disease tolerance is the ability of the host to reduce the effect of infection on host fitness. Analysis of disease tolerance pathways could provide new approaches for treating infections and other inflammatory diseases. Typically, an initial exposure to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces a state of refractoriness to further LPS challenge (endotoxin tolerance). We found that a first exposure of mice to LPS activated the ligand-operated transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and the hepatic enzyme tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase, which provided an activating ligand to the former, to down-regulate early inflammatory gene expression. However, on LPS rechallenge, AhR engaged in long-term regulation of systemic inflammation only in the presence of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1). AhR-complex-associated Src kinase activity promoted IDO1 phosphorylation and signalling ability. There sulting endotoxin-tolerant state was found to protect mice against immunopathology in Gram-negative and Gram-positive infections, pointing to a role for AhRin contributing to host fitness."], ["The nature and transport mechanism of hydrated hydroxide ions in aqueous solution", "Compared to other ions, protons (H+) and hydroxide ions (OH-) exhibit anomalously high mobilities in aqueous solutions(1). On a qualitative level, this behaviour has long been explained by 'structural diffusion'-the continuous interconversion between hydration complexes driven by fluctuations in the solvation shell of the hydrated ions. Detailed investigations have led to a clear understanding of the proton transport mechanism at the molecular level(2-8). In contrast, hydroxide ion mobility in basic solutions has received far less attention(2,3,9,10), even though bases and base catalysis play important roles in many organic and biochemical reactions and in the chemical industry. The reason for this may be attributed to the century-old notion(11) that a hydrated OH- can be regarded as a water molecule missing a proton, and that the transport mechanism of such a 'proton hole' can be inferred from that of an excess proton by simply reversing hydrogen bond polarities(11-18). However, recent studies(2,3) have identified OH- hydration complexes that bear little structural similarity to proton hydration complexes. Here we report the solution structures and transport mechanisms of hydrated hydroxide, which we obtained from first-principles computer simulations that explicitly treat quantum and thermal fluctuations of all nuclei(19-21). We find that the transport mechanism, which differs significantly from the proton hole picture, involves an interplay between the previously identified hydration complexes(2,3) and is strongly influenced by nuclear quantum effects."], ["Insights into the electrocatalysis of nitrobenzene using chemically-modified carbon nanotube electrodes", "The electrochemical behavior of nitrobenzene and its derivatives at chemically-functionalized multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) modified electrodes was studied. Experimental results showed that hydroxyl-containing MWNTs exhibited the highest electrocatalytic activity among the used MWNTs because of its weak capacitive features and oxygen-containing functional groups. The cycle voltammetrys of nitrobenzene derivatives on the MWNTs modified electrodes can be easily tuned by changing the substituted groups of nitrobenzene. Based on the experimental data, the electrochemical reaction mechanisms of nitrobenzene and its derivatives on the MWNTs modified electrodes have been discussed and analyzed."], ["Artificial chemical and magnetic structure at the domain walls of an epitaxial oxide", "Progress in nanotechnology requires new approaches to materials synthesis that make it possible to control material functionality down to the smallest scales. An objective of materials research is to achieve enhanced control over the physical properties of materials such as ferromagnets(1), ferroelectrics(2) and superconductors(3). In this context, complex oxides and inorganic perovskites are attractive because slight adjustments of their atomic structures can produce large physical responses and result in multiple functionalities(4,5). In addition, these materials often contain ferroelastic domains(6). The intrinsic symmetry breaking that takes place at the domain walls can induce properties absent from the domains themselves(7), such as magnetic or ferroelectric order and other functionalities, as well as coupling between them. Moreover, large domain wall densities create intense strain gradients, which can also affect the material's properties(8,9). Here we show that, owing to large local stresses, domain walls can promote the formation of unusual phases. In this sense, the domain walls can function as nanoscale chemical reactors. We synthesize a two-dimensional ferromagnetic phase at the domain walls of the orthorhombic perovskite terbium manganite (TbMnO3), which was grown in thin layer sunder epitaxial strain on strontium titanate (SrTiO3) substrates. This phase is yet to be created by standard chemical routes. The density of the two-dimensional sheets can be tuned by changing the film thickness or the substrate lattice parameter (that is, the epitaxial strain), and the distance between sheets can be made as small as 5 nanometres in ultrathin films(10,) such that the new phase at domain walls represents up to 25 per cent of the film volume. The general concept of using domain walls of epitaxial oxides to promote the formation of unusual phases may be applicable to other materials systems, thus giving access to new classes of nanoscale materials for applications in nanoelectronics and spintronics."], ["m<SUP>6</SUP>A facilitates hippocampus-dependent learning and memory through YTHDF1", "N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A), the most prevalent internal RNA modification on mammalian messenger RNAs, regulates the fates and functions of modified transcripts through m(6)A-specific binding proteins(1-5). In the nervous system, m(6)A is abundant and modulates various neural functions(6-11). Whereas m(6)A marks groups of mRNAs for coordinated degradation in various physiological processes(12-15), the relevance of m(6)A for mRNA translation in vivo remains largely unknown. Here we show that, through its binding protein YTHDF1, m(6)A promotes protein translation of target transcripts in response to neuronal stimuli in the adult mouse hippocampus, thereby facilitating learning and memory. Mice with genetic deletion of Ythdf1 show learning and memory defects as well as impaired hippocampal synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation. Re-expression of YTHDF1 in the hippocampus of adult Ythdf1-knockout mice rescues the behavioural and synaptic defects, whereas hippocampus-specific acute knockdown of Ythdf1 or MettI3, which encodes the catalytic component of the m(6)A methyltransferase complex, recapitulates the hippocampal deficiency. Transcriptome-wide mapping of YTHDF1-binding sites and m(6)A sites on hippocampal mRNAs identified key neuronal genes. Nascent protein labelling and tether reporter assays in hippocampal neurons showed that YTHDF1 enhances protein synthesis in a neuronal-stimulus-dependent manner. In summary, YTHDF1 facilitates translation of m(6)A-methylated neuronal mRNAs in response to neuronal stimulation, and this process contributes to learning and memory."], ["Photochemical Nickel-Catalyzed C\u2013H Arylation: Synthetic Scope and Mechanistic Investigations", "An iridium photocatalyst and visible light facilitate a room temperature, nickel-catalyzed coupling of (hetero)aryl bromides with activated \u03b1-heterosubstituted or benzylic C(sp3)\u2013H bonds. Mechanistic investigations on this unprecedented transformation have uncovered the possibility of an unexpected mechanism hypothesized to involve a Ni\u2013Br homolysis event from an excited-state nickel complex. The resultant bromine radical is thought to abstract weak C(sp3)\u2013H bonds to generate reactive alkyl radicals that can be engaged in Ni-catalyzed arylation. Evidence suggests that the iridium photocatalyst facilitates nickel excitation and bromine radical generation via triplet\u2013triplet energy transfer."], ["CO<sub>2</sub> doping of organic interlayers for perovskite solar cells", "In perovskite solar cells, doped organic semiconductors are often used as charge-extraction interlayers situated between the photoactive layer and the electrodes. The pi-conjugated small molecule 2,2 ',7,7 '-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) is the most frequently used semiconductor in the hole-conducting layer(1-6), and its electrical properties considerably affect the charge collection efficiencies of the solar cell(7). To enhance the electrical conductivity of spiro-OMeTAD, lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) is typically used in a doping process, which is conventionally initiated by exposing spiro-OMeTAD:LiTFSI blend films to air and light for several hours. This process, in which oxygen acts as the p-type dopant(8-11), is time-intensive and largely depends on ambient conditions, and thus hinders the commercialization of perovskite solar cells. Here we report a fast and reproducible doping method that involves bubbling a spiro-OMeTAD:LiTFSI solution with CO2 under ultraviolet light. CO2 obtains electrons from photoexcited spiro-OMeTAD, rapidly promoting its p-type doping and resulting in the precipitation of carbonates. The CO2-treated interlayer exhibits approximately 100 times higher conductivity than a pristine film while realizing stable, high-efficiency perovskite solar cells without any post-treatments. We also show that this method can be used to dope pi-conjugated polymers."], ["Structure of the cross-\u03b2 spine of amyloid-like fibrils", "Numerous soluble proteins convert to insoluble amyloid-like fibrils that have common properties. Amyloid fibrils are associated with fatal diseases such as Alzheimer's, and amyloid-like fibrils can be formed in vitro. For the yeast protein Sup35, conversion to amyloid-like fibrils is associated with a transmissible infection akin to that caused by mammalian prions. A seven-residue peptide segment from Sup35 forms amyloid-like fibrils and closely related microcrystals, from which we have determined the atomic structure of the cross-beta spine. It is a double beta-sheet, with each sheet formed from parallel segments stacked in register. Side chains protruding from the two sheets form a dry, tightly self-complementing steric zipper, bonding the sheets. Within each sheet, every segment is bound to its two neighbouring segments through stacks of both backbone and side-chain hydrogen bonds. The structure illuminates the stability of amyloid fibrils, their self-seeding characteristic and their tendency to form polymorphic structures."], ["Redox-switchable carboranes for uranium capture and release", "The uranyl ion (UO22+; U(vi) oxidation state) is the most common form of uranium found in terrestrial and aquatic environments and is a central component in nuclear fuel processing and waste remediation efforts. Uranyl capture from either seawater or nuclear waste has been well studied and typically relies on extremely strong chelating/binding affinities to UO22+ using chelating polymers(1,2), porous inorganic(3-5) or carbon-based(6,7) materials, as well as homogeneous(8) compounds. By contrast, the controlled release of uranyl after capture is less established and can be difficult, expensive or destructive to the initial material(2,9). Here we show how harnessing the redox-switchable chelating and donating properties of an ortho-substituted closo-carborane (1,2-(Ph2PO)(2)-1,2-C2B10H10) cluster molecule can lead to the controlled chemical or electrochemical capture and release of UO22+ in monophasic (organic) or biphasic (organic/aqueous) model solvent systems. This is achieved by taking advantage of the increase in the ligand bite angle when the closo-carborane is reduced to the nido-carborane, resulting in C-C bond rupture and cage opening. The use of electrochemical methods for uranyl capture and release may complement existing sorbent and processing systems. Redox-switchable chelation is demonstrated for a carborane cluster molecule, leading to controlled chemical or electrochemical capture and release of uranyl in monophasic or biphasic model solvent systems."], ["Mechanism of electrochemical activation of carbon electrodes: role of graphite lattice defects", "By use of Raman spectroscopy as a probe, the relationship between carbon microstructure and increasesin the heterogeneous electron-transfer rate for carbon electrodes was examined. A distinctive Raman bandat 1360 cm-1 is proportional to the density of graphitic edge planes and may be used to monitor changesin edge plane density induced by carbon pretreatment procedures. It was shown that electrochemicaloxidation of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) caused fracturing of the graphite lattice, thusincreasing edge plane density. This result is consistent with other reports from laser activation of HOPG,which correlate increased edge plane density with increased electron-transfer rate. Creation of edge planeis a phenomenon common to both oxidative and nonoxidative activation procedures and is responsiblefor HOPG activation. Arguments about the involvement of graphitic oxide or oxygen containing functionalgroups in electron-transfer activation are presented. After the present results are combined with thosefrom the literature, it appears unlikely that oxygen functional groups are involved in electron-transferactivation of several benchmark redox systems on carbon electrodes."], ["3D Printing of High Viscosity UV-Curable Resin for Highly Stretchable and Resilient Elastomer", "Elastomers prepared via vat photopolymerizationus ually exhibit unsatisfied mechanical properties owing to their insufficient growth of molecular weight upon UV exposure. Increasing the weight ratio of oligomer in the resin system is an effective approach to enhance the mechanical properties, yet the viscosity of the UV-curable resin increases dramatically; this hinders its printing. In this study, a linear scan-based vat photopolymerization (LSVP) system which can print high-viscosity resins is implemented to 3D print the oligomer-dominated UV-curable resin via a dual-curing mechanism. A polyurethane methacrylate blocking oligomer is first synthesized and then mixed with a commercialized bifunctional oligomer, photoinitiator, and primary amine as a chain extender to prepare high-viscosity UV-curable resin for the LSVP system. The deblocked isocyanate is further crosslinked with a chain extender via thermal treatment to construct a highly entangled polymer chain network. The optimal thermal treatment parameters are investigated, and the resilience of the 3D-printed elastomer is evaluated through continuous tensile loading and unloading tests. Subsequently, complex structured elastomers are printed, exhibiting favorable mechanical durability without defects. The results obtained from this work will provide a reference for preparing elastomeric devices with excellent physical properties and expand the application scope of vat photopolymerization to new fields."], ["Structural basis for gibberellin recognition by its receptor GID1", "Gibberellins ( GAs) are phytohormones essential for many developmental processes in plants(1). A nuclear GA receptor, GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVEDWARF1 ( GID1), has a primary structure similar to that of the hormone- sensitive lipases (HSLs)(2,3). Here we analyse the crystal structure of Oryza sativa GID1 (OsGID1) bound with GA(4) and GA(3) at 1.9 angstrom resolution. The overall structure of both complexes shows an alpha/beta-hydrolase fold similar to that of HSLs except for an amino- terminal lid. The GA- binding pocket corresponds to the substrate- binding site of HSLs. On the basis of the OsGID1 structure, we mutagenized important residues for GA binding and examined their binding activities. Almost all of them showed very little or no activity, confirming that the residues revealed by structural analysis are important for GA binding. The replacement of Ile 133 with Leu or Val - residues corresponding to those of the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii GID1s - caused an increase in the binding affinity for GA(34), a 2 beta-hydroxylated GA(4). These observations indicate that GID1 originated from HSL and was further modified to have higher affinity and more strict selectivity for bioactive GAs by adapting the amino acids involved in GA binding in the course of plant evolution."], ["A universal trade-off between growth and lag in fluctuating environments", "A model of sequential flux bottlenecks explains a universal trade-off between steady-state growth and physiological adaptation time in bacteria exposed to fluctuating growth conditions. The rate of cell growth is crucial for bacterial fitness and drives the allocation of bacterial resources, affecting, for example, the expression levels of proteins dedicated to metabolism and biosynthesis(1,2). It is unclear, however, what ultimately determines growth rates in different environmental conditions. Moreover, increasing evidence suggests that other objectives are also important(3-7), such as the rate of physiological adaptation to changing environments(8,9). A common challenge for cells is that these objectives cannot be independently optimized, and maximizing one often reduces another. Many such trade-offs have indeed been hypothesized on the basis of qualitative correlative studies(8-11). Here we report a trade-off between steady-state growth rate and physiological adaptability inEscherichia coli, observed when a growing culture is abruptly shifted from a preferred carbon source such as glucose to fermentation products such as acetate. These metabolic transitions, common for enteric bacteria, are often accompanied by multi-hour lags before growth resumes. Metabolomic analysis reveals that long lags result from the depletion of key metabolites that follows the sudden reversal in the central carbon flux owing to the imposed nutrient shifts. A model of sequential flux limitation not only explains the observed trade-off between growth and adaptability, but also allows quantitative predictions regarding the universal occurrence of such tradeoffs, based on the opposing enzyme requirements of glycolysis versus gluconeogenesis. We validate these predictions experimentally for many different nutrient shifts inE. coli, as well as for other respiro-fermentative microorganisms, includingBacillus subtilisandSaccharomyces cerevisiae."], ["Engineered two-dimensional Ising interactions in a trapped-ion quantum simulator with hundreds of spins", "The presence of long-range quantum spin correlations underlies a variety of physical phenomena in condensed-matter systems, potentially including high-temperature superconductivity(1,2). However, many properties of exotic, strongly correlated spin systems, such as spin liquids, have proved difficult to study, in part because calculations involving N-body entanglement become intractable for as few as N approximate to 30 particles(3). Feynman predicted that a quantum simulator-a special-purpose 'analogue' processor built using quantum bits (qubits)-would be inherently suited to solving such problems(4,5). In the context of quantum magnetism, a number of experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach(6-14), but simulations allowing controlled, tunable interactions between spins localized on two- or three-dimensional lattices of more than a few tens of qubits have yet to be demonstrated, in part because of the technical challenge of realizing large-scale qubit arrays. Here we demonstrate a variable-range Ising-type spin-spin interaction, J(i,j), on a naturally occurring, two-dimensional triangular crystal lattice of hundreds of spin-half particles (beryllium ions stored in a Penning trap). This is a computationally relevant scale more than an order of magnitude larger than previous experiments. We show that a spin-dependent optical dipole force can produce an antiferromagnetic interaction J(i,j) proportional to d(i,j)(-a), where 0 <= a <= 3 and d(i,j) is the distance between spin pairs. These power laws correspond physically to infinite-range (a = 0), Coulomb-like (a = 1), monopole-dipole (a = 2) and dipole-dipole (a = 3) couplings. Experimentally, we demonstrate excellent agreement with a theory for 0.05 less than or similar to a less than or similar to 1.4.

The chaotropic effect becomes most effective for very large ions that extend beyond the classical Hofmeister scale and that can be referred to as superchaotropic ions (for example, borate clusters and polyoxometalates). In this Minireview, we present a continuous scale of water\u2013solute interactions that includes the solvation of kosmotropic, chaotropic, and hydrophobic solutes, as well as the creation of void space (cavitation).

These scaffolds represent promising leads for the research and development of a human respiratory syncytial virus vaccine needed to protect infants, young children and the elderly.

Two-dimensional metal carbides and nitrides, known as MXenes, combine metallic conductivity and hydrophilic surfaces. Here, we demonstrate the potential of several MXenes and their polymer composites for EMI shielding. A 45-micrometer-thick Ti3C2Tx film exhibited EMI shielding effectiveness of 92 decibels (>50 decibels for a 2.5-micrometer film), which is the highest among synthetic materials of comparable thickness produced to date. This performance originates from the excellent electrical conductivity of Ti3C2Tx films (4600 Siemens per centimeter) and multiple internal reflections from Ti3C2Tx flakes in free-standing films. The mechanical flexibility and easy coating capability offered by MXenes and their composites enable them to shield surfaces of any shape while providing high EMI shielding efficiency."], ["Static non-reciprocity in mechanical metamaterials", "Reciprocity is a general, fundamental principle governing various physical systems, which ensures that the transfer function-the transmission of a physical quantity, say light intensity-between any two points in space is identical, regardless of geometrical or material asymmetries. Breaking this transmission symmetry offers enhanced control over signal transport, isolation and source protection(1-6). So far, devices that break reciprocity (and therefore show non-reciprocity) have been mostly considered in dynamic systems involving electromagnetic, acoustic and mechanical wave propagation associated with fields varying in space and time. Here we show that it is possible to break reciprocity in static systems, realizing mechanical metamaterials(7-16) that exhibit vastly different output displacements under excitation from different sides, as well as one-way displacement amplification. This is achieved by combining large nonlinearities with suitable geometrical asymmetries and/or topological features. In addition to extending non-reciprocity and isolation to statics, our work sheds light on energy propagation in nonlinear materials with asymmetric crystalline structures and topological properties. We anticipate that breaking reciprocity will open avenues for energy absorption, conversion and harvesting, soft robotics, prosthetics and optomechanics."], ["Interaction and signalling between a cosmopolitan phytoplankton and associated bacteria", "Interactions between primary producers and bacteria impact the physiology of both partners, alter the chemistry of their environment, and shape ecosystem diversity(1,2). In marine ecosystems, these interactions are difficult to study partly because the major photosynthetic organisms are microscopic, unicellular phytoplankton(3). Coastal phytoplankton communities are dominated by diatoms, which generate approximately 40% of marine primary production and form the base of many marine food webs(4). Diatoms co-occur with specific bacterial taxa(3), but the mechanisms of potential interactions are mostly unknown. Here we tease apart a bacterial consortium associated with a globally distributed diatom and find that a Sulfitobacter species promotes diatom cell division via secretion of the hormone indole-3-acetic acid, synthesized by the bacterium using both diatom-secreted and endogenous tryptophan. Indole-3-acetic acid and tryptophan serve as signalling molecules that are part of a complex exchange of nutrients, including diatom-excreted organosulfur molecules and bacterial-excreted ammonia. The potential prevalence of this mode of signalling in the oceans is corroborated by metabolite and metatranscriptome analyses that show widespread indole-3-acetic acid production by Sulfitobacter-related bacteria, particularly in coastal environments. Our study expands on the emerging recognition that marine microbial communities are part of tightly connected networks by providing evidence that these interactions are mediated through production and exchange of infochemicals."], ["The catalytic pathway of horseradish peroxidase at high resolution", "A molecular description of oxygen and peroxide activation in biological systems is difficult, because electrons liberated during X-ray data collection reduce the active centres of redox enzymes catalysing these reactions(1-5).

Reduction of silver nitrate with hydroxylamine hydrochloride at alkaline pH and at room temperature yields highly sensitive SERS colloids within a short time. The so-produced colloids can be used for SERS spectroscopy immediately after preparation. The overall procedure is fast, simple, and characterized by a high preparation success rate. Changing the mixing order and rate of the two involved solutions, silver nitrate and hydroxylamine hydrochloride containing sodium hydroxide, one can control the size and dispersion of the produced colloids. The obtained colloids have been characterized by UV\u2212vis spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and SERS using a 1064 nm laser line on a Fourier transform and a 785 nm laser line on a dispersive Raman spectrometer. The SERS enhancement factor of the hydroxylamine-reduced silver colloids was tested using crystal violet, rhodamine 6G, methylene blue, and 9-aminoacridine. It was found that for both excitation lines sensitivities comparable to those achievable with a Lee\u2212Meisel silver colloid were obtained thus rendering the new colloid advantageous because of its significantly simpler and faster synthesis."], ["Stochastic transport through carbon nanotubes in lipid bilayers and live cell membranes", "There is much interest in developing synthetic analogues of biological membrane channels(1) with high efficiency and exquisite selectivity for transporting ions and molecules. Bottom-up(2) and top-down(3) methods can produce nanopores of a size comparable to that of endogenous protein channels, but replicating their affinity and transport properties remains challenging. In principle, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) should be an ideal membrane channel platform: they exhibit excellent transport properties(4-8) and their narrow hydrophobic inner pores mimic structural motifs typical of biological channels(1). Moreover, simulations predict that CNTs with a length comparable to the thickness of a lipid bilayer membrane can self-insert into the membrane(9,10). Functionalized CNTs have indeed been found to penetrate lipid membranes and cell walls(11,12), and short tubes have been forced into membranes to create sensors(13), yet membrane transport applications of short CNTs remain underexplored. Here we show that short CNTs spontaneously insert into lipid bilayers and live cell membranes to form channels that exhibit a unitary conductance of 70-100 picosiemens under physiological conditions. Despite their structural simplicity, these 'CNT porins' transport water, protons, small ions and DNA, stochastically switch between metastable conductance substates, and display characteristic macromolecule-induced ionic current blockades. We also show that local channel and membrane charges can control the conductance and ion selectivity of the CNT porins, thereby establishing these nanopores as a promising biomimetic platform for developing cell interfaces, studying transport in biological channels, and creating stochastic sensors."], ["Bubble casting soft robotics", "Inspired by living organisms, soft robots are developed from intrinsically compliant materials, enabling continuous motions that mimic animal and vegetal movement(1). In soft robots, the canonical hinges and bolts are replaced by elastomers assembled into actuators programmed to change shape following the application of stimuli, for example pneumatic inflation(2-5). The morphing information is typically directly embedded within the shape of these actuators, whose assembly is facilitated by recent advances in rapid prototyping techniques(6-11). Yet, these manufacturing processes have limitations in scalability, design flexibility and robustness. Here we demonstrate a new all-in-one methodology for the fabrication and the programming of soft machines. Instead of relying on the assembly of individual parts, our approach harnesses interfacial flows in elastomers that progressively cure to robustly produce monolithic pneumatic actuators whose shape can easily be tailored to suit applications ranging from artificial muscles to grippers. We rationalize the fluid mechanics at play in the assembly of our actuators and model their subsequent morphing. We leverage this quantitative knowledge to program these soft machines and produce complex functionalities, for example sequential motion obtained from a monotonic stimulus. We expect that the flexibility, robustness and predictive nature of our methodology will accelerate the proliferation of soft robotics by enabling the assembly of complex actuators, for example long, tortuous or vascular structures, thereby paving the way towards new functionalities stemming from geometric and material nonlinearities.

Of the many device-level and infrastructure challenges that need to be overcome before wide commercialization can be realized, one of the most critical ones is increasing the PEMFC power density, and ambitious goals have been proposed globally. For example, the short- and long-term power density goals of Japan's New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization are 6 kilowatts per litre by 2030 and 9 kilowatts per litre by 2040, respectively. To this end, here we propose technical development directions for next-generation high-power-density PEMFCs. We present the latest ideas for improvements in the membrane electrode assembly and its components with regard to water and thermal management and materials. These concepts are expected to be implemented in next-generation PEMFCs to achieve high power density.

Before the invention of secondary LIBs, the primary lithium-thionyl chloride (Li-SOCl2) battery was developed in the 1970s using SOCl2 as the catholyte, lithium metal as the anode and amorphous carbon as the cathode(1-7). This battery discharges by lithium oxidation and catholyte reduction to sulfur, sulfur dioxide and lithium chloride, is well known for its high energy density and is widely used in real-world applications; however, it has not been made rechargeable since its invention(8-13). Here we show that with a highly microporous carbon positive electrode, a starting electrolyte composed of aluminium chloride in SOCl2 with fluoride-based additives, and either sodium or lithium as the negative electrode, we can produce a rechargeable Na/Cl-2 or Li/Cl-2 battery operating via redox between mainly Cl-2/Cl- in the micropores of carbon and Na/Na+ or Li/Li+ redox on the sodium or lithium metal. The reversible Cl-2/NaCl or Cl-2/LiCl redox in the microporous carbon affords rechargeability at the positive electrode side and the thin alkali-fluoride-doped alkali-chloride solid electrolyte interface stabilizes the negative electrode, both are critical to secondary alkali-metal/Cl-2 batteries. Rechargeable Na/Cl-2 and Li/Cl-2 batteries are produced with a microporous carbon positive electrode, aluminium chloride in thionyl chloride as the electrolyte, and either sodium or lithium as the negative electrode."], ["Simultaneously enhanced tenacity, rupture work, and thermal conductivity of carbon nanotube fibers by raising effective tube portion", "Although individual carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are superior to polymer chains, the mechanical and thermal properties of CNT fibers (CNTFs) remain inferior to synthetic fibers because of the failure of embedding CNTs effectively in superstructures. Conventional techniques resulted in a mild improvement of target properties while degrading others. Here, a double-drawing technique is developed to rearrange the constituent CNTs. Consequently, the mechanical and thermal properties of the resulting CNTFs can simultaneously reach their highest performances with specific strength ~3.30 N tex\u22121 (4.60 GPa), work of rupture ~70 J g\u22121, and thermal conductivity ~354 W m\u22121 K\u22121 despite starting from low-crystallinity materials (IG:ID ~ 5). The processed CNTFs are more versatile than comparable carbon fiber, Zylon and Dyneema. On the basis of evidence of load transfer efficiency on individual CNTs measured with in situ stretching Raman, we find that the main contributors to property enhancements are the increasing of the effective tube contribution."], ["Kinetic analysis of a complete nitrifier reveals an oligotrophic lifestyle", "Nitrification, the oxidation of ammonia (NH3) via nitrite (NO2-) to nitrate (NO3-), is a key process of the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle. For decades, ammonia and nitrite oxidation were thought to be separately catalysed by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA), and by nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB). The recent discovery of complete ammonia oxidizers (comammox) in the NOB genus Nitrospira(1,2), which alone convert ammonia to nitrate, raised questions about the ecological niches in which comammox Nitrospira successfully compete with canonical nitrifiers. Here we isolate a pure culture of a comammox bacterium, Nitrospira inopinata, and show that it is adapted to slow growth in oligotrophic and dynamic habitats on the basis of a high affinity for ammonia, low maximum rate of ammonia oxidation, high growth yield compared to canonical nitrifiers, and genomic potential for alternative metabolisms. The nitrification kinetics of four AOA from soil and hot springs were determined for comparison. Their surprisingly poor substrate affinities and lower growth yields reveal that, in contrast to earlier assumptions, AOA are not necessarily the most competitive ammonia oxidizers present in strongly oligotrophic environments and that N. inopinata has the highest substrate affinity of all analysed ammonia oxidizer isolates except the marine AOA Nitrosopumilus maritimus SCM1 (ref. 3). These results suggest a role for comammox organisms in nitrification under oligotrophic and dynamic conditions."], ["Hidden diversity of vacancy networks in Prussian blue analogues", "Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are a diverse family of microporous inorganic solids, known for their gas storage ability(1), metal-ion immobilization(2), proton conduction(3), and stimuli-dependent magnetic(4,5), electronic(6) and optical(7) properties. This family of materials includes the double-metal cyanide catalysts(8,9) and the hexacyanoferrate/ hexacyanomanganate battery materials(10,11). Central to the various physical properties of PBAs is their ability to reversibly transport mass, a process enabled by structural vacancies. Conventionally presumed to be random(12,13), vacancy arrangements are crucial because they control micropore-network characteristics, and hence the diffusivity and adsorption profiles(14,15). The long-standing obstacle to characterizing the vacancy networks of PBAs is the inaccessibility of single crystals(16). Here we report the growth of single crystals of various PBAs and the measurement and interpretation of their X-ray diffuse scattering patterns. We identify a diversity of non-random vacancy arrangements that is hidden from conventional crystallographic powder analysis. Moreover, we explain this unexpected phase complexity in terms of a simple microscopic model that is based on local rules of electroneutrality and centrosymmetry. The hidden phase boundaries that emerge demarcate vacancynetwork polymorphs with very different micropore characteristics. Our results establish a foundation for correlated defect engineering in PBAs as a means of controlling storage capacity, anisotropy and transport efficiency."], ["Regioselective and Stereospecific Deuteration of Bioactive AzaCompounds by the Use of Ruthenium Nanoparticles", "An efficient H/D exchange method allowing the deuteration of pyridines, quinolines, indoles, and alkyl amines with D2 in the presence of Ru@PVP nanoparticles is described. By a general and simple procedure involving mild reaction conditions and simple filtration to recover the labeled product, the isotopic labeling of 22 compounds proceeded in good yield with high chemo- and regioselectivity. The viability of this procedure was demonstrated by the labeling of eight biologically active compounds. Remarkably, enantiomeric purity was conserved in the labeled compounds, even though labeling took place in the vicinity of the stereogenic center. The level of isotopic enrichment observed is suitable for metabolomic studies in most cases. This approach is also perfectly adapted to tritium labeling because it uses a gas as an isotopic source.

Here we describe a strategy for the rational design of diazabicyclooctane inhibitors of penicillin-binding proteins from Gram-negative bacteria to overcome multiple mechanisms of resistance, including beta-lactamase enzymes, stringent response and outer membrane permeation. Diazabicyclooctane inhibitors retain activity in the presence of beta-lactamases, the primary resistance mechanism associated with beta-lactam therapy in Gram-negative bacteria(2,3). Although the target spectrum of an initial lead was successfully re-engineered to gain in vivo efficacy, its ability to permeate across bacterial outer membranes was insufficient for further development. Notably, the features that enhanced target potency were found to preclude compound uptake. An improved optimization strategy leveraged porin permeation properties concomitant with biochemical potency in the lead-optimization stage. This resulted in ETX0462, which has potent in vitro and in vivo activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa plus all other Gram-negative ESKAPE pathogens, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and biothreat pathogens. These attributes, along with a favourable preclinical safety profile, hold promise for the successful clinical development of the first novel Gram-negative chemotype to treat life-threatening antibiotic-resistant infections in more than 25 years."], ["Signatures of moire-trapped valley excitons in MoSe<sub>2</sub>/WSe<sub>2</sub> heterobilayers", "The formation of moire patterns in crystalline solids can be used to manipulate their electronic properties, which are fundamentally influenced by periodic potential landscapes. In two-dimensional materials, a moire pattern with a superlattice potential can be formed by vertically stacking two layered materials with a twist and/or a difference in lattice constant. This approach has led to electronic phenomena including the fractal quantum Hall effect(1-3), tunable Mott insulators(4,5) and unconventional superconductivity(6). In addition, theory predicts that notable effects on optical excitations could result from a moire potential in two-dimensional valley semiconductors(7-9), but these signatures have not been detected experimentally. Here we report experimental evidence of interlayer valley excitons trapped in a moire potential in molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2)/tungsten diselenide (WSe2) heterobilayers. At low temperatures, we observe photoluminescence close to the free interlayer exciton energy but with linewidths over one hundred times narrower (around 100 microelectronvolts). The emitter g-factors are homogeneous across the same sample and take only two values, -15.9 and 6.7, in samples with approximate twist angles of 60 degrees and 0 degrees, respectively. The g-factors match those of the free interlayer exciton, which is determined by one of two possible valley-pairing configurations. At twist angles of approximately 20 degrees the emitters become two orders of magnitude dimmer; however, they possess the same g-factor as the heterobilayer at a twist angle of approximately 60 degrees. This is consistent with the umklapp recombination of interlayer excitons near the commensurate 21.8-degree twist angle(7). The emitters exhibit strong circular polarization of the same helicity for a given twist angle, which suggests that the trapping potential retains three-fold rotational symmetry. Together with a characteristic dependence on power and excitation energy, these results suggest that the origin of the observed effects is interlayer excitons trapped in a smooth moire potential with inherited valley-contrasting physics. This work presents opportunities to control two-dimensional moire optics through variation of the twist angle."], ["Effect of solvation shell structure on thermopower of liquid redox pairs", "Recent advancements in thermogalvanic batteries offer a promising route to efficient harvesting of low-grade heat with temperatures below 100 \u00b0C. The thermogalvanic temperature coefficient {\u0007lpha}, usually referred to as effective thermopower, is the key parameter determining the power density and efficiency of thermogalvanic batteries. However, the current understanding of improving {\u0007lpha} of redox pairs remains at the phenomenological level without microscopic insights, and the development of electrolytes with high {\u0007lpha} largely relies on experimental trial and error. This work applies the free energy perturbation method based on molecular dynamics simulations to predict the {\u0007lpha} of the {Fe^{3+}/Fe^{2+}} redox pair in aqueous and acetone solutions. We showed that {\u0007lpha} of the {Fe^{3+}/Fe^{2+}} redox pair can be increased from 1.5{\\pm}0.3 mV/K to 4.1{\\pm}0.4 mV/K with the increased acetone to water fraction. The predicted {\u0007lpha} of {Fe^{3+}/Fe^{2+}} both in pure water and acetone show excellent agreement with experimental values. By monitoring the fluctuation of dipole orientations in the first solvation shell, we discovered a significant change in the variance of solvent dipole orientation between Fe^{3+} and Fe^{2+}, which can be a microscopic indicator for large magnitudes of {\u0007lpha}. The effect of acetone weight fraction in the mixed acetone-water solvent on the {\u0007lpha} of {Fe^{3+}/Fe^{2+}} is also studied. Acetone molecules are found to intercalate into the first solvation shell of the {Fe^{2+}} ion at high acetone fractions, while this phenomenon is not observed in the solvation shell of the Fe^{3+} ion. Such solvation shell structure change of {Fe^{2+}} ions contributes to the enhanced {\u0007lpha} at high acetone fractions. Our discovery provides atomistic insights into how solvation shell order can be leveraged to develop electrolytes with high thermopower."], ["Maximized electron interactions at the magic angle in twisted bilayer graphene", "The electronic properties of heterostructures of atomically thin van der Waals crystals can be modified substantially by moire superlattice potentials from an interlayer twist between crystals(1,2). Moire tuning of the band structure has led to the recent discovery of superconductivity(3,4) and correlated insulating phases5 in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) near the 'magic angle' of twist of about 1.1 degrees, with a phase diagram reminiscent of high-transition-temperature superconductors. Here we directly map the atomic-scale structural and electronic properties of TBG near the magic angle using scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy. We observe two distinct van Hove singularities (VHSs) in the local density of states around the magic angle, with an energy separation of 57 millielectronvolts that drops to 40 millielectronvolts with high electron/hole doping. Unexpectedly, the VHS energy separation continues to decrease with decreasing twist angle, with a lowest value of 7 to 13 millielectronvolts at a magic angle of 0.79 degrees. More crucial to the correlated behaviour of this material, we find that at the magic angle, the ratio of the Coulomb interaction to the bandwidth of each individual VHS (U/t) is maximized, which is optimal for electronic Cooper pairing mechanisms. When doped near the half-moire-band filling, a correlation-induced gap splits the conduction VHS with a maximum size of 6.5 millielectronvolts at 1.15 degrees, dropping to 4 millielectronvolts at 0.79 degrees. We capture the doping-dependent and angle-dependent spectroscopy results using a Hartree-Fock model, which allows us to extract the on-site and nearest-neighbour Coulomb interactions. This analysis yields a U/t of order unity indicating that magic-angle TBG is moderately correlated. In addition, scanning tunnelling spectroscopy maps reveal an energy-and doping-dependent threefold rotational-symmetry breaking of the local density of states in TBG, with the strongest symmetry breaking near the Fermi level and further enhanced when doped to the correlated gap regime. This indicates the presence of a strong electronic nematic susceptibility or even nematic order in TBG in regions of the phase diagram where superconductivity is observed."], ["Arrays of horizontal carbon nanotubes of controlled chirality grown using designed catalysts", "The semiconductor industry is increasingly of the view that Moore's law-which predicts the biennial doubling of the number of transistors per microprocessor chip-is nearing its end(1). Consequently, the pursuit of alternative semiconducting materials for nanoelectronic devices, including single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), continues(2-4). Arrays of horizontal nanotubes are particularly appealing for technological applications because they optimize current output. However, the direct growth of horizontal SWNT arrays with controlled chirality, that would enable the arrays to be adapted for a wider range of applications and ensure the uniformity of the fabricated devices, has not yet been achieved. Here we show that horizontal SWNT arrays with predicted chirality can be grown from the surfaces of solid carbide catalysts by controlling the symmetries of the active catalyst surface. We obtained horizontally aligned metallic SWNT arrays with an average density of more than 20 tubes per micrometre in which 90 per cent of the tubes had chiral indices of (12, 6), and semiconducting SWNT arrays with an average density of more than 10 tubes per micrometre in which 80 per cent of the nanotubes had chiral indices of (8, 4). The nanotubes were grown using uniform size Mo2C and WC solid catalysts. Thermodynamically, the SWNT was selectively nucleated by matching its structural symmetry and diameter with those of the catalyst. We grew nanotubes with chiral indices of (2m, m) (where m is a positive integer), the yield of which could be increased by raising the concentration of carbon to maximize the kinetic growth rate in the chemical vapour deposition process. Compared to previously reported methods, such as cloning(5,6), seeding(7,8) and specific-structure-matching growth(9-11), our strategy of controlling the thermodynamics and kinetics offers more degrees of freedom, enabling the chirality of as-grown SWNTs in an array to be tuned, and can also be used to predict the growth conditions required to achieve the desired chiralities."], ["Amino acids from ultraviolet irradiation of interstellar ice analogues", "Amino acids are the essential molecular components of living organisms on Earth, but the proposed mechanisms for their spontaneous generation have been unable to account for their presence in Earth's early history(1).

Here we report the detection of amino acids in the room-temperature residue of an interstellar ice analogue that was ultraviolet-irradiated in a high vacuum at 12 K. We identified 16 amino acids; the chiral ones showed enantiomeric separation. Some of the identified amino acids are also found in meteorites.

Whereas most untethered robots use batteries to store energy and power their operation, recent advancements in energy-storage techniques enable chemical or electrical energy sources to be embodied directly within the structures and materials used to create robots, rather than requiring separate battery packs.

In such structures, information is stored in the polarization state of the ferroelectric material itself, which should in principle lead to lower power requirements, faster access time and potentially lower cost(1). But the use of ferroelectrics is not without problems; the memories constructed to date have generally suffered from poor retention of stored information and degradation of performance ('fatigue') with use(1-3). Here we describe the preparation and characterization of thin-film capacitors using ferroelectric materials from a large family of layered perovskite oxides, exemplified by SrBi2Ta2O9, SrBi2NbTaO9 and SrBi4Ta4O15. The structural flexibility of these materials allows their properties to be tailored so that many of the problems associated with previous ferroelectric memories are avoided.

Upon reduction of O2, the surface of Pt exhibits a compressive surface stress response, \u0394Stress, in both acid and base electrolytes due to adsorption of the ORR reactant and intermediates (O2, O, and OH). The magnitude of compressive \u0394Stress on Pt is greater in acid relative to base. On the other hand, the surface of Pd exhibits a negligible \u0394Stress in acid and a slight compressive \u0394Stress in base.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of adsorbate-induced excess surface stress on Pt(111) and Pd(111) surfaces imply a greater compressive surface stress induced on Pt(111) for nearly all adsorbate geometries examined. This trend, which agrees with the experimental observations, can be correlated to a greater tensile intrinsic surface stress of Pt(111) relative to Pd(111) resulting from difference in bond strength and bulk modulus of two metals. On stepped Pt(221) and Pd(221) surfaces, both the intrinsic tensile stress of the clean surface and the adsorbate-induced excess compressive stress are significantly reduced due to the presence of less coordinated, flexible step sites.

Here, we demonstrate OAM control of neutrons using macroscopic spiral phase plates that apply a ` twist' to an input neutron beam. The twisted neutron beams are analysed with neutron interferometry. Our techniques, applied to spatially incoherent beams, demonstrate both the addition of quantum angular momenta along the direction of propagation, effected by multiple spiral phase plates, and the conservation of topological charge with respect to uniform phase fluctuations.

Here we describe a single-electron transistor where the electronic levels of a single pi-conjugated molecule in several distinct charged states control the transport properties. The molecular electronic levels extracted from the single-electron-transistor measurements are strongly perturbed compared to those of the molecule in solution, leading to a very significant reduction of the gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital. We suggest, and verify by simple model calculations, that this surprising effect could be caused by image charges generated in the source and drain electrodes resulting in a strong localization of the charges on the molecule."], ["Comparative study on confinement effects of graphene and graphene oxide on structure and dynamics of water", "In this work, we compared the structural and dynamical properties of water confined between two graphene oxide (GO) sheets with water confined between two graphene sheets through molecular dynamics simulations. Our results showed how the structure and dynamics of the water near the GO surfaces changes under confinement conditions. Different orientations of the water molecules to the GO sheets confirm the heterogeneous nature of the confined water. The density distribution of water near the GO sheets is different from the graphene surfaces due to the presence of hydrophilic functional groups of the GO sheets. Also, the hydrogen bonds between the water molecules are disturbed due to the presence of these groups on the GO surfaces. The results showed that as water molecules in areas which are close to the GO surfaces are isolated, and due to hydrogen bond formation between water molecules and the substituents of the GO, the water molecules have fewer hydrogen bonds with other water molecules around. In the middle region between two GO sheets, it has been seen that each water molecule is surrounded by more water molecules, and there are many more hydrogen bonds, so it is possible to consider a network structure of water in this region. There is a good quantitative agreement between experiments and the above mentioned results. These results were confirmed by the calculated coordination number, radial distribution functions and mean square displacements."], ["Vernier templating and synthesis of a 12-porphyrin nano-ring", "Templates are widely used to arrange molecular components so they can be covalently linked into complex molecules that are not readily accessible by classical synthetic methods(1-7). Nature uses sophisticated templates such as the ribosome, whereas chemists use simple ions or small molecules. But as we tackle the synthesis of larger targets, we require larger templates-which themselves become synthetically challenging. Here we show that Vernier complexes can solve this problem: if the number of binding sites on the template, n(T), is not a multiple of the number of binding sites on the molecular building blocks, n(B), then small templates can direct the assembly of relatively large Vernier complexes where the number of binding sites in the product, n(P), is the lowest common multiple of n(B) and n(T) (refs 8, 9). We illustrate the value of this concept for the covalent synthesis of challenging targets by using a simple six-site template to direct the synthesis of a 12-porphyrin nano-ring with a diameter of 4.7 nm, thus establishing Vernier templating as a powerful new strategy for the synthesis of large monodisperse macromolecules."], ["Topological surface states protected from backscattering by chiral spin texture", "Topological insulators are a new class of insulators in which a bulk gap for electronic excitations is generated because of the strong spin-orbit coupling(1-5) inherent to these systems. These materials are distinguished from ordinary insulators by the presence of gapless metallic surface states, resembling chiral edge modes in quantum Hall systems, but with unconventional spin textures. A key predicted feature of such spin-textured boundary states is their insensitivity to spin-independent scattering, which is thought to protect them from backscattering and localization. Recently, experimental and theoretical efforts have provided strong evidence for the existence of both two-and three-dimensional classes of such topological insulator materials in semiconductor quantum well structures(6-8) and several bismuth-based compounds(9-13), but so far experiments have not probed the sensitivity of these chiral states to scattering. Here we use scanning tunnelling spectroscopy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to visualize the gapless surface states in the three-dimensional topological insulator Bi1-xSbx, and examine in detail the influence of scattering from disorder caused by random alloying in this compound. We show that, despite strong atomic scale disorder, backscattering between states of opposite momentum and opposite spin is absent. Our observations demonstrate that the chiral nature of these states protects the spin of the carriers. These chiral states are therefore potentially useful for spin-based electronics, in which long spin coherence is critical(14), and also for quantum computing applications, where topological protection can enable fault-tolerant information processing(15,16)."], ["Near-perfect photon utilization in an air-bridge thermophotovoltaic cell", "Thermophotovoltaic cells are similar to solar cells, but instead of converting solar radiation to electricity, they are designed to utilize locally radiated heat. Development of high-efficiency thermophotovoltaic cells has the potential to enable widespread applications in grid-scale thermal energy storage(1,2), direct solar energy conversion(3-8), distributed co-generation(9-11)and waste heat scavenging(12). To reach high efficiencies, thermophotovoltaic cells must utilize the broad spectrum of a radiative thermal source. However, most thermal radiation is in a low-energy wavelength range that cannot be used to excite electronic transitions and generate electricity. One promising way to overcome this challenge is to have low-energy photons reflected and re-absorbed by the thermal emitter, where their energy can have another chance at contributing towards photogeneration in the cell. However, current methods for photon recuperation are limited by insufficient bandwidth or parasitic absorption, resulting in large efficiency losses relative to theoretical limits. Here we demonstrate near-perfect reflection of low-energy photons by embedding a layer of air (an air bridge) within a thin-film In0.53Ga0.47As cell. This result represents a fourfold reduction in parasitic absorption relative to existing thermophotovoltaic cells. The resulting gain in absolute efficiency exceeds 6 per cent, leading to a very high power conversion efficiency of more than 30 per cent, as measured with an approximately 1,455-kelvin silicon carbide emitter. As the out-of-band reflectance approaches unity, the thermophotovoltaic efficiency becomes nearly insensitive to increasing cell bandgap or decreasing emitter temperature. Accessing this regime may unlock a range of possible materials and heat sources that were previously inaccessible to thermophotovoltaic energy conversion. An air gap embedded within the structure of a thermophotovoltaic device acts as a near-perfect reflector of low-energy photons, resulting in their recovery and recycling by the thermal source, enabling excellent power-conversion efficiency."], ["Short-range order and its impact on the CrCoNi medium-entropy alloy", "Traditional metallic alloys are mixtures of elements in which the atoms of minority species tend to be distributed randomly if they are below their solubility limit, or to form secondary phases if they are above it. The concept of multiple-principal-element alloys has recently expanded this view, as these materials are single-phase solid solutions of generally equiatomic mixtures of metallic elements. This group of materials has received much interest owing to their enhanced mechanical properties. They are usually called medium-entropy alloys in ternary systems and high-entropy alloys in quaternary or quinary systems, alluding to their high degree of configurational entropy. However, the question has remained as to how random these solid solutions actually are, with the influence of short-range order being suggested in computational simulations but not seen experimentally6,7. Here we report the observation, using energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy, of structural features attributable to short-range order in the CrCoNi medium-entropy alloy. Increasing amounts of such order give rise to both higher stacking-fault energy and hardness. These findings suggest that the degree of local ordering at the nanometre scale can be tailored through thermomechanical processing, providing a new avenue for tuning the mechanical properties of medium- and high-entropy alloys."], ["Shared structural mechanisms of general anaesthetics and benzodiazepines", "Most general anaesthetics and classical benzodiazepine drugs act through positive modulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors to dampen neuronal activity in the brain(1-5). However, direct structural information on the mechanisms of general anaesthetics at their physiological receptor sites is lacking. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of GABA(A)receptors bound to intravenous anaesthetics, benzodiazepines and inhibitory modulators. These structures were solved in a lipidic environment and are complemented by electrophysiology and molecular dynamics simulations. Structures of GABA(A)receptors in complex with the anaesthetics phenobarbital, etomidate and propofol reveal both distinct and common transmembrane binding sites, which are shared in part by the benzodiazepine drug diazepam. Structures in which GABA(A)receptors are bound by benzodiazepine-site ligands identify an additional membrane binding site for diazepam and suggest an allosteric mechanism for anaesthetic reversal by flumazenil. This study provides a foundation for understanding how pharmacologically diverse and clinically essential drugs act through overlapping and distinct mechanisms to potentiate inhibitory signalling in the brain. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of GABA(A)receptors bound to intravenous anaesthetics and benzodiazepines reveal both common and distinct transmembrane binding sites, and show that the mechanisms of action of anaesthetics partially overlap with those of benzodiazepines."], ["An unexpected and persistent increase in global emissions of ozone-depleting CFC-11", "The Montreal Protocol was designed to protect the stratospheric ozone layer by enabling reductions in the abundance of ozone depleting substances such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in the atmosphere(1-3). The reduction in the atmospheric concentration of trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11) has made the second-largest contribution to the decline in the total atmospheric concentration of ozone-depleting chlorine since the 1990s(1). However, CFC-11 still contributes one-quarter of all chlorine reaching the stratosphere, and a timely recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer depends on a sustained decline in CFC-11 concentrations'. Here we show that the rate of decline of atmospheric CFC-11 concentrations observed at remote measurement sites was constant from 2002 to 2012, and then slowed by about 50 per cent after 2012. The observed slowdown in the decline of CFC-11 concentration was concurrent with a 50 per cent increase in the mean concentration difference observed between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, and also with the emergence of strong correlations at the Mauna Loa Observatory between concentrations of CFC-11 and other chemicals associated with anthropogenic emissions. A simple model analysis of our findings suggests an increase in CFC-11 emissions of 13 +/- 1 5 gigagrams per year (25 +/- 13 per cent) since 2012, despite reported production being close to zero(4) since 2006. Our three-dimensional model simulations confirm the increase in CFC-11 emissions, but indicate that this increase may have been as much as 50 per cent smaller as a result of changes in stratospheric processes or dynamics. The increase in emission of CFC-11 appears unrelated to past production; this suggests unreported new production, which is inconsistent with the Montreal Protocol agreement to phase out global CFC production by 2010."], ["Efficient and stable emission of warm-white light from lead-free halide double perovskites", "Lighting accounts for one-fifth of global electricity consumption(1). Single materials with efficient and stable white-light emission are ideal for lighting applications, but photon emission covering the entire visible spectrum is difficult to achieve using a single material. Metal halide perovskites have outstanding emission properties(2,3); however, the best-performing materials of this type contain lead and have unsatisfactory stability. Here we report a lead-free double perovskite that exhibits efficient and stable white-light emission via self-trapped excitons that originate from the Jahn-Teller distortion of the AgCl6 octahedron in the excited state. By alloying sodium cations into Cs2AgInCl6, we break the dark transition (the inversion-symmetry-induced parity-forbidden transition) by manipulating the parity of the wavefunction of the self-trapped exciton and reduce the electronic dimensionality of the semiconductor(4). This leads to an increase in photoluminescence efficiency by three orders of magnitude compared to pure Cs2AgInCl6. The optimally alloyed Cs-2(Ag0.60Na0.40) InCl6 with 0.04 per cent bismuth doping emits warm-white light with 86 +/- 5 per cent quantum efficiency and works for over 1,000 hours.

Because of the negative environmental impact of plastic waste(5,6), the need for circular economies of plastics has become more pressing(7,8). However, recycling thermoset plastics is no trivial matter(1-4). Here we report a transition-metal-catalysed protocol for recovery of the polymer building block bisphenol A and intact fibres from epoxy composites. A Ru-catalysed, dehydrogenation/bond, cleavage/reduction cascade disconnects the C(alkyl)-O bonds of the most common linkages of the polymer. We showcase the application of this methodology to relevant unmodified amine-cured epoxy resins as well as commercial composites, including the shell of a wind turbine blade.

Adult bone marrow also contains adipocytes, the number of which correlates inversely with the haematopoietic activity of the marrow. Fatty infiltration of haematopoietic red marrow follows irradiation or chemotherapy and is a diagnostic feature in biopsies from patients with marrow aplasia(4). To explore whether adipocytes influence haematopoiesis or simply fill marrow space, we compared the haematopoietic activity of distinct regions of the mouse skeleton that differ in adiposity. Here we show, by flow cytometry, colony-forming activity and competitive repopulation assay, that haematopoietic stem cells and short-term progenitors are reduced in frequency in the adipocyte-rich vertebrae of the mouse tail relative to the adipocyte-free vertebrae of the thorax. In lipoatrophic A-ZIP/F1 'fatless' mice, which are genetically incapable of forming adipocytes(5), and in mice treated with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-c inhibitor bisphenol A diglycidyl ether, which inhibits adipogenesis(6), marrow engraftment after irradiation is accelerated relative to wild-type or untreated mice.

Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries with high energy density that can be safely charged and discharged at high rates are desirable for electrified transportation and other applications(1-3). However, the sub-optimal intercalation potentials of current anodes result in a trade-off between energy density, power and safety. Here we report that disordered rock salt(4,5)Li(3+x)V(2)O(5)can be used as a fast-charging anode that can reversibly cycle two lithium ions at an average voltage of about 0.6 volts versus a Li/Li(+)reference electrode. The increased potential compared to graphite(6,7)reduces the likelihood of lithium metal plating if proper charging controls are used, alleviating a major safety concern (short-circuiting related to Li dendrite growth). In addition, a lithium-ion battery with a disordered rock salt Li(3)V(2)O(5)anode yields a cell voltage much higher than does a battery using a commercial fast-charging lithium titanate anode or other intercalation anode candidates (Li(3)VO(4)and LiV0.5Ti0.5S2)(8,9). Further, disordered rock salt Li(3)V(2)O(5)can perform over 1,000 charge-discharge cycles with negligible capacity decay and exhibits exceptional rate capability, delivering over 40 per cent of its capacity in 20 seconds. We attribute the low voltage and high rate capability of disordered rock salt Li(3)V(2)O(5)to a redistributive lithium intercalation mechanism with low energy barriers revealed via ab initio calculations.

The high density of crosslinks that gives thermosets their useful properties (for example, chemical and thermal resistance and tensile strength) comes at the expense of degradability and recyclability. Here, using the industrial thermoset polydicyclopentadiene as a model system, we show that when a small number of cleavable bonds are selectively installed within the strands of thermosets using a comonomer additive in otherwise traditional curing workflows, the resulting materials can display the same mechanical properties as the native material, but they can undergo triggered, mild degradation to yield soluble, recyclable products of controlled size and functionality. By contrast, installation of cleavable crosslinks, even at much higher loadings, does not produce degradable materials. These findings reveal that optimization of the cleavable bond location can be used as a design principle to achieve controlled thermoset degradation.

Josephson effect predicted in 1962(1) and observed experimentally in 1963(2) as quantized 'voltage steps' (the Shapiro steps) from photon-assisted tunnelling of Cooper pairs is among the most fundamental phenomena of quantum mechanics and is vital for metrological quantum voltage standards. The physically dual effect, the a.c. coherent quantum phase slip (CQPS), photon-assisted tunnelling of magnetic fluxes through a superconducting nanowire, is envisaged to reveal itself as quantized 'current steps'(3,4). The basic physical significance of the a.c. CQPS is also complemented by practical importance in future current standards, a missing element for closing the quantum metrology triangle(5,6). In 2012, the CQPS was demonstrated as superposition of magnetic flux quanta in superconducting nanowires (7). However, the direct flat current steps in superconductors, the only unavailable basic effect of superconductivity to date, was unattainable due to lack of appropriate materials and challenges in circuit engineering. Here we report the direct observation of the dual Shapiro steps in a superconducting nanowire. The sharp steps are clear up to 26 GHz frequency with current values 8.3 nA and limited by the present set-up bandwidth. The current steps were theoretically predicted in small Josephson junctions 30 years ago(5). However, unavoidable broadening in Josephson junctions prevents their direct experimental observation(8,9).

The relationship between the intrinsic physical parameters of the ion and the thermoelectric performance is established, indicating the ability to influence the hydrogen bond by the ion is a crucial factor. Among these i-TE hydrogels, the PVA/CsI hydrogel exhibits the largest ionic Seebeck coefficient, reaching 52.9 mV K\u20131, which is the largest of all i-TE materials reported to date.

Here we report the discovery of an extensive hydrothermal field at 30 degrees N near the eastern intersection of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the Atlantis fracture zone. The vent field-named 'Lost City'-is distinctly different from all other known sea-floor hydrothermal fields in that it is located on 1.5-Myr-old crust, nearly 15 km from the spreading axis, and may be driven by the heat of exothermic serpentinization reactions between sea water and mantle rocks. It is located on a dome-like massif and is dominated by steep-sided carbonate chimneys, rather than the sulphide structures typical of 'black smoker' hydrothermal fields. We found that vent fluids are relatively cool (40-75 degrees C) and alkaline (pH 9.0-9.8), supporting dense microbial communities that include anaerobic thermophiles. Because the geological characteristics of the Atlantis massif are similar to numerous areas of old crust along the Mid-Atlantic, Indian and Arctic ridges, these results indicate that a much larger portion of the oceanic crust may support hydrothermal activity and microbial life than previously thought."], ["Role of inner solvation sheath within salt\u2013solvent complexes in tailoring electrode/electrolyte interphases for lithium metal batteries", "Functional electrolyte is the key to stabilize the highly reductive lithium (Li) metal anode and the high-voltage cathode for long-life, high-energy-density rechargeable Li metal batteries (LMBs).

Recently localized high-concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) are emerging as a promising electrolyte design strategy for LMBs. Here, we use LHCEs as an ideal platform to investigate the fundamental correlation between the reactive characteristics of the inner solvation sheath on electrode surfaces due to their unique solvation structures. The effects of a series of LHCEs with model electrolyte solvents (carbonate, sulfone, phosphate, and ether) on the stability of high-voltage LMBs are systematically studied. The stabilities of electrodes in different LHCEs indicate the intrinsic synergistic effects between the salt and the solvent when they coexist on electrode surfaces. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal an intriguing general rule that the strong interactions between the salt and the solvent in the inner solvation sheath promote their intermolecular proton/charge transfer reactions, which dictates the properties of the electrode/electrolyte interphases and thus the battery performances."], ["Massive Dirac fermions in a ferromagnetic kagome metal", "The kagome lattice is a two-dimensional network of corner-sharing triangles(1) that is known to host exotic quantum magnetic states(2-4). Theoretical work has predicted that kagome lattices may also host Dirac electronic states(5) that could lead to topological(6) and Chern(7) insulating phases, but these states have so far not been detected in experiments. Here we study the d-electron kagome metal Fe3Sn2, which is designed to support bulk massive Dirac fermions in the presence of ferromagnetic order. We observe a temperature-independent intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity that persists above room temperature, which is suggestive of prominent Berry curvature from the time-reversal-symmetry-breaking electronic bands of the kagome plane. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we observe a pair of quasi-two-dimensional Dirac cones near the Fermi level with a mass gap of 30 millielectronvolts, which correspond to massive Dirac fermions that generate Berry-curvature-induced Hall conductivity. We show that this behaviour is a consequence of the underlying symmetry properties of the bilayer kagome lattice in the ferromagnetic state and the atomic spin-orbit coupling. This work provides evidence for a ferromagnetic kagome metal and an example of emergent topological electronic properties in a correlated electron system.

Polariton laser operation has been demonstrated in optically pumped semiconductor microcavities at temperatures up to room temperature(7-12), and such lasers can outperform their weak-coupling counterparts in that they have a lower threshold density(12,13). Even though polariton diodes have been realized(14-16), electrically pumped polariton laser operation, which is essential for practical applications, has not been achieved until now. Here we present an electrically pumped polariton laser based on a microcavity containing multiple quantum wells. To prove polariton laser emission unambiguously, we apply a magnetic field and probe the hybrid light-matter nature of the polaritons.

More advanced applications in soft robotics, prosthetics and wearable technology involve spatially textured mechanical functionality, which requires aperiodic architectures. However, a naive implementation of such structural complexity invariably leads to geometrical frustration (whereby local constraints cannot be satisfied everywhere), which prevents coherent operation and impedes functionality. Here we introduce a combinatorial strategy for the design of aperiodic, yet frustration-free, mechanical metamaterials that exhibit spatially textured functionalities. We implement this strategy using cubic building blocks-voxels-that deform anisotropically, a local stacking rule that allows cooperative shape changes by guaranteeing that deformed building blocks fit together as in a three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle, and three-dimensional printing. These aperiodic metamaterials exhibit long-range holographic order, whereby the two-dimensional pixelated surface texture dictates the three-dimensional interior voxel arrangement. They also act as programmable shape-shifters, morphing into spatially complex, but predictable and designable, shapes when uniaxially compressed. Finally, their mechanical response to compression by a textured surface reveals their ability to perform sensing and pattern analysis.

Microscopic light manipulation, for this purpose, is achievable through photonic bandgap materials(1,2), a special class of photonic crystals in which three-dimensional, periodic dielectric constant variations controllably prohibit electromagnetic propagation throughout a specified frequency band. This can result in the localization of photons(3-6), thus providing a mechanism for controlling and inhibiting spontaneous light emission that can be exploited for photonic device fabrication. In fact, carefully engineered line defects could act as waveguides connecting photonic devices in all-optical microchips(7), and infiltration of the photonic material with suitable liquid crystals might produce photonic bandgap structures (and hence light-flow patterns) fully tunable by an externally applied voltage(8-10). However, the realization of this technology requires a strategy for the efficient synthesis of high-quality, large-scale photonic crystals with photonic bandgaps at micrometre and sub-micrometre wavelengths, and with rationally designed line and point defects for optical circuitry. Here we describe single crystals of silicon inverse opal with a complete three-dimensional photonic bandgap centred on 1.46 mu m, produced by growing silicon inside the voids of an opal template of close-packed silica spheres that are connected by small 'necks' formed during sintering, followed by removal of the silica template.

Yet the redox potentials of common photoredox catalysts are not sufficient to reduce most aryl bromides, so synthetically useful aryl radicals are often not directly available. Therefore, the development of a distinct leaving group more appropriately matched in redox potential could enable new reactivity manifolds for metallophotoredox catalysis, especially if arylcopper(III) complexes are accessible, from which the most challenging bond-forming reactions can occur.

Circadian release of melatonin at night from the pineal gland activates melatonin receptors in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, synchronizing the physiology and behaviour of animals to the light-dark cycle(1-4). The two receptors are established drug targets for aligning circadian phase to this cycle in disorders of sleep(5,6) and depression(1-4,7-9). Despite their importance, few in vivo active MT1-selective ligands have been reported(2,8,10-12), hampering both the understanding of circadian biology and the development of targeted therapeutics. Here we docked more than 150 million virtual molecules to an MT1 crystal structure, prioritizing structural fit and chemical novelty. Of these compounds, 38 high-ranking molecules were synthesized and tested, revealing ligands with potencies ranging from 470 picomolar to 6 micromolar. Structure-based optimization led to two selective MT1 inverse agonists-which were topologically unrelated to previously explored chemotypes-that acted as inverse agonists in a mouse model of circadian re-entrainment. Notably, we found that these MT1-selective inverse agonists advanced the phase of the mouse circadian clock by 1.3-1.5 h when given at subjective dusk, an agonist-like effect that was eliminated in MT1- but not in MT2-knockout mice. This study illustrates the opportunities for modulating melatonin receptor biology through MT1-selective ligands and for the discovery of previously undescribed, in vivo active chemotypes from structure-based screens of diverse, ultralarge libraries.

Here we report that chromatin regulator tripartite motif-containing 24 (TRIM24) functions in humans as a reader of dual histone marks by means of tandem plant homeodomain (PHD) and bromodomain (Bromo) regions. The three-dimensional structure of the PHD-Bromo region of TRIM24 revealed a single functional unit for combinatorial recognition of unmodified H3K4 (that is, histone H3 unmodified at lysine 4, H3K4me0) and acetylated H3K23 (histone H3 acetylated at lysine 23, H3K23ac) within the same histone tail. TRIM24 binds chromatin and oestrogen receptor to activate oestrogen-dependent genes associated with cellular proliferation and tumour development. Aberrant expression of TRIM24 negatively correlates with survival of breast cancer patients. The PHD-Bromo of TRIM24 provides a structural rationale for chromatin activation through a non-canonical histone signature, establishing a new route by which chromatin readers may influence cancer pathogenesis."], ["Excitons and emergent quantum phenomena in stacked 2D semiconductors", "This Review discusses the exciton physics of transition metal dichalcogenides, focusing on moire patterns and exciton many-body physics, and outlines future research directions in the field. The design and control of material interfaces is a foundational approach to realize technologically useful effects and engineer material properties. This is especially true for two-dimensional (2D) materials, where van der Waals stacking allows disparate materials to be freely stacked together to form highly customizable interfaces. This has underpinned a recent wave of discoveries based on excitons in stacked double layers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), the archetypal family of 2D semiconductors. In such double-layer structures, the elegant interplay of charge, spin and moire superlattice structure with many-body effects gives rise to diverse excitonic phenomena and correlated physics. Here we review some of the recent discoveries that highlight the versatility of TMD double layers to explore quantum optics and many-body effects. We identify outstanding challenges in the field and present a roadmap for unlocking the full potential of excitonic physics in TMD double layers and beyond, such as incorporating newly discovered ferroelectric and magnetic materials to engineer symmetries and add a new level of control to these remarkable engineered materials."], ["Ballistic two-dimensional InSe transistors", "The International Roadmap for Devices and Systems (IRDS) forecasts that, for silicon-based metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) field-effect transistors (FETs), the scaling of the gate length will stop at 12 nm and the ultimate supply voltage will not decrease to less than 0.6 V (ref. (1)). This defines the final integration density and power consumption at the end of the scaling process for silicon-based chips. In recent years, two-dimensional (2D) layered semiconductors with atom-scale thicknesses have been explored as potential channel materials to support further miniaturization and integrated electronics. However, so far, no 2D semiconductor-based FETs have exhibited performances that can surpass state-of-the-art silicon FETs. Here we report a FET with 2D indium selenide (InSe) with high thermal velocity as channel material that operates at 0.5 V and achieves record high transconductance of 6 mS mu m(-1) and a room-temperature ballistic ratio in the saturation region of 83%, surpassing those of any reported silicon FETs. An yttrium-doping-induced phase-transition method is developed for making ohmic contacts with InSe and the InSe FET is scaled down to 10 nm in channel length. Our InSe FETs can effectively suppress short-channel effects with a low subthreshold swing (SS) of 75 mV per decade and drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL) of 22 mV V-1. Furthermore, low contact resistance of 62 Omega mu m is reliably extracted in 10-nm ballistic InSe FETs, leading to a smaller intrinsic delay and much lower energy-delay product (EDP) than the predicted silicon limit."], ["Uses of K2S2O8 in Metal-Catalyzed and Metal-Free Oxidative Transformations", "Carbon\u2013carbon/carbon\u2013heteroatom bond formation via oxidative transformations is a heavily explored topic at the frontier of chemistry.

The current review provides a comprehensive coverage of oxidative transformations aided with K2S2O8 in the presence or absence of a transition-metal catalyst, critical assessment of the results, and underlying mechanisms. Organic chemists may find this review to be a useful guide for the expedient synthesis of new chemical entities, to formulate mechanistic manifolds involving the sulfate radical anion, or to design novel oxidative transformations.

Here we track T cells using multi-photon microscopy to demonstrate that the chemokine CXCL10 enhances the ability of CD8(+) T cells to control the pathogen Toxoplasma gondii in the brains of chronically infected mice. This chemokine boosts T-cell function in two different ways: it maintains the effector T-cell population in the brain and speeds up the average migration speed without changing the nature of the walk statistics. Notably, these statistics are not Brownian; rather, CD8(+) T-cell motility in the brain is well described by a generalized Levy walk. According to our model, this unexpected feature enables T cells to find rare targets with more than an order of magnitude more efficiency than Brownian random walkers. Thus, CD8(+) T-cell behaviour is similar to Levy strategies reported in organisms ranging from mussels to marine predators and monkeys(4-10), and CXCL10 aids T cells in shortening the average time taken to find rare targets."], ["Substitutional doping in nanocrystal superlattices", "Doping is a process in which atomic impurities are intentionally added to a host material to modify its properties. It has had a revolutionary impact in altering or introducing electronic(1,2), magnetic(3,4), luminescent(5,6), and catalytic(7) properties for several applications, for example in semiconductors. Here we explore and demonstrate the extension of the concept of substitutional atomic doping to nanometre-scale crystal doping, in which one nanocrystal is used to replace another to form doped self-assembled superlattices. Towards this goal, we show that gold nanocrystals act as substitutional dopants in superlattices of cadmium selenide or lead selenide nanocrystals when the size of the gold nanocrystal is very close to that of the host. The gold nanocrystals occupy random positions in the superlattice and their density is readily and widely controllable, analogous to the case of atomic doping, but here through nanocrystal self-assembly. We also show that the electronic properties of the superlattices are highly tunable and strongly affected by the presence and density of the gold nanocrystal dopants. The conductivity of lead selenide films, for example, can be manipulated over at least six orders of magnitude by the addition of gold nanocrystals and is explained by a percolation model. As this process relies on the self-assembly of uniform nanocrystals, it can be generally applied to assemble a wide variety of nanocrystal-doped structures for electronic, optical, magnetic, and catalytic materials."], ["Ionic liquids and eutectic mixtures as solvent and template in synthesis of zeolite analogues", "The challenges associated with synthesizing porous materials(1) mean that new classes of zeolites (zeotypes)-such as aluminosilicate zeolites(2,3) and zeolite analogues(4)-together with new methods of preparing known zeotypes(5), continue to be of great importance.

The reaction mixture usually includes an organic template or 'structure-directing agent' that guides the synthesis pathway towards particular structures. Here we report the preparation of aluminophosphate zeolite analogues by using ionic liquids(7) and eutectic mixtures(8). An imidazolium-based ionic liquid acts as both solvent and template, leading to four zeotype frameworks under different experimental conditions. The structural characteristics of the materials can be traced back to the solvent chemistry used. Because of the vanishingly low vapour pressure of ionic liquids, synthesis takes place at ambient pressure, eliminating safety concerns associated with high hydrothermal pressures. The ionic liquid can also be recycled for further use. A choline chloride/urea eutectic mixture(8) is also used in the preparation of a new zeotype framework."], ["Limitations of a polymer-based hole transporting layer for application in planar inverted perovskite solar cells", "Planar inverted lead halide photovoltaics demonstrate remarkable photoconversion properties when employing poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) as a hole transporting layer. Herein, we elucidate the effect of ambient ultraviolet (UV) degradation on the structural and operational stability of the PTAA hole transporter through a series of rigorous optoelectrical characterization protocols. Due attention was given to the interplay between the polymer and perovskite absorber, both within the framework of a bilayer structure and fully assembled solar cells. The obtained results imply that UV degradation exerts a major influence on the structural integrity of PTAA, rather than on the interface with the perovskite light harvester. Moreover, UV exposure induced more adverse effects on tested samples than environmental humidity and oxygen, contributing more to the overall reduction of charge extraction properties of PTAA, as well as increased defect population upon prolonged UV exposure."], ["Ligand-accelerated enantioselective methylene C(sp3)\u2013H bond activation", "Effective differentiation of prochiral carbon\u2013hydrogen (C\u2013H) bonds on a single methylene carbon via asymmetric metal insertion remains a challenge.

We apply these palladium complexes to catalytic enantioselective functionalization of \u03b2-methylene C\u2013H bonds in aliphatic amides. Using bidentate ligands to accelerate C\u2013H activation of otherwise unreactive monodentate substrates is crucial for outcompeting the background reaction driven by substrate-directed cyclopalladation, thereby avoiding erosion of enantioselectivity.

As a consequence, the development of methods that simultaneously construct alkyl\u2013alkyl bonds and control stereochemistry is important, although challenging. Here we describe a strategy for enantioselective alkyl\u2013alkyl bond formation, in which a racemic alkyl electrophile is coupled with an olefin in the presence of a hydrosilane, rather than via a traditional electrophile\u2013nucleophile cross-coupling, through the action of a chiral nickel catalyst.

Out-of-equilibrium systems can display a rich variety of phenomena, including self-organized synchronization and dynamical phase transitions(1,2). More recently, advances in the controlled manipulation of isolated many-body systems have enabled detailed studies of non-equilibrium phases in strongly interacting quantum matter(3-6); for example, the interplay between periodic driving, disorder and strong interactions has been predicted to result in exotic 'time-crystalline' phases(7), in which a system exhibits temporal correlations at integer multiples of the fundamental driving period, breaking the discrete time-translational symmetry of the underlying drive(8-12). Here we report the experimental observation of such discrete time-crystalline order in a driven, disordered ensemble of about one million dipolar spin impurities in diamond at room temperature(13-15). We observe long-lived temporal correlations, experimentally identify the phase boundary and find that the temporal order is protected by strong interactions. This order is remarkably stable to perturbations, even in the presence of slow thermalization(16,17). Our work opens the door to exploring dynamical phases of matter and controlling interacting, disordered many-body systems(18-20)."], ["Scalable anisotropic cooling aerogels by additive freeze-casting", "Cooling in buildings is vital to human well-being but inevitability consumes significant energy, adding pressure on achieving carbon neutrality. Thermally superinsulating aerogels are promising to isolate the heat for more energy-efficient cooling. However, most aerogels tend to absorb the sunlight for unwanted solar heat gain, and it is challenging to scale up the aerogel fabrication while maintaining consistent properties. Herein, we develop a thermally insulating, solar-reflective anisotropic cooling aerogel panel containing in-plane aligned pores with engineered pore walls using boron nitride nanosheets by an additive freeze-casting technique. The additive freeze-casting offers highly controllable and cumulative freezing dynamics for fabricating decimeter-scale aerogel panels with consistent in-plane pore alignments. The unique anisotropic thermo-optical properties of the nanosheets combined with in-plane pore channels enable the anisotropic cooling aerogel to deliver an ultralow out-of-plane thermal conductivity of 16.9\u2009mW\u2009m\u22121 K\u22121 and a high solar reflectance of 97%.

Human antibodies such as PG9 nonetheless engage V1/V2 and neutralize 80% of HIV-1 isolates. Here we report the structure of V1/V2 in complex with PG9. V1/V2 forms a four-stranded beta-sheet domain, in which sequence diversity and glycosylation are largely segregated to strand-connecting loops. PG9 recognition involves electrostatic, sequence-independent and glycan interactions: the latter account for over half the interactive surface but are of sufficiently weak affinity to avoid autoreactivity. The structures of V1/V2-directed antibodies CH04 and PGT145 indicate that they share a common mode of glycan penetration by extended anionic loops. In addition to structurally defining V1/V2, the results thus identify a paradigm of antibody recognition for highly glycosylated antigens, which-with PG9-involves a site of vulnerability comprising just two glycans and a strand."], ["Water structural transformation at molecular hydrophobic interfaces", "Hydrophobic hydration is considered to have a key role in biological processes ranging from membrane formation to protein folding and ligand binding(1). Historically, hydrophobic hydration shells were thought to resemble solid clathrate hydrates(2-4), with solutes surrounded by polyhedral cages composed of tetrahedrally hydrogen-bonded water molecules. But more recent experimental(5-8) and theoretical(9-16) studies have challenged this view and emphasized the importance of the length scales involved. Here we report combined polarized, isotopic and temperature-dependent Raman scattering measurements with multivariate curve resolution (Raman-MCR)(17-19) that explore hydrophobic hydration by mapping the vibrational spectroscopic features arising from the hydrophobic hydration shells of linear alcohols ranging from methanol to heptanol. Our data, covering the entire 0-100 degrees C temperature range, show clear evidence that at low temperatures the hydration shells have a hydrophobically enhanced water structure with greater tetrahedral order and fewer weak hydrogen bonds than the surrounding bulk water. This structure disappears with increasing temperature and is then, for hydrophobic chains longer than similar to 1 nm, replaced by a more disordered structure with weaker hydrogen bonds than bulk water. These observations support our current understanding of hydrophobic hydration, including the thermally induced water structural transformation that is suggestive of the hydrophobic crossover predicted to occur at lengths of similar to 1 nm (refs 5, 9, 10, 14)."], ["Inspiration and application in the evolution of biomaterials", "Biomaterials, traditionally defined as materials used in medical devices, have been used since antiquity, but recently their degree of sophistication has increased significantly.

The disease-causing mutations flank the protease cleavage sites in APP and facilitate its cleavage. Here we identify a new membrane-bound aspartyl protease (Asp2) with beta-secretase activity. The Asp2 gene is expressed widely in brain and other tissues. Decreasing the expression of Asp2 in cells reduces amyloid beta-peptide production and blocks the accumulation of the carboxy-terminal APP fragment that is created by beta-secretase cleavage. Solubilized Asp2 protein cleaves a synthetic APP peptide substrate at the beta-secretase site, and the rate of cleavage is increased tenfold by a mutation associated with early-onset Alzheimer's disease in Sweden(3).

Organic redox flow batteries, made from inexpensive and sustainable redox-active materials, are promising storage technologies that are cheaper and less environmentally hazardous than vanadium-based batteries, but they have shorter lifetimes and lower energy density(2,3). Thus, fundamental insight at the molecular level is required to improve performance(4,5).

In the first method, we monitor the changes in the H-1 NMR shift of the liquid electrolyte as it flows out of the electrochemical cell. In the second method, we observe the changes that occur simultaneously in the positive and negative electrodes in the full electrochemical cell. Using the bulk magnetization changes (observed via the H-1 NMR shift of the water resonance) and the line broadening of the H-1 shifts of the quinone resonances as a function of the state of charge, we measure the potential differences of the two single-electron couples, identify and quantify the rate of electron transfer between the reduced and oxidized species, and determine the extent of electron delocalization of the unpaired spins over the radical anions. These NMR techniques enable electrolyte decomposition and battery self-discharge to be explored in real time, and show that DHAQ is decomposed electrochemically via a reaction that can be minimized by limiting the voltage used on charging.

Although great progress has been made recently with methods such as ghost imaging(7,8) and wavefront shaping(9-11), present procedures are still invasive because they require either a detector(12) or a nonlinear material(13) to be placed behind the scattering layer. Here we report an optical method that allows non-invasive imaging of a fluorescent object that is completely hidden behind an opaque scattering layer. We illuminate the object with laser light that has passed through the scattering layer. We scan the angle of incidence of the laser beam and detect the total fluorescence of the object from the front. From the detected signal, we obtain the image of the hidden object using an iterative algorithm(14,15). As a proof of concept, we retrieve a detailed image of a fluorescent object, comparable in size (50 micrometres) to a typical human cell, hidden 6 millimetres behind an opaque optical diffuser, and an image of a complex biological sample enclosed between two opaque screens.

This has raised the possibility of new mechanical computing systems that augment traditional electronic computing by interacting with and adapting to their environment. Here we discuss the use of mechanical mechanisms, and associated nonlinearities, as a means of processing information, with a viewtowards a framework in which adaptable materials and structures act as a distributed information processing network, even enabling information processing to be viewed as a material property, alongside traditional material properties such as strength and stiffness. We focus on approaches to abstract digital logic in mechanical systems, discuss how these systems differ from traditional electronic computing, and highlight the challenges and opportunitiesthat they present."], ["Synthesis and properties of a bio-based epoxy resin from 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA)", "A bio-based epoxy monomer, diglycidyl ester of 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (DGF) was synthesized for the first time from the renewable 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). For comparison study, its petroleum-based counterpart, diglycidyl ester of terephthalic acid (DGT) was also prepared. Their chemical structures were confirmed in detail by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and FT-IR before they were cured by methylhexahydrophthalic anhydride (MHHPA) and poly(propylene glycol)bis(2-aminopropyl ether) (D230), respectively. The curing behaviors were investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The thermal mechanical properties and thermal stabilities of the cured resins were evaluated using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Results showed that DGF displayed higher curing activity, elevated glass transition temperature and similar mechanical properties compared with those of the cured DGT. This study indicated that FDCA had a huge potential to replace the petroleum-based terephthalic acid in the synthesis of epoxy resins with satisfactory performance."], ["Electrochemical Vicinal Difluorination of Alkenes: Scalable and Amenable to Electron-Rich Substrates", "Fluorinated alkyl groups are important motifs in bioactive compounds, positively influencing pharmacokinetics, potency and conformation. The oxidative difluorination of alkenes represents an important strategy for their preparation, yet current methods are limited in their alkene-types and tolerance of electron-rich, readily oxidized functionalities, as well as in their safety and scalability. Herein, we report a method for the difluorination of a number of unactivated alkene-types that is tolerant of electron-rich functionality, giving products that are otherwise unattainable. Key to success is the electrochemical generation of a hypervalent iodine mediator using an \u201cex-cell\u201d approach, which avoids oxidative substrate decomposition. The more sustainable conditions give good to excellent yields in up to decagram scales."], ["Telomerase activation by genomic rearrangements in high-risk neuroblastoma", "Neuroblastoma is a malignant paediatric tumour of the sympathetic nervous system(1). Roughly half of these tumours regress spontaneously or are cured by limited therapy. By contrast, high-risk neuroblastomas have an unfavourable clinical course despite intensive multimodal treatment, and their molecular basis has remained largely elusive(2-4). Here we have performed whole-genome sequencing of 56 neuroblastomas (high-risk, n = 39; low-risk, n = 17) and discovered recurrent genomic rearrangements affecting a chromosomal region at 5p15.33 proximal of the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (TERT). These rearrangements occurred only in high-risk neuroblastomas (12/39, 31%) in a mutually exclusive fashion with MYCN amplifications and ATRX mutations, which are known genetic events in this tumour type(1,2,5). In an extended case series (n = 217), TERT rearrangements defined a subgroup of high-risk tumours with particularly poor outcome. Despite a large structural diversity of these rearrangements, they all induced massive transcriptional upregulation of TERT. In the remaining high-risk tumours, TERT expression was also elevated in MYCN-amplified tumours, whereas alternative lengthening of telomeres was present in neuroblastomas without TERT or MYCN alterations, suggesting that telomere lengthening represents a central mechanism defining this subtype. The 5p15.33 rearrangements juxtapose the TERT coding sequence to strong enhancer elements, resulting in massive chromatin remodelling and DNA methylation of the affected region. Supporting a functional role of TERT, neuroblastoma cell lines bearing rearrangements or amplified MYCN exhibited both upregulated TERT expression and enzymatic telomerase activity. In summary, our findings show that remodelling of the genomic context abrogates transcriptional silencing of TERT in high-risk neuroblastoma and places telomerase activation in the centre of transformation in a large fraction of these tumours."], ["Codon-specific translation reprogramming promotes resistance to targeted therapy", "Reprogramming of mRNA translation has a key role in cancer development and drug resistance(1). However, the molecular mechanisms that are involved in this process remain poorly understood. Wobble tRNA modifications are required for specific codon decoding during translation(2,3). Here we show, in humans, that the enzymes that catalyse modifications of wobble uridine 34 (U-34) tRNA (U-34 enzymes) are key players of the protein synthesis rewiring that is induced by the transformation driven by the BRAF(V600E) oncogene and by resistance to targeted therapy in melanoma. We show that BRAF(V600E)-expressing melanoma cells are dependent on U34 enzymes for survival, and that concurrent inhibition of MAPK signalling and ELP3 or CTU1 and/or CTU2 synergizes to kill melanoma cells. Activation of the PI3K signalling pathway, one of the most common mechanisms of acquired resistance to MAPK therapeutic agents, markedly increases the expression of U-34 enzymes. Mechanistically, U-34 enzymes promote glycolysis in melanoma cells through the direct, codon-dependent, regulation of the translation of HIF1A mRNA and the maintenance of high levels of HIF1 alpha protein. Therefore, the acquired resistance to anti-BRAF therapy is associated with high levels of U-34 enzymes and HIF1 alpha. Together, these results demonstrate that U-34 enzymes promote the survival and resistance to therapy of melanoma cells by regulating specific mRNA translation."], ["FAST PHOTOCONDUCTION IN THE HIGHLY ORDERED COLUMNAR PHASE OF A DISCOTIC LIQUID-CRYSTAL", "THE search for organic materials suitable for electronic applications dates back to the early 1950s But the only organic systems known so far to show electronic charge-carrier mobilities comparable to the amorphous inorganic semiconductors that are the mainstay of the microelectronics industry are zone-refined organic single crystals(1-4). Single crystals are difficult and costly to process, however, and are not suitable for device applications. Here we show that a highly ordered columnar (stacked) phase of disk-like organic molecules can exhibit high mobilities for photoinduced charge carriers, of the order of 0.1 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)-higher than for any organic material other than single-crystal phases. Specifically, we study the helical columnar phase of 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahexylthiotriphenylene, which can be prepared simply by cooling the isotropic liquid melt via the discotic liquid-crystal phase, in which the molecules are already stacked with a high degree of order."]]
