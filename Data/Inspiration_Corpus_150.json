[["Transition Metal (Ni, Cu, Pd)-Catalyzed Alkene Dicarbofunctionalization Reactions", "Recently, alkene dicarbofunctionalization, i.e., the powerful organic synthesis method of alkene difunctionalization with two carbon sources, emerged as a formidable reaction with immense promise to synthesize complex molecules expeditiously from simple chemicals. This reaction is generally achieved with transition metals (TMs) through interception by carbon sources of an alkylmetal [\u03b2-H\u2013C(sp3)\u2013[M]] species, a key intermediate prone to undergo rapid \u03b2-H elimination. Related prior reports, since Paolo Chiusoli and Catellani\u2019s work in 1982 [ Tetrahedron Lett. 1982, 23, 4517], have used bicyclic and disubstituted terminal alkenes, wherein \u03b2-H elimination is avoided by geometric restriction or complete lack of \u03b2-H\u2019s. With reasoning that \u03b2-H\u2013C(sp3)\u2013[M] intermediates could be rendered amenable to interception with the use of first row late TMs and formation of coordination-assisted transient metallacycles, these two strategies were implemented to address the \u03b2-H elimination problem in alkene dicarbofunctionalization reactions.\nBecause first row late TMs catalyze C(sp3)\u2013C(sp3) coupling, Cu and Ni were anticipated to impart sufficient stability to \u03b2-H\u2013C(sp3)\u2013[M] intermediates, generated catalytically upon alkene carbometalation, for their subsequent interception by carbon electrophiles/nucleophiles in three-component reactions. Additionally, such an innate property could enable alkene difunctionalization with carbon coupling partners through entropically driven cyclization/coupling reactions. The cyclometalation concept to stabilize intractable \u03b2-H\u2013C(sp3)\u2013[M] intermediates was hypothesized when three-component reactions were performed. The idea of cyclometalation to curtail \u03b2-H elimination is founded upon Whitesides\u2019s [ J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1976, 98, 6521] observation that metallacycles undergo \u03b2-H elimination much slower than acyclic alkylmetals.\nIn this Account, examples of alkene dicarbofunctionalization reactions demonstrate that Cu and Ni catalysts could enable cyclization/coupling of alkenylzinc reagents, alkyl halides, and aryl halides to afford complex carbo- and heterocycles. In addition, forming coordination-assisted transient nickellacycles enabled regioselective performance of three-component dicarbofunctionalization of various alkenyl compounds. In situ reaction of [M]-H with alkenes generated after \u03b2-H elimination induced an unprecedented metallacycle contraction process, in which six-membered metal-containing rings shrank to five-membered cycles, allowing creation of new carbon\u2013carbon bonds at allylic (1,3) positions. Applications of these regioselective alkene dicarbofunctionalization reactions are discussed."], ["Direct observation of ultrafast hydrogen bond strengthening in liquid water", "Water is one of the most important, yet least understood, liquids in nature. Many anomalous properties of liquid water originate from its well-connected hydrogen bond network, including unusually efficient vibrational energy redistribution and relaxation. An accurate description of the ultrafast vibrational motion of water molecules is essential for understanding the nature of hydrogen bonds and many solution-phase chemical reactions. Most existing knowledge of vibrational relaxation in water is built upon ultrafast spectroscopy experiments. However, these experiments cannot directly resolve the motion of the atomic positions and require difficult translation of spectral dynamics into hydrogen bond dynamics. Here, we measure the ultrafast structural response to the excitation of the OH stretching vibration in liquid water with femtosecond temporal and atomic spatial resolution using liquid ultrafast electron scattering. We observed a transient hydrogen bond contraction of roughly 0.04\u2009\u00c5 on a timescale of 80 femtoseconds, followed by a thermalization on a timescale of approximately 1 picosecond. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal the need to treat the distribution of the shared proton in the hydrogen bond quantum mechanically to capture the structural dynamics on femtosecond timescales. Our experiment and simulations unveil the intermolecular character of the water vibration preceding the relaxation of the OH stretch."], ["3D Hierarchical Electrodes Boosting Ultrahigh Power Output for Gelatin-KCl-FeCN4\u2212/3\u2212 Ionic Thermoelectric Cells", "Ionic thermoelectric (i-TE) cells, using ions as energy carriers, have theadvantage of achieving a high voltage of 1\u22125 V at approximately ambienttemperature, showing a promise as a technology for powering Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors. However, the low output power of i-TE cells restrictstheir applications. Here, a 3D hierarchical structure electrode is designed toenlarge the electroactive surface area, significantly increasing the thermogal-vanic reaction sites and decreasing the interface charge transfer resistance.The quasi-solid-state gelatin-KCl-FeCN4\u2013/3\u2013 i-TE cells achieve a record instan-taneous output power density (8.9 mW m\u20132 K \u20132 ) and an ultrahigh 2 h outputenergy density (E2h) (80 J m\u20132) under an optimal temperature range. Anaverage E2h value of 59.4 J m\u20132 is obtained over the course of a week of opera-tion. A wearable device consisting of 24 i-TE cells can generate a high voltageof 2.8 V and an instantaneous output power of 68 \u00b5W by harvesting bodyheat. A simple and easy-to-operate electrode optimization strategy is providedhere to increase the long-term output power performance of i-TE cells. Thiswork represents a promising approach to develop reliable and green powersources for IoT sensors near room temperature."], ["Polypeptide organic radical batteries", "In only a few decades, lithium-ion batteries have revolutionized technologies, enabling the proliferation of portable devices and electric vehicles(1), with substantial benefits for society. However, the rapid growth in technology has highlighted the ethical and environmental challenges of mining lithium, cobalt and other mineral ore resources, and the issues associated with the safe usage and non-hazardous disposal of batteries(2). Only a small fraction of lithium-ion batteries are recycled, further exacerbating global material supply of strategic elements(3-5). A potential alternative is to use organic-based redox-active materials(6-8) to develop rechargeable batteries that originate from ethically sourced, sustainable materials and enable on-demand deconstruction and reconstruction. Making such batteries is challenging because the active materials must be stable during operation but degradable at end of life. Further, the degradation products should be either environmentally benign or recyclable for reconstruction into a new battery. Here we demonstrate a metal-free, polypeptide-based battery, in which viologens and nitroxide radicals are incorporated as redox-active groups along polypeptide backbones to function as anode and cathode materials, respectively. These redox-active polypeptides perform as active materials that are stable during battery operation and subsequently degrade on demand in acidic conditions to generate amino acids, other building blocks and degradation products. Such a polypeptide-based battery is a first step to addressing the need for alternative chemistries for green and sustainable batteries in a future circular economy. An environmentally friendly, all-organic radical battery is demonstrated, in which redox-active polypeptides perform as both cathode and anode materials, with a metal-free organic electrolyte."], ["Orbital-specific mapping of the ligand exchange dynamics of Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub> in solution", "Transition-metal complexes have long attracted interest for fundamental chemical reactivity studies and possible use in solar energy conversion(1,2). Electronic excitation, ligand loss from the metal centre, or a combination of both, creates changes in charge and spin density at the metal site(3-11) that need to be controlled to optimize complexes for photocatalytic hydrogen production(8) and selective carbon-hydrogen bond activation(9-11). An understanding at the molecular level of how transition-metal complexes catalyse reactions, and in particular of the role of the short-lived and reactive intermediate states involved, will be critical for such optimization. However, suitable methods for detailed characterization of electronic excited states have been lacking. Here we show, with the use of X-ray laser-based femtosecond-resolution spectroscopy and advanced quantum chemical theory to probe the reaction dynamics of the benchmark transition-metal complex Fe(CO)(5) in solution, that the photo-induced removal of CO generates the 16-electron Fe(CO)(4) species, a homogeneous catalyst(12,13) with an electron deficiency at the Fe centre(14,15), in a hitherto unreported excited singlet state that either converts to the triplet ground state or combines with a CO or solvent molecule to regenerate a penta-coordinated Fe species on a sub-picosecond timescale. This finding, which resolves the debate about the relative importance of different spin channels in the photochemistry of Fe(CO)(5) (refs 4, 16-20), was made possible by the ability of femtosecond X-ray spectroscopy to probe frontier-orbital interactions with atom specificity. We expect the method to be broadly applicable in the chemical sciences, and to complement approaches that probe structural dynamics in ultrafast processes."], ["Impact of Glyme Ether Chain Length on the Interphasial Stability of Lithium-Electrode in High-Capacity Lithium-Metal Battery", "The realization of lithium-metal (Li) batteries faces challenges due to dendritic Li deposition causing internal short-circuit and low Coulombic efficiency. In this regard, the Li-deposition stability largely depends on the electrolyte, which reacts with Li to form a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with diverse physico-chemical properties, and dictates the interphasial kinetics. Therefore, optimizing the electrolyte for stability and performance remains pivotal. Hereof, glyme ethers are an emerging class of electrolytes, showing improved compatibility with metallic Li and enhanced stability in Li\u2500Air and Li\u2500Sulfur batteries. Yet, the criteria for selecting glyme solvents, particularly concerning Li deposition and dissolution processes, remain unclear. The SEI characteristics and Li deposition/dissolution processes are investigated in glyme-ether-based electrolytes with varying chain lengths, using lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and lithium nitrate (LiNO\u2083) salts under high capacity and limited electrolyte conditions. Longer glymes led to more homogeneous SEI, particularly pronounced with LiNO\u2083, minimizing surface roughness during stripping, and promoting compact Li deposits. Higher reductive stability, resulting in homogeneous interphasial properties, and slower kinetics due to high desolvation barrier and viscosity, underline stable Li growth in longer glymes. This study clarifies factors guiding the selection of glyme ether-based electrolytes in Li metal batteries, offering insights for next-generation energy storage systems."], ["Photoredox catalysis with aryl sulfonium salts enables site-selective late-stage fluorination", "Photoredox catalysis, especially in combination with transition metal catalysis, can produce redox states of transition metal catalysts to facilitate challenging bond formations that are not readily accessible in conventional redox catalysis. For arene functionalization, metallophotoredox catalysis has successfully made use of the same leaving groups as those valuable in conventional cross-coupling catalysis, such as bromide. Yet the redox potentials of common photoredox catalysts are not sufficient to reduce most aryl bromides, so synthetically useful aryl radicals are often not directly available. Therefore, the development of a distinct leaving group more appropriately matched in redox potential could enable new reactivity manifolds for metallophotoredox catalysis, especially if arylcopper(III) complexes are accessible, from which the most challenging bond-forming reactions can occur. Here we show the conceptual advantages of aryl thianthrenium salts for metallophotoredox catalysis, and their utility in site-selective late-stage aromatic fluorination."], ["Bayesian reaction optimization as a tool for chemical synthesis", "Reaction optimization is fundamental to synthetic chemistry, from optimizing the yield of industrial processes to selecting conditions for the preparation of medicinal candidates1. Likewise, parameter optimization is omnipresent in artificial intelligence, from tuning virtual personal assistants to training social media and product recommendation systems2. Owing to the high cost associated with carrying out experiments, scientists in both areas set numerous (hyper)parameter values by evaluating only a small subset of the possible configurations. Bayesian optimization, an iterative response surface-based global optimization algorithm, has demonstrated exceptional performance in the tuning of machine learning models3. Bayesian optimization has also been recently applied in chemistry4,5,6,7,8,9; however, its application and assessment for reaction optimization in synthetic chemistry has not been investigated. Here we report the development of a framework for Bayesian reaction optimization and an open-source software tool that allows chemists to easily integrate state-of-the-art optimization algorithms into their everyday laboratory practices. We collect a large benchmark dataset for a palladium-catalysed direct arylation reaction, perform a systematic study of Bayesian optimization compared to human decision-making in reaction optimization, and apply Bayesian optimization to two real-world optimization efforts (Mitsunobu and deoxyfluorination reactions). Benchmarking is accomplished via an online game that links the decisions made by expert chemists and engineers to real experiments run in the laboratory. Our findings demonstrate that Bayesian optimization outperforms human decisionmaking in both average optimization efficiency (number of experiments) and consistency (variance of outcome against initially available data). Overall, our studies suggest that adopting Bayesian optimization methods into everyday laboratory practices could facilitate more efficient synthesis of functional chemicals by enabling better-informed, data-driven decisions about which experiments to run."], ["Liquid Structure with Nano-Heterogeneity Promotes Cationic Transport in Concentrated Electrolytes", "Using molecular dynamics simulations, small-angle neutron scattering, and a variety of spectroscopic techniques, we evaluated the ion solvation and transport behaviors in aqueous electrolytes containing bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide. We discovered that, at high salt concentrations (from 10 to 21 mol/kg), a disproportion of cation solvation occurs, leading to a liquid structure of heterogeneous domains with a characteristic length scale of 1 to 2 nm. This unusual nano-heterogeneity effectively decouples cations from the Coulombic traps of anions and provides a 3D percolating lithium\u2013water network, via which 40% of the lithium cations are liberated for fast ion transport even in concentration ranges traditionally considered too viscous. Due to such percolation networks, superconcentrated aqueous electrolytes are characterized by a high lithium-transference number (0.73), which is key to supporting an assortment of battery chemistries at high rate. The in-depth understanding of this transport mechanism establishes guiding principles to the tailored design of future superconcentrated electrolyte systems."], ["Alkoxy-functionalized ionic liquid electrolytes: understanding ionic coordination of calcium ion speciation for the rational design of calcium electrolytes", "There is growing interest in the rational design of electrolytes for multivalent-ion batteries by tuning the molecular-level interactions of solvate species present in the electrolytes. Herein, we report our effort to control Ca-ion speciation in ionic liquid (IL) based electrolytes through the design of alkoxy-functionalized cations. Quantitative analysis reveals that the alkoxy-functionalized ammonium cation (N07+), bearing seven ether oxygen atoms, can effectively displace the bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anion (TFSI\u2212) from the Ca2+ ion coordination sphere, facilitating the reversible Ca deposition/stripping process. More importantly, post-analysis of Ca deposits surface chemistry and density functional theory calculations of Ca-ion speciation indicate the formation of an organic-rich, but inorganic-poor solid electrolyte interphase layer, which enables Ca2+ ion diffusion rather than passivating the Ca metal electrode. Finally, as a proof-of-concept, a prototype Ca/V2O5 cell using the optimized IL-based electrolyte ([Ca(BH4)2]0.05[N07TFSI]0.95) is demonstrated for the first time, exhibiting a remarkable initial discharge capacity of 332 mA h g\u22121 and reversible capacity of 244 mA h g\u22121."], ["Ligand-accelerated enantioselective methylene C(sp3)\u2013H bond activation", "Effective differentiation of prochiral carbon\u2013hydrogen (C\u2013H) bonds on a single methylene carbon via asymmetric metal insertion remains a challenge. Here, we report the discovery of chiral acetyl-protected aminoethyl quinoline ligands that enable asymmetric palladium insertion into prochiral C\u2013H bonds on a single methylene carbon center. We apply these palladium complexes to catalytic enantioselective functionalization of \u03b2-methylene C\u2013H bonds in aliphatic amides. Using bidentate ligands to accelerate C\u2013H activation of otherwise unreactive monodentate substrates is crucial for outcompeting the background reaction driven by substrate-directed cyclopalladation, thereby avoiding erosion of enantioselectivity. The potential of ligand acceleration in C\u2013H activation is also demonstrated by enantioselective \u03b2-C\u2013H arylation of simple carboxylic acids without installing directing groups."], ["Electromagnetic interference shielding with 2D transition metal carbides (MXenes)", "Materials with good flexibility and high conductivity that can provide electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding with minimal thickness are highly desirable, especially if they can be easily processed into films. Two-dimensional metal carbides and nitrides, known as MXenes, combine metallic conductivity and hydrophilic surfaces. Here, we demonstrate the potential of several MXenes and their polymer composites for EMI shielding. A 45-micrometer-thick Ti3C2Tx film exhibited EMI shielding effectiveness of 92 decibels (>50 decibels for a 2.5-micrometer film), which is the highest among synthetic materials of comparable thickness produced to date. This performance originates from the excellent electrical conductivity of Ti3C2Tx films (4600 Siemens per centimeter) and multiple internal reflections from Ti3C2Tx flakes in free-standing films. The mechanical flexibility and easy coating capability offered by MXenes and their composites enable them to shield surfaces of any shape while providing high EMI shielding efficiency."], ["Alkene 1,1-difunctionalizations via organometallic-radical relay", "Radical reactions play an important role in modern organic synthetic chemistry. The generation of carbon radicals from the homolytic cleavage of carbon\u2013metal bonds has been widely studied as a fundamental step in organometallic chemistry. However, the implementation of this phenomenon in catalysed cascade reactions, that is, an organometallic-radical relay, is a highly challenging undertaking due to transient radicals generated from these thermodynamically disfavoured endergonic processes. Here we disclose a set of catalytic alkene 1,1-difunctionalization reactions conceptually based on an organometallic-radical relay. This strategy enables a diversity of sp3/sp2 fragments and aryl groups to be simultaneously introduced to the same carbon of both terminal and internal alkenes with outstanding chemo- and regioselectivity. This study provides a concept for the generation of functionalized benzylic radicals, which are difficult to access by classical protocols, from non-radical feedstock alkenes and arylboronic acids."], ["White-Light Emission and Structural Distortion in New Corrugated Two-Dimensional Lead Bromide Perovskites", "Hybrid inorganic\u2013organic perovskites are developing rapidly as high performance semiconductors. Recently, two-dimensional (2D) perovskites were found to have white-light, broadband emission in the visible range that was attributed mainly to the role of self-trapped excitons (STEs). Here, we describe three new 2D lead bromide perovskites incorporating a series of bifunctional ammonium dications as templates which also emit white light: (1) \u03b1-(DMEN)PbBr4 (DMEN = 2-(dimethylamino)ethylamine), which adopts a unique corrugated layered structure in space group Pbca with unit cell a = 18.901(4) \u00c5, b = 11.782(2) \u00c5, and c = 23.680(5) \u00c5; (2) (DMAPA)PbBr4 (DMAPA = 3-(dimethylamino)-1-propylamine), which crystallizes in P21/c with a = 10.717(2) \u00c5, b = 11.735(2) \u00c5, c = 12.127(2) \u00c5, and \u03b2 = 111.53(3)\u00b0; and (3) (DMABA)PbBr4 (DMABA = 4-dimethylaminobutylamine), which adopts Aba2 with a = 41.685(8) \u00c5, b = 23.962(5) \u00c5, and c = 12.000(2) \u00c5. Photoluminescence (PL) studies show a correlation between the distortion of the \u201cPbBr6\u201d octahedron in the 2D layer and the broadening of PL emission, with the most distorted structure having the broadest emission (183 nm full width at half-maximum) and longest lifetime (\u03c4avg = 1.39 ns). The most distorted member \u03b1-(DMEN)PbBr4 exhibits white-light emission with a color rendering index (CRI) of 73 which is similar to a fluorescent light source and correlated color temperature (CCT) of 7863 K, producing \u201ccold\u201d white light."], ["Toughening Elastomers with Sacrificial Bonds and Watching Them Break", "Elastomers are widely used because of their large-strain reversible deformability. Most unfilled elastomers suffer from a poor mechanical strength, which limits their use. Using sacrificial bonds, we show how brittle, unfilled elastomers can be strongly reinforced in stiffness and toughness (up to 4 megapascals and 9 kilojoules per square meter) by introducing a variable proportion of isotropically prestretched chains that can break and dissipate energy before the material fails. Chemoluminescent cross-linking molecules, which emit light as they break, map in real time where and when many of these internal bonds break ahead of a propagating crack. The simple methodology that we use to introduce sacrificial bonds, combined with the mapping of where bonds break, has the potential to stimulate the development of new classes of unfilled tough elastomers and better molecular models of the fracture of soft materials."], ["Controlling neutron orbital angular momentum", "The quantized orbital angular momentum (OAM) of photons1 offers an additional degree of freedom and topological protection from noise. Photonic OAM states have therefore been exploited in various applications(2,3) ranging from studies of quantum entanglement and quantuminformation science(4-7) to imaging(8-12). TheOAM states of electron beams(13-15) have been shown to be similarly useful, for example in rotating nanoparticles and determining the chirality of crystals(16-19). However, although neutrons-as massive, penetrating and neutral particles-are important in materials characterization, quantum information and studies of the foundations of quantum mechanics, OAM control of neutrons has yet to be achieved. Here, we demonstrate OAM control of neutrons using macroscopic spiral phase plates that apply a ` twist' to an input neutron beam. The twisted neutron beams are analysed with neutron interferometry. Our techniques, applied to spatially incoherent beams, demonstrate both the addition of quantum angular momenta along the direction of propagation, effected by multiple spiral phase plates, and the conservation of topological charge with respect to uniform phase fluctuations. Neutron-based studies of quantum information science(20,21), the foundations of quantum mechanics(22,23), and scattering and imaging(24) of magnetic, superconducting and chiral materials have until now been limited to three degrees of freedom: spin, path and energy. The optimization of OAMcontrol, leading to well defined values ofOAM, would provide an additional quantized degree of freedom for such studies."], ["Hierarchically porous polymer coatings for highly efficient passive daytime radiative cooling", "Passive daytime radiative cooling (PDRC) involves spontaneously cooling a surface by reflecting sunlight and radiating heat to the cold outer space.

We examine their synthesis/fabrication/characterization, membrane material selection, and theoretical approaches for fundamental understanding. We also present detailed examinations of their application in fuel cell in terms of the working principles of the radiation grafting process, the fabrication of MEAs using radiation-grafted membranes, the membranes' corresponding performance in alkaline PEM fuel cells, as well as performance optimization. The paper also summarizes the challenges and mitigation strategies for radiation-grafted alkaline membranes and their application in PEM fuel cells, presenting an overall picture of the technology as it presently stands."], ["Cleavage of RIPK1 by caspase-8 is crucial for limiting apoptosis and necroptosis", "The aspartate-specific cysteine protease caspase-8 suppresses necroptotic cell death mediated by RIPK3 and MLKL. Indeed, mice that lack caspase-8 die in a RIPK3- and MLKL-dependent manner during embryogenesis(1-3). In humans, caspase-8 deficiency is associated with immunodeficiency(4) or very early onset inflammatory bowel disease(5). The substrates that are cleaved by caspase-8 to prevent necroptosis in vivo have not been defined. Here we show that knock-in mice that express catalytically inactive caspase-8(C362A) die as embryos owing to MLKL-dependent necroptosis, similar to caspase-8-deficient mice. Thus, caspase-8 must cleave itself, other proteins or both to inhibit necroptosis. Mice that express caspase-8(D212A/D218A/D225A/D387A), which cannot cleave itself, were viable, as were mice that express c-FLIP or CYLD proteins that had been mutated to prevent cleavage by caspase-8. By contrast, mice that express RIPK1(D325A), in which the caspase-8 cleavage site Asp325 had been mutated, died midgestation. Embryonic lethality was prevented by inactivation of RIPK1, loss of TNFR1, or loss of both MLKL and the caspase-8 adaptor FADD, but not by loss of MLKL alone. Thus, RIPK1(D325A) appears to trigger cell death mediated by TNF, the kinase activity of RIPK1 and FADD-caspase-8. Accordingly, dying endothelial cells that contain cleaved caspase-3 were abnormally abundant in yolk sacs of Ripk1(D325A/D325A) embryos. Heterozygous Ripk1(D325A/+) cells and mice were viable, but were also more susceptible to TNF-induced cell death than were wild-type cells or mice. Our data show that Asp325 of RIPK1 is essential for limiting aberrant cell death in response to TNF, consistent with the idea that cleavage of RIPK1 by caspase-8 is a mechanism for dismantling death-inducing complexes."], ["Supramolecular Synthons in Crystal Engineering\u2014A New Organic Synthesis", "A crystal of an organic compound is the ultimate supermolecule, and its assembly, governed by chemical and geometrical factors, from individual molecules is the perfect example of solid-state molecular recognition. Implicit in the supramolecular description of a crystal structure is the fact that molecules in a crystal are held together by noncovalent interactions. The need for rational approaches towards solid-state structures of fundamental and practical importance has led to the emergence of crystal engineering, which seeks to understand intermolecular interactions and recognition phenomena in the context of crystal packing. The aim of crystal engineering is to establish reliable connections between molecular and supramolecular structure on the basis of intermolecular interactions. Ideally one would like to identify substructural units in a target supermolecule that can be assembled from logically chosen precursor molecules. Indeed, crystal engineering is a new organic synthesis, and the aim of this article is to show that rather than being only nominally relevant to organic chemistry, this subject is well within the mainstream, being surprisingly similar to traditional organic synthesis in concept. The details vary because one is dealing here with intermolecular interactions rather than with covalent bonds; so this article is divided into two parts. The first is concerned with strategy, highlighting the conceptual relationship between crystal engineering and organic synthesis and introduces the term supramolecular synthon. The second part emphasizes methodology, that is, the chemical and geometrical properties of specific intermolecular interactions."], ["Measuring mechanical tension across vinculin reveals regulation of focal adhesion dynamics", "Mechanical forces are central to developmental, physiological and pathological processes(1). However, limited understanding of force transmission within sub-cellular structures is a major obstacle to unravelling molecular mechanisms. Here we describe the development of a calibrated biosensor that measures forces across specific proteins in cells with piconewton (pN) sensitivity, as demonstrated by single molecule fluorescence force spectroscopy(2). The method is applied to vinculin, a protein that connects integrins to actin filaments and whose recruitment to focal adhesions (FAs) is force-dependent(3). We show that tension across vinculin in stable FAs is similar to 2.5 pN and that vinculin recruitment to FAs and force transmission across vinculin are regulated separately. Highest tension across vinculin is associated with adhesion assembly and enlargement. Conversely, vinculin is under low force in disassembling or sliding FAs at the trailing edge of migrating cells. Furthermore, vinculin is required for stabilizing adhesions under force. Together, these data reveal that FA stabilization under force requires both vinculin recruitment and force transmission, and that, surprisingly, these processes can be controlled independently."], ["A gradient-distributed liquid-metal hydrogel capable of tunable actuation", "Although thermoresponsive hydrogels have numerous applications that range from soft robots, biomedical engineering, and actuators to sensors for artificial muscles, the existing hydrogel actuators undergo only unidirectional deformation under a single thermal stimulus and suffer from slow actuation and unstable interfacial adhesion in multiple layers. Herein, hydrogels containing gradient-distributed polydopamine-coated eutectic gallium-indium (PDA-EGaIn) nanodroplets in a poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) matrix and thus featuring a gradient distribution of thermal conductivity and an increased barrier towards water loss are shown to be capable of a rapid and tuneable thermoresponse. Notably, whereas hydrogels with a low content of PDA-EGaIn undergo rapid one-way bending under a single thermal (45 \u00b0C) stimulus, those with a high content of PDA-EGaIn undergo sequential bidirectional (bending) actuation. The ability of these hydrogels to undergo fast and tuneable actuation under a single thermal stimulus makes them suitable for use in grab-release instruments and soft robots."], ["The tumour suppressor CYLD negatively regulates NF-\u03baB signalling by deubiquitination", "NF-kappaB transcription factors have key roles in inflammation, immune response, oncogenesis and protection against apoptosis (1,2). In most cells, these factors are kept inactive in the cytoplasm through association with IkappaB inhibitors. After stimulation by various reagents, IkappaB is phosphorylated by the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex(3) and degraded by the proteasome, allowing NF-kappaB to translocate to the nucleus and activate its target genes. Here we report that CYLD, a tumour suppressor that is mutated in familial cylindromatosis(4), interacts with NEMO, the regulatory subunit of IKK5,6. CYLD also interacts directly with tumour-necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), an adaptor molecule involved in signalling by members of the family of TNF/ nerve growth factor receptors. CYLD has deubiquitinating activity that is directed towards non-K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, and negatively modulates TRAF-mediated activation of IKK, strengthening the notion that ubiquitination is involved in IKK activation by TRAFs and suggesting that CYLD functions in this process. Truncations of CYLD found in cylindromatosis result in reduced enzymatic activity, indicating a link between impaired deubiquitination of CYLD substrates and human pathophysiology."], ["Site-selective and versatile aromatic C\u2212H functionalization by thianthrenation", "Direct C\u2013H functionalization can quickly increase useful structural and functional molecular complexity1,2,3.

Here we report a highly selective aromatic C\u2013H functionalization reaction that does not require a particular directing group or substitution pattern to achieve selectivity, and provides functionalized arenes that can participate in various transformations. We introduce a persistent sulfur-based radical to functionalize complex arenes with high selectivity and obtain thianthrenium salts that are ready to engage in different transformations, via both transition-metal and photoredox catalysis. This transformation differs fundamentally from all previous aromatic C\u2013H functionalization reactions in that it provides direct access to a large number of derivatives of complex small molecules, quickly generating functional diversity with selectivity that is not achievable by other methods."], ["The role of proton coupled electron transfer in water oxidation", "Water oxidation is a key half reaction in energy conversion schemes based on solar fuels and targets such as light driven water splitting or carbon dioxide reduction into CO, other oxygenates, or hydrocarbons. Carrying out these reactions at rates that exceed the rate of solar insolation for the extended periods of time required for useful applications presents a major challenge. Water oxidation is the key \u201cother\u201d half reaction in these schemes and it is dominated by PCET given its multi-electron, multi-proton character, 2H2O \u2192 O2 + 4e\u2212 + 4H+. Identification of PCET was an offshoot of experiments designed to investigate energy conversion by electron transfer quenching of molecular excited states. The concepts \u201credox potential leveling\u201d and concerted electron\u2013proton transfer came from measurements on stepwise oxidation of cis-RuII(bpy)2(py)(OH2)2+ to RuIV(bpy)2(py)(O)2+. The Ru \u201cblue dimer\u201d, cis,cis-(bpy)2(H2O)RuORu(OH2)(bpy)24+, was the first designed catalyst for water oxidation. It undergoes oxidative activation by PCET to give the transient (bpy)2(O)RuVORuV(O)(bpy)24+, O-atom attack on water to give a peroxidic intermediate, and further oxidation and O2 release. More recently, a class of single site water oxidation catalysts has been identified, e.g., Ru(tpy)(bpm)(OH2)2+ (tpy is 2,2\u2032:6\u2032,2\u2032\u2032-terpyridine; bpm is 2,2\u2032-bipyrimidine). They undergo stepwise PCET oxidation to RuIV=O2+ or RuV(O)3+ followed by O-atom transfer with formation of peroxidic intermediates which undergo further oxidation and O2 release. PCET plays a key role in the three zones of water oxidation reactivity: oxidative activation, O\u22efO bond formation, oxidation and O2 release from peroxidic intermediates. Similar schemes have been identified for electrocatalytic water oxidation on oxide electrode surfaces based on phosphonated derivatives such as [Ru(Mebimpy)(4,4\u2032-(PO3H2CH2)2bpy)(OH2)]2+. A PCET barrier to RuIII\u2013OH2+ \u2192 RuIV=O2+ oxidation arises from the large difference in pKa values between RuIII\u2013OH2+ and RuIV(OH)3+. On oxide surfaces this oxidation occurs by multiple pathways. Kinetic, mechanistic, and DFT results on single site catalysts reveal a new pathway for the O\u22efO bond forming step (Atom-Proton Transfer, APT), significant rate enhancements by added proton acceptor bases, and accelerated water oxidation in propylene carbonate as solvent with water added as a stoichiometric reagent. Lessons learned about water oxidation and the role of PCET and concerted pathways appear to have direct relevance for water oxidation in Photosystem II (PSII) with PSII a spectacular example of PCET in action. This includes a key role for Multiple Site-Electron Proton Transfer in oxidative activation of the Oxygen Evolving Complex (OEC) in the S0 \u2192 S1 transition in the Kok cycle."], ["Sensitivity to antitubulin chemotherapeutics is regulated by MCL1 and FBW7", "Microtubules have pivotal roles in fundamental cellular processes and are targets of antitubulin chemotherapeutics(1). Microtubule-targeted agents such as Taxol and vincristine are prescribed widely for various malignancies, including ovarian and breast adenocarcinomas, non-small-cell lung cancer, leukaemias and lymphomas(1). These agents arrest cells in mitosis and subsequently induce cell death through poorly defined mechanisms(2). The strategies that resistant tumour cells use to evade death induced by antitubulin agents are also unclear(2). Here we show that the pro-survival protein MCL1 (ref. 3) is a crucial regulator of apoptosis triggered by antitubulin chemotherapeutics. During mitotic arrest, MCL1 protein levels decline markedly, through a post-translational mechanism, potentiating cell death. Phosphorylation of MCL1 directs its interaction with the tumour-suppressor protein FBW7, which is the substrate-binding component of a ubiquitin ligase complex. The polyubiquitylation of MCL1 then targets it for proteasomal degradation. The degradation of MCL1 was blocked in patient-derived tumour cells that lacked FBW7 or had loss-of-function mutations in FBW7, conferring resistance to antitubulin agents and promoting chemotherapeutic-induced polyploidy. Additionally, primary tumour samples were enriched for FBW7 inactivation and elevated MCL1 levels, underscoring the prominent roles of these proteins in oncogenesis. Our findings suggest that profiling the FBW7 and MCL1 status of tumours, in terms of protein levels, messenger RNA levels and genetic status, could be useful to predict the response of patients to antitubulin chemotherapeutics."], ["Increasing stability, efficiency, and fundamental understanding of lithium-mediated electrochemical nitrogen reduction", "Lithium-mediated nitrogen reduction is a proven method to electrochemically synthesize ammonia; yet the process has so far been unstable, and the continuous deposition of lithium limits its practical applicability.

Upon reduction of O2, the surface of Pt exhibits a compressive surface stress response, \u0394Stress, in both acid and base electrolytes due to adsorption of the ORR reactant and intermediates (O2, O, and OH). The magnitude of compressive \u0394Stress on Pt is greater in acid relative to base. On the other hand, the surface of Pd exhibits a negligible \u0394Stress in acid and a slight compressive \u0394Stress in base.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of adsorbate-induced excess surface stress on Pt(111) and Pd(111) surfaces imply a greater compressive surface stress induced on Pt(111) for nearly all adsorbate geometries examined. This trend, which agrees with the experimental observations, can be correlated to a greater tensile intrinsic surface stress of Pt(111) relative to Pd(111) resulting from difference in bond strength and bulk modulus of two metals. On stepped Pt(221) and Pd(221) surfaces, both the intrinsic tensile stress of the clean surface and the adsorbate-induced excess compressive stress are significantly reduced due to the presence of less coordinated, flexible step sites.

In two-dimensional materials, a moire pattern with a superlattice potential can be formed by vertically stacking two layered materials with a twist and/or a difference in lattice constant. This approach has led to electronic phenomena including the fractal quantum Hall effect(1-3), tunable Mott insulators(4,5) and unconventional superconductivity(6). In addition, theory predicts that notable effects on optical excitations could result from a moire potential in two-dimensional valley semiconductors(7-9), but these signatures have not been detected experimentally. Here we report experimental evidence of interlayer valley excitons trapped in a moire potential in molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2)/tungsten diselenide (WSe2) heterobilayers. At low temperatures, we observe photoluminescence close to the free interlayer exciton energy but with linewidths over one hundred times narrower (around 100 microelectronvolts). The emitter g-factors are homogeneous across the same sample and take only two values, -15.9 and 6.7, in samples with approximate twist angles of 60 degrees and 0 degrees, respectively. The g-factors match those of the free interlayer exciton, which is determined by one of two possible valley-pairing configurations. At twist angles of approximately 20 degrees the emitters become two orders of magnitude dimmer; however, they possess the same g-factor as the heterobilayer at a twist angle of approximately 60 degrees. This is consistent with the umklapp recombination of interlayer excitons near the commensurate 21.8-degree twist angle(7). The emitters exhibit strong circular polarization of the same helicity for a given twist angle, which suggests that the trapping potential retains three-fold rotational symmetry. Together with a characteristic dependence on power and excitation energy, these results suggest that the origin of the observed effects is interlayer excitons trapped in a smooth moire potential with inherited valley-contrasting physics.

Known homogeneous CDA systems often require the use of sacrificial hydrogen acceptors (or oxidants), precious metal catalysts, and harsh reaction conditions, thus limiting most existing methods to dehydrogenation of non- or low-functionalized alkanes. Here we describe a visible-light-driven, dual-catalyst system consisting of inexpensive organophotoredox and base-metal catalysts for room-temperature, acceptorless-CDA (Al-CDA). Initiated by photoexited 2-chloroanthraquinone, the process involves H atom transfer (HAT) of aliphatics to form alkyl radicals, which then react with cobaloxime to produce olefins and H2. This operationally simple method enables direct dehydrogenation of readily available chemical feedstocks to diversely functionalized olefins. For example, we demonstrate, for the first time, the oxidant-free desaturation of thioethers and amides to alkenyl sulfides and enamides, respectively.

Here, a protocol for quantification at ultralow concentrations using SM-SERS is proposed. The approach aims to take advantage of the stochastic nature of the single-molecule regime to achieved lower limits of quantification (LOQ). Two emerging contaminants commonly found in aquatic environments, enrofloxacin (ENRO) and ciprofloxacin (CIPRO), were chosen as nonresonant molecular probes. The methodology involves a multivariate resolution curve fitting known as non-negative matrix factorization with alternating least-squares algorithm (NMF-ALS) to solve spectral overlaps. The key element of the quantification is to realize that, under SM-SERS conditions, the Raman intensity generated by a molecule adsorbed on a \u201chotspot\u201d can be digitalized. Therefore, the number of SERS event counts (rather than SERS intensities) was shown to be proportional to the solution concentration. This allowed the determination of both ENRO and CIPRO with high accuracy and precision even at ultralow concentrations regime. The LOQ for both ENRO and CIPRO were achieved at 2.8 pM.

In contrast, aryl bromides produced high yields of products in the absence of both added base and added ligand. In order to explore the Suzuki coupling process entirely under acidic conditions, a series of reactions were conducted in buffered acidic media using several model substrates. 4-Chlorobenzylamine, in the presence of cataCXium\u00aePtB, produced high yields of product at buffered pH 6.0; the yields dropped off precipitously at buffered pH 5.0 and lower.

For an evaluation of thermoelectric conversion performance, a thermocell with a circulating electrolyte is fabricated as a candidate technology for harvesting thermal energy from liquid cooling systems. The maximum power density obtained, normalized to the square of the inter-electrode temperature difference (~4.1 \u00b0C), is 0.64 mW m\u22122K\u22122, which is approximately 1.8 times higher compared with the thermocell based on pure aqueous electrolyte."], ["Co-deposition of hole-selective contact and absorber for improving the processability of perovskite solar cells", "Simplifying the manufacturing processes of renewable energy technologies is crucial to lowering the barriers to commercialization. In this context, to improve the manufacturability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), we have developed a one-step solution-coating procedure in which the hole-selective contact and perovskite light absorber spontaneously form, resulting in efficient inverted PSCs. We observed that phosphonic or carboxylic acids, incorporated into perovskite precursor solutions, self-assemble on the indium tin oxide substrate during perovskite film processing. They form a robust self-assembled monolayer as an excellent hole-selective contact while the perovskite crystallizes. Our approach solves wettability issues and simplifies device fabrication, advancing the manufacturability of PSCs. Our PSC devices with positive\u2013intrinsic\u2013negative (p-i-n) geometry show a power conversion efficiency of 24.5% and retain >90% of their initial efficiency after 1,200\u2009h of operating at the maximum power point under continuous illumination.

This study highlights the role of ions in i-TE hydrogels employing a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) polymer matrix and a number of ion providers, e.g., KOH, KNO3, KCl, KBr, NaI, KI, and CsI. The relationship between the intrinsic physical parameters of the ion and the thermoelectric performance is established, indicating the ability to influence the hydrogen bond by the ion is a crucial factor. Among these i-TE hydrogels, the PVA/CsI hydrogel exhibits the largest ionic Seebeck coefficient, reaching 52.9 mV K\u20131, which is the largest of all i-TE materials reported to date.

Although molecular and adaptive breeding strategies can buffer the effects of climatic stress and improve crop resilience(5), these approaches require sufficient knowledge of the genes that underlie productivity and adaptation(6)-knowledge that has been limited to a small number of well-studied model systems. Here we present the assembly and annotation of the large and complex genome of the polyploid bioenergy crop switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). Analysis of biomass and survival among 732 resequenced genotypes, which were grown across 10 common gardens that span 1,800 km of latitude, jointly revealed extensive genomic evidence of climate adaptation. Climate-gene-biomass associations were abundant but varied considerably among deeply diverged gene pools. Furthermore, we found that gene flow accelerated climate adaptation during the postglacial colonization of northern habitats through introgression of alleles from a pre-adapted northern gene pool. The polyploid nature of switchgrass also enhanced adaptive potential through the fractionation of gene function, as there was an increased level of heritable genetic diversity on the nondominant subgenome. In addition to investigating patterns of climate adaptation, the genome resources and gene-trait associations developed here provide breeders with the necessary tools to increase switchgrass yield for the sustainable production of bioenergy."], ["Coordinating Ability of Anions, Solvents, Amino Acids, and Gases towards Alkaline and Alkaline-Earth Elements, Transition Metals, and Lanthanides", "After briefly reviewing the applications of the coordination ability indices proposed earlier for anions and solvents toward transition metals and lanthanides, a new analysis of crystal structures is applied now to a much larger number of coordinating species: anions (including those that are present in ionic solvents), solvents, amino acids, gases, and a sample of neutral ligands. The coordinating ability towards s-block elements is now also considered. The effect of several factors on the coordinating ability will be discussed: (a)\u2005the charge of an anion, (b)\u2005the chelating nature of anions and solvents, (c)\u2005the degree of protonation of oxo-anions, carboxylates and amino carboxylates, and (d)\u2005the substitution of hydrogen atoms by methyl groups in NH3, ethylenediamine, benzene, ethylene, pyridine and aldehydes.

A key to success in this novel transformation is the chemoselective S-arylation of S(II) sulfenamides to form S(IV) sulfilimines, overriding the competitive, and more thermodynamically favored, C\u2013N bond formation that does not require a change in the sulfur oxidation state. Computations reveal that the selectivity arises from a selective transmetallation event where bidentate sulfenamide coordination through the sulfur and oxygen atoms favors the S-arylation pathway. The mild and environmentally benign catalytic conditions enable broad functional group compatibility, allowing a variety of diaryl or alkyl aryl sulfilimines to be efficiently prepared. The Chan\u2013Lam coupling procedure could also tolerate alkenylboronic acids as coupling partners to afford alkenyl aryl sulfilimines, a class of scaffolds that cannot be directly synthesized via conventional imination strategies.

The bipolar organization of spindles is essential for proper segregation of chromosomes, and requires plus-end-directed homotetrameric motor proteins of the widely conserved kinesin-5 ( BimC) family(3). Hypotheses for bipolar spindle formation include the 'push-pull mitotic muscle' model, in which kinesin-5 and opposing motor proteins act between overlapping microtubules(2,4,5). However, the precise roles of kinesin-5 during this process are unknown. Here we show that the vertebrate kinesin-5 Eg5 drives the sliding of microtubules depending on their relative orientation. We found in controlled in vitro assays that Eg5 has the remarkable capability of simultaneously moving at similar to 20 nm s(-1) towards the plus-ends of each of the two microtubules it crosslinks. For anti-parallel microtubules, this results in relative sliding at similar to 40 nm s(-1), comparable to spindle pole separation rates in vivo(6). Furthermore, we found that Eg5 can tether microtubule plus-ends, suggesting an additional microtubule-binding mode for Eg5. Our results demonstrate how members of the kinesin-5 family are likely to function in mitosis, pushing apart interpolar microtubules as well as recruiting microtubules into bundles that are subsequently polarized by relative sliding."], ["Ladderphane copolymers for high-temperature capacitive energy storage", "For capacitive energy storage at elevated temperatures(1-4), dielectric polymers are required to integrate low electrical conduction with high thermal conductivity. The coexistence of these seemingly contradictory properties remains a persistent challenge for existing polymers. We describe here a class of ladderphane copolymers exhibiting more than one order of magnitude lower electrical conductivity than the existing polymers at high electric fields and elevated temperatures. Consequently, the ladderphane copolymer possesses a discharged energy density of 5.34 J cm(-3) with a charge-discharge efficiency of 90% at 200 degrees C, outperforming the existing dielectric polymers and composites. The ladderphane copolymers self-assemble into highly ordered arrays by p-p stacking interactions(5,6), thus giving rise to an intrinsic through-plane thermal conductivity of 1.96 +/- 0.06 W m(-1) K-1. The high thermal conductivity of the copolymer film permits efficient Joule heat dissipation and, accordingly, excellent cyclic stability at elevated temperatures and high electric fields. The demonstration of the breakdown self-healing ability of the copolymer further suggests the promise of the ladderphane structures for high-energy-density polymer capacitors operating under extreme conditions."], ["Rigid tightly packed amino acid crystals as functional supramolecular materials", "The formation of ordered nanostructures by metabolites is gaining increased interest due to the simplicity of the building blocks and their natural occurrence. Specifically, aromatic amino acids possess the ability to form ordered supramolecular interactions due to their limited solubility in aqueous solution. Unexpectedly, l-tyrosine (l-Tyr) is almost 2 orders of magnitude less soluble in water compared to l-phenylalanine (l-Phe). However, the underlying mechanism is not fully understood as l-Tyr is more polar. Here, we explore the utilization of insoluble tyrosine assemblies for technological applications and their molecular basis by manipulating the basic building blocks of tightly packed dimers. We show that the addition of an amyloid inhibition agent increases l-Tyr solubility due to the disruption of the dimer formation. The molecular organization grants the l-Tyr crystal higher thermal stability and mechanical properties between three amino acids. Additionally, l-Tyr crystals are shown to generate high and stable piezoelectric power outputs under mechanical pressure in a sandwich device. By incorporating the rigid l-Tyr crystals into a soft polymer, a mechano-responsive bending composite was fabricated. Furthermore, the l-Tyr crystalline needles exhibit an active photowaveguiding property, making them promising candidates for the generation of photonic biomaterial-based devices.

Our analysis provides a robust phylogenomic framework for examining the evolution of green plants. Most inferred species relationships are well supported across multiple species tree and supermatrix analyses, but discordance among plastid and nuclear gene trees at a few important nodes highlights the complexity of plant genome evolution, including polyploidy, periods of rapid speciation, and extinction. Incomplete sorting of ancestral variation, polyploidization and massive expansions of gene families punctuate the evolutionary history of green plants. Notably, we find that large expansions of gene families preceded the origins of green plants, land plants and vascular plants, whereas whole-genome duplications are inferred to have occurred repeatedly throughout the evolution of flowering plants and ferns.

Though the I\u2212/I3\u2212 redox couple has dominated in the last couple of decades, however, due to the loss of open-circuit potential, complementary absorption with a sensitizer and the volatile nature restricts the module development. Metal complexes with variable oxidation states are probable alternative candidates as redox shuttles due to the change in their redox potentials with varying ligands in order to suit different sensitizers.

Increasing the weight ratio of oligomer in the resin system is an effective approach to enhance the mechanical properties, yet the viscosity of the UV-curable resin increases dramatically; this hinders its printing. In this study, a linear scan-based vat photopolymerization (LSVP) system which can print high-viscosity resins is implemented to 3D print the oligomer-dominated UV-curable resin via a dual-curing mechanism. A polyurethane methacrylate blocking oligomer is first synthesized and then mixed with a commercialized bifunctional oligomer, photoinitiator, and primary amine as a chain extender to prepare high-viscosity UV-curable resin for the LSVP system. The deblocked isocyanate is further crosslinked with a chain extender via thermal treatment to construct a highly entangled polymer chain network. The optimal thermal treatment parameters are investigated, and the resilience of the 3D-printed elastomer is evaluated through continuous tensile loading and unloading tests. Subsequently, complex structured elastomers are printed, exhibiting favorable mechanical durability without defects.

This physiological mechanism, termed the 'cholinergic anti- inflammatory pathway'(5) has major implications in immunology and in therapeutics; however, the identity of the essential macrophage acetylcholine-mediated (cholinergic) receptor that responds to vagus nerve signals was previously unknown. Here we report that the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha7 subunit is required for acetylcholine inhibition of macrophage TNF release. Electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve inhibits TNF synthesis in wild-type mice, but fails to inhibit TNF synthesis in alpha7-deficient mice. Thus, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha7 subunit is essential for inhibiting cytokine synthesis by the cholinergic anti- inflammatory pathway."], ["Two-Dimensional Organic\u2013Inorganic Perovskite Ferroelectric Semiconductors with Fluorinated Aromatic Spacers", "Two-dimensional (2D) organic\u2013inorganic perovskites (OIPs), with improved material stability over their 3D counterparts, are highly desirable for device applications.

Current insect-scale (less than ten centimetres long and weighing less than five grams) aerial robots(3-6) use rigid microscale actuators, which are typically fragile under external impact. Biomimetic artificial muscles(7-10) that are capable of large deformation offer a promising alternative for actuation because they can endure the stresses caused by such impacts. However, existing soft actuators(11-13) have not yet demonstrated sufficient power density to achieve lift-off, and their actuation nonlinearity and limited bandwidth create further challenges for achieving closed-loop (driven by an input control signal that is adjusted based on sensory feedback) flight control. Here we develop heavier-than-air aerial robots powered by soft artificial muscles that demonstrate open-loop (driven by a predetermined signal without feedback), passively stable (upright during flight) ascending flight as well as closed-loop, hovering flight. The robots are driven by multi-layered dielectric elastomer actuators that weigh 100 milligrams each and have a resonance frequency of 500 hertz and power density of 600 watts per kilogram. To increase the mechanical power output of the actuator and to demonstrate flight control, we present ways to overcome challenges unique to soft actuators, such as nonlinear transduction and dynamic buckling. These robots can sense and withstand collisions with surrounding obstacles and can recover from in-flight collisions by exploiting material robustness and vehicle passive stability. We also fly two micro-aerial vehicles simultaneously in a cluttered environment. They collide with the wall and each other without suffering damage. These robots rely on offboard amplifiers and an external motion-capture system to provide power to the dielectric elastomer actuators and to control their flight.

Biological N-2 fixation can do this, but the industrial Haber-Bosch process for ammonia production operates under harsh conditions (450 degrees Celsius and 300 bar), even though both processes are thought to involve multimetallic catalytic sites(1,2). And although molecular complexes capable of binding and even reducing N-2 under mild conditions are known, with co-operativity between metal centres considered crucial for the N-2 reduction step(1-14), the multimetallic species involved are usually not well defined, and further transformation of N-2-binding complexes to achieve N-H or N-C bond formation is rare(2,6,8,10,15,16). Haber noted(17), before an iron-based catalyst was adopted for the industrial Haber-Bosch process, that uranium and uranium nitride materials are very effective heterogeneous catalysts for ammonia production from N-2. However, few examples of uranium complexes binding N-2 are known(18-22), and soluble uranium complexes capable of transforming N-2 into ammonia or organonitrogen compounds have not yet been identified. Here we report the four-electron reduction of N-2 under ambient conditions by a fully characterized complex with two U-iii ions and three K+ centres held together by a nitride group and a flexible metalloligand framework. The addition of H-2 and/or protons, or CO to the resulting N-2(4-) complex results in the complete cleavage of N-2 with concomitant N-2 functionalization through N-H or N-C bond-forming reactions. These observations establish that a molecular uranium complex can promote the stoichiometric transformation of N-2 into NH3 or cyanate, and that a flexible, electron-rich, multimetallic, nitride-bridged core unit is a promising starting point for the design of molecular complexes capable of cleaving and functionalizing N-2 under mild conditions."], ["A new method for fast preparation of highly surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) active silver colloids at room temperature by reduction of silver nitrate with hydroxylamine hydrochloride", "A very effective and simple way to produce silver colloids for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is reported.

The effects of a series of LHCEs with model electrolyte solvents (carbonate, sulfone, phosphate, and ether) on the stability of high-voltage LMBs are systematically studied. The stabilities of electrodes in different LHCEs indicate the intrinsic synergistic effects between the salt and the solvent when they coexist on electrode surfaces.

Due attention was given to the interplay between the polymer and perovskite absorber, both within the framework of a bilayer structure and fully assembled solar cells. The obtained results imply that UV degradation exerts a major influence on the structural integrity of PTAA, rather than on the interface with the perovskite light harvester.

We attribute the gels\u2019 toughness to the synergy of two mechanisms: crack bridging by the network of covalent crosslinks, and hysteresis by unzipping the network of ionic crosslinks. Furthermore, the network of covalent crosslinks preserves the memory of the initial state, so that much of the large deformation is removed on unloading.

The histone chaperone known as 'facilitates chromatin transcription' (FACT(1)) (consisting of subunits SPT16 and SSRP1) promotes both disassembly and reassembly of nucleosomes during gene transcription, DNA replication and DNA repair(2). However, the mechanism by which FACT causes these opposing outcomes is unknown. Here we report two cryo-electron-microscopic structures of human FACT in complex with partially assembled subnucleosomes, with supporting biochemical and hydrogen-deuterium exchange data. We find that FACT is engaged in extensive interactions with nucleosomal DNA and all histone variants. The large DNA-binding surface on FACT appears to be protected by the carboxy-terminal domains of both of its subunits, and this inhibition is released by interaction with H2A-H2B, allowing FACT-H2A-H2B to dock onto a complex containing DNA and histones H3 and H4 (ref. (3)). SPT16 binds nucleosomal DNA and tethers H2A-H2B through its carboxy-terminal domain by acting as a placeholder for DNA. SSRP1 also contributes to DNA binding, and can assume two conformations, depending on whether a second H2A-H2B dimer is present. Our data suggest a compelling mechanism for how FACT maintains chromatin integrity during polymerase passage, by facilitating removal of the H2A-H2B dimer, stabilizing intermediate subnucleosomal states and promoting nucleosome reassembly.

A wide range of nucleophiles exhibit SNAr reactivity, and the operational simplicity of the reaction means that the transformation can be conducted reliably and on large scales(2). During SNAr, attack of a nucleophile at a carbon atom bearing a 'leaving group' leads to a negatively charged intermediate called a Meisenheimer complex. Only arenes with electron-withdrawing substituents can sufficiently stabilize the resulting build-up of negative charge during Meisenheimer complex formation, limiting the scope of SNAr reactions: the most common SNAr substrates contain strong p-acceptors in the ortho and/or para position(s)(3.) Here we present an unusual concerted nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction (CSNAr) that is not limited to electron-poor arenes, because it does not proceed via a Meisenheimer intermediate. We show a phenol deoxyfluorination reaction for which CSNAr is favoured over a stepwise displacement. Mechanistic insights enabled us to develop a functional-group-tolerant F-18-deoxyfluorination reaction of phenols, which can be used to synthesize F-18-PET probes. Selective F-18 introduction, without the need for the common, but cumbersome, azeotropic drying of F-18, can now be accomplished from phenols as starting materials, and provides access to F-18-labelled compounds not accessible through conventional chemistry."], ["Direct observation of ultrafast hydrogen bond strengthening in liquid water", "Water is one of the most important, yet least understood, liquids in nature. Many anomalous properties of liquid water originate from its well-connected hydrogen bond network(1), including unusually efficient vibrational energy redistribution and relaxation(2). An accurate description of the ultrafast vibrational motion of water molecules is essential for understanding the nature of hydrogen bonds and many solution-phase chemical reactions. Most existing knowledge of vibrational relaxation in water is built upon ultrafast spectroscopy experiments(2-7). However, these experiments cannot directly resolve the motion of the atomic positions and require difficult translation of spectral dynamics into hydrogen bond dynamics. Here, we measure the ultrafast structural response to the excitation of the OH stretching vibration in liquid water with femtosecond temporal and atomic spatial resolution using liquid ultrafast electron scattering. We observed a transient hydrogen bond contraction of roughly 0.04 angstrom on a timescale of 80 femtoseconds, followed by a thermalization on a timescale of approximately 1 picosecond. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal the need to treat the distribution of the shared proton in the hydrogen bond quantum mechanically to capture the structural dynamics on femtosecond timescales. Our experiment and simulations unveil the intermolecular character of the water vibration preceding the relaxation of the OH stretch. Liquid ultrafast electron scattering measures structural responses in liquid water with femtosecond temporal and atomic spatial resolution to reveal a transient hydrogen bond contraction then thermalization preceding relaxation of the OH stretch."], ["Effect of strain on the reactivity of metal surfaces", "Self-consistent density functional calculations for the adsorption of O and CO, and the dissociation of CO on strained and unstrained Ru(0001) surfaces are used to show how strained metal surfaces have chemical properties that are significantly different from those of unstrained surfaces.

Advances in Electrochemical Science and Engineering, Vol. 11", "The field of chemically modified electrodes has been continuously growing since its establishment approximately three decades ago. This book covers an eclectic set of topics ranging from already classical systems, such as polyelectrolyte-modified electrodes (Chapter 2) and self-assembled monolayers of thiols on gold electrodes (Chapter 5), to relatively recent electrode systems based on nanomaterials. The latter include nanostructured electrodes (Chapter 1), electrodes based on carbon nanotubes (Chapter 3), and surface-attached electroactive nanoparticles (Chapter 4). There is a degree of thematic overlap between Chapters 1 and 3. \nThe range of topics presented in the book is impressive. It includes the interfacing of electrodes with proteins, electrical communication through molecular wires, electrode surfaces with switchable properties, advanced surface patterning, theory and practice of redox polyelectrolyte films, structure and properties of carbon nanotubes and carbon nanotube-based electrodes, faradaic electroactivity of nanoparticles, electrodeposition of metal on self-assembled monolayers, layer-by-layer assembly, amperometric biosensors, immunosensors, DNA sensors, electrochromic devices, electrochemical actuators, and energy-harvesting devices. The latest developments in these areas are nicely presented in the context of older literature. The references are generally thorough\u2014although, perhaps unavoidably, there are some noticeable omissions as mentioned below\u2014and cover the literature up to 2008. The book keeps a satisfying balance between analytical and physical chemistry aspects of the modified electrodes. \nIn addition to the exciting topics covered in this book, there have also been other important developments in this field recently that are not covered here, such as advances in electrodeposition of inorganic films for detection of biomolecules, chitosan-enzyme-based biosensors, molecularly imprinted film electrodes, and multicomponent modified electrodes that display synergistic analytical effects. The reader should also be advised to exercise a degree of caution when reading some of the literature reports on the direct interfacing of electrodes with enzymes. In particular, the claims that the direct electron transfer between the unoriented mats of carbon nanotubes and glucose oxidase provides the basis for mediatorless detection of glucose are not sufficiently supported by relevant control experiments. After all, no commercial modified electrodes have been developed for the mediatorless enzymatic determination of glucose thus far, despite considerable efforts."], ["Perovskite-organic tandem solar cells with indium oxide interconnect", "Multijunction solar cells can overcome the fundamental efficiency limits of single-junction devices. The bandgap tunability of metal halide perovskite solar cells renders them attractive for multijunction architectures(1). Combinations with silicon and copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), as well as all-perovskite tandem cells, have been reported(2-5). Meanwhile, narrow-gap non-fullerene acceptors have unlocked skyrocketing efficiencies for organic solar cells(6,7). Organic and perovskite semiconductors are an attractive combination, sharing similar processing technologies. Currently, perovskite-organic tandems show subpar efficiencies and are limited by the low open-circuit voltage (V-oc) of wide-gap perovskite cells(8) and losses introduced by the interconnect between the subcells(9,10). Here we demonstrate perovskite-organic tandem cells with an efficiency of 24.0 per cent (certified 23.1 per cent) and a high V-oc of 2.15 volts. Optimized charge extraction layers afford perovskite subcells with an outstanding combination of high V-oc and fill factor. The organic subcells provide a high external quantum efficiency in the near-infrared and, in contrast to paradigmatic concerns about limited photostability of non-fullerene cells(11), show an outstanding operational stability if excitons are predominantly generated on the non-fullerene acceptor, which is the case in our tandems. The subcells are connected by an ultrathin (approximately 1.5 nanometres) metal-like indium oxide layer with unprecedented low optical/electrical losses. This work sets a milestone for perovskite-organic tandems, which outperform the best p-i-n perovskite single junctions(12) and are on a par with perovskite-CIGS and all-perovskite multijunctions(13)."], ["N-Boc Amines to Oxazolidinones via Pd(II)/Bis-sulfoxide/Br\u00f8nsted Acid Co-Catalyzed Allylic C\u2013H Oxidation", "A Pd(II)/bis-sulfoxide/Br\u00f8nsted acid catalyzed allylic C\u2013H oxidation reaction for the synthesis of oxazolidinones from simple N-Boc amines is reported.

The high density of crosslinks that gives thermosets their useful properties (for example, chemical and thermal resistance and tensile strength) comes at the expense of degradability and recyclability. Here, using the industrial thermoset polydicyclopentadiene as a model system, we show that when a small number of cleavable bonds are selectively installed within the strands of thermosets using a comonomer additive in otherwise traditional curing workflows, the resulting materials can display the same mechanical properties as the native material, but they can undergo triggered, mild degradation to yield soluble, recyclable products of controlled size and functionality. By contrast, installation of cleavable crosslinks, even at much higher loadings, does not produce degradable materials. These findings reveal that optimization of the cleavable bond location can be used as a design principle to achieve controlled thermoset degradation. Moreover, we introduce a class of recyclable thermosets poised for rapid deployment."], ["DNA-based programmable gate arrays for general-purpose DNA computing", "The past decades have witnessed the evolution of electronic and photonic integrated circuits, from application specific to programmable1,2. Although liquid-phase DNA circuitry holds the potential for massive parallelism in the encoding and execution of algorithms3,4, the development of general-purpose DNA integrated circuits (DICs) has yet to be explored. Here we demonstrate a DIC system by integration of multilayer DNA-based programmable gate arrays (DPGAs). We find that the use of generic single-stranded oligonucleotides as a uniform transmission signal can reliably integrate large-scale DICs with minimal leakage and high fidelity for general-purpose computing. Reconfiguration of a single DPGA with 24 addressable dual-rail gates can be programmed with wiring instructions to implement over 100 billion distinct circuits. Furthermore, to control the intrinsically random collision of molecules, we designed DNA origami registers to provide the directionality for asynchronous execution of cascaded DPGAs. We exemplify this by a quadratic equation-solving DIC assembled with three layers of cascade DPGAs comprising 30 logic gates with around 500 DNA strands. We further show that integration of a DPGA with an analog-to-digital converter can classify disease-related microRNAs.

However, current SDRC systems require stringent surface designs, which are neither cost-effective nor eco-friendly, to selectively emit thermal radiation to outer space and simultaneously maximize solar reflectance. Here, a generic method is developed to upgrade the conventional building-coating materials with a peculiar self-adaptive SDRC effect through combining particle scattering, sunlight-excited fluorescence, and mid-infrared broadband radiation. It is also theoretically proved that heat exchange with the sky can eliminate the use of resonant microstructures and noble metal mirrors in conventional SDRC, and also leads to enhanced daytime cooling yet suppressed nighttime overcooling. When exposed to direct sunlight, the upgraded coating over an aluminum plate can achieve 6 \u00b0C (7 \u00b0C on a scale-model building) below the ambient temperature under a solar intensity of 744 W m-2 (850 W m-2 ), yielding a cooling power of 84.2 W m-2 .

Here we report cost-efficient and site-selective reductive deuteration using a tandem electrochemical chemical palladium membrane reactor. This architecture mediates the chemical reaction of deuterium atoms (derived from reusable D2O in an electrochemical compartment) with alkynes, aldehydes and imines. The formation of C(sp3)\u2013D and C(sp2)\u2013D bonds in the isolated chemical compartment is made possible by the deuterium-selective permeability of the membrane that partitions the electrochemical compartment from the chemical compartment.

Prominent examples include the anomalous quantization of magneto-electric coupling(4-6), half-fermion states that are their own antiparticle(7,8), and charge fractionalization in a Bose-Einstein condensate(9), all of which are not possible with conventional Dirac fermions of the graphene variety(10). Helical Dirac fermions have so far remained elusive owing to the lack of necessary spin-sensitive measurements and because such fermions are forbidden to exist in conventional materials harbouring relativistic electrons, such as graphene(10) or bismuth(11). It has recently been proposed that helical Dirac fermions may exist at the edges of certain types of topologically ordered insulators(3,4,12)-materials with a bulk insulating gap of spin-orbit origin and surface states protected against scattering by time-reversal symmetry-and that their peculiar properties may be accessed provided the insulator is tuned into the so-called topological transport regime(3-9). However, helical Dirac fermions have not been observed in existing topological insulators(13-18). Here we report the realization and characterization of a tunable topological insulator in a bismuth-based class of material by combining spin-imaging and momentum-resolved spectroscopies, bulk charge compensation, Hall transport measurements and surface quantum control. Our results reveal a spin-momentum locked Dirac cone carrying a non-trivial Berry's phase that is nearly 100 per cent spin-polarized, which exhibits a tunable topological fermion density in the vicinity of the Kramers point and can be driven to the long-sought topological spin transport regime.

With accessible FeN2S2 active sites on mesoporous graphene, the catalyst serves to promote transport of electrolyte, oxygen and electron and confines the growth of ZnO2, which would otherwise form dead products.

This structural motif is unusually consistent across all species from all geological eras(4-6). Such invariability-especially when juxtaposed with the diversity of other tissues-suggests the existence of a functional basis. Here we performed ex vivo replication of enamel-inspired columnar nanocomposites by sequential growth of zinc oxide nanowire carpets followed by layer-by-layer deposition of a polymeric matrix around these. We show that the mechanical properties of these nanocomposites, including hardness, are comparable to those of enamel despite the nanocomposites having a smaller hard-phase content. Our abiotic enamels have viscoelastic figures of merit (VFOM) and weight-adjusted VFOM that are similar to, or higher than, those of natural tooth enamels-we achieve values that exceed the traditional materials limits of 0.6 and 0.8, respectively. VFOM values describe resistance to vibrational damage, and our columnar composites demonstrate that lightweight materials of unusually high resistance to structural damage from shocks, environmental vibrations and oscillatory stress can be made using biomimetic design. The previously inaccessible combinations of high stiffness, damping and light weight that we achieve in these layer-by-layer composites are attributed to efficient energy dissipation in the interfacial portion of the organic phase. The in vivo contribution of this interfacial portion to macroscale deformations along the tooth's normal is maximized when the architecture is columnar, suggesting an evolutionary advantage of the columnar motif in the enamel of living species.

In plants, an unanticipated decline in oxygen availability (hypoxia), as caused by roots becoming waterlogged or foliage submergence, triggers changes in gene transcription and messenger RNA translation that promote anaerobic metabolism and thus sustain substrate-level ATP production(1). In contrast to animals(2), oxygen sensing has not been ascribed to a mechanism of gene regulation in response to oxygen deprivation in plants. Here we show that the N-end rule pathway of targeted proteolysis acts as a homeostatic sensor of severe low oxygen levels in Arabidopsis, through its regulation of key hypoxia-response transcription factors. We found that plants lacking components of the N-end rule pathway constitutively express core hypoxia-response genes and are more tolerant of hypoxic stress. We identify the hypoxia-associated ethylene response factor group VII transcription factors of Arabidopsis as substrates of this pathway. Regulation of these proteins by the N-end rule pathway occurs through a characteristic conserved motif at the amino terminus initiating with Met-Cys. Enhanced stability of one of these proteins, HRE2, under low oxygen conditions improves hypoxia survival and reveals a molecular mechanism for oxygen sensing in plants via the evolutionarily conserved N-end rule pathway. SUB1A-1, a major determinant of submergence tolerance in rice(3), was shown not to be a substrate for the N-end rule pathway despite containing the N-terminal motif, indicating that it is uncoupled from N-end rule pathway regulation, and that enhanced stability may relate to the superior tolerance of Sub1 rice varieties to multiple abiotic stresses(4)."], ["De-ubiquitination and ubiquitin ligase domains of A20 downregulate NF-\u03baB signalling", "NF-kappaB transcription factors mediate the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta(1). Failure to downregulate NF-kappaB transcriptional activity results in chronic inflammation and cell death, as observed in A20-deficient mice(2). A20 is a potent inhibitor of NF-kappaB signalling, but its mechanism of action is unknown(2). Here we show that A20 downregulates NF-kappaB signalling through the cooperative activity of its two ubiquitin-editing domains. The amino-terminal domain of A20, which is a de-ubiquitinating (DUB) enzyme of the OTU (ovarian tumour) family(3), removes lysine-63 (K63)-linked ubiquitin chains from receptor interacting protein ( RIP), an essential mediator of the proximal TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) signalling complex(4,5). The carboxy-terminal domain of A20, composed of seven C-2/C-2 zinc fingers(6), then functions as a ubiquitin ligase by polyubiquitinating RIP with K48-linked ubiquitin chains, thereby targeting RIP for proteasomal degradation. Here we define a novel ubiquitin ligase domain and identify two sequential mechanisms by which A20 downregulates NF-kappaB signalling. We also provide an example of a protein containing separate ubiquitin ligase and DUB domains, both of which participate in mediating a distinct regulatory effect."], ["Are they linear, bent, or cyclic?

The carbon compound lin-HCN (HCN=hydrogen cyanide) is 14.9 kcal mol(-1) lower in energy than lin-HNC but the heavier group 14 homologues lin-HEN (E=Si-Pb) are between 64.8 and 71.5 kcal mol(-1) less stable than the lin-HNE isomers. The phosphorous system (H, P, E) exhibits significant differences concerning the geometry and stability of the equilibrium structures compared with the nitrogen system. The linear form lin-HEP of the former system is much more stable than lin-HPE. The molecule lin-HCP is the only minimum on the singlet PES. It is 78.5 kcal mol(-1) lower in energy than lin-HPC, which is a second-order saddle point. The heavier homologues lin-HPE, in which E=Si-Pb, are also second-order saddle points, whereas the bent-HPE structures are the global minima on the PES.

The drastic energy differences between the isomers of the system (H, X, E) are explained with three factors that determine the relative stabilities of the energy minima: 1) The different bond strength between the hydrogen bonds H-X and H-E. 2) The electronic excitation energy of the fragment HE from the X (2)\u03a0 ground state to the (4)\u03a3(-) excited state, which is required to establish a E\u2261X triple bond in the molecules lin-HEX. 3) The strength of the intrinsic X-E interactions in the molecules.

No known nitrifier carries out both steps, although complete nitrification should be energetically advantageous. This functional separation has puzzled microbiologists for a century. Here we report on the discovery and cultivation of a completely nitrifying bacterium from the genus Nitrospira, a globally distributed group of nitrite oxidizers. The genome of this chemolithoautotrophic organism encodes the pathways both for ammonia and nitrite oxidation, which are concomitantly expressed during growth by ammonia oxidation to nitrate. Genes affiliated with the phylogenetically distinct ammonia monooxygenase and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase genes of Nitrospira are present in many environments and were retrieved on Nitrospira-contigs in new metagenomes from engineered systems.

This group of materials has received much interest owing to their enhanced mechanical properties. They are usually called medium-entropy alloys in ternary systems and high-entropy alloys in quaternary or quinary systems, alluding to their high degree of configurational entropy. However, the question has remained as to how random these solid solutions actually are, with the influence of short-range order being suggested in computational simulations but not seen experimentally6,7. Here we report the observation, using energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy, of structural features attributable to short-range order in the CrCoNi medium-entropy alloy.

G-protein-coupled receptors are the largest class of cell surface receptors and are important drug targets. A molecular understanding of their activation mechanism is critical for drug discovery and design. However, direct evidence that addresses how agonist binding leads to the formation of an active receptor state is scarce(3). Here we use F-19 nuclear magnetic resonance to quantify the conformational landscape occupied by the adenosine A(2A) receptor (A(2A)R), a prototypical class A G-protein-coupled receptor. We find an ensemble of four states in equilibrium: (1) two inactive states in millisecond exchange, consistent with a formed (state S-1) and a broken (state S-2) salt bridge (known as 'ionic lock') between transmembrane helices 3 and 6; and (2) two active states, S-3 and S-3', as identified by binding of a G-protein-derived peptide. In contrast to a recent study of the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor(4), the present approach allowed identification of a second active state for A(2A)R. Addition of inverse agonist (ZM241385) increases the population of the inactive states, while full agonists (UK432097 or NECA) stabilize the active state, S-3', in a manner consistent with conformational selection. In contrast, partial agonist (LUF5834) and an allosteric modulator (HMA) exclusively increase the population of the S-3 state. Thus, partial agonism is achieved here by conformational selection of a distinct active state which we predict will have compromised coupling to the G protein.

Covalent adaptable networks (CAN)s, which incorporate reversible or dynamic covalent bonding, have emerged as an efficient means to afford reprocessable crosslinked materials and increasing the feedstock sustainability of CANs is a developing aim. In this study, the biomass-derived lipoic acid, which possesses a dynamic cyclic disulfide moiety, was transformed into a series of bifunctional monomers via a one-step esterification or amidation reaction and reacted with a commercially available multi-valent thiol in the presence of an organobase catalyst to afford dynamically crosslinked networks.

This result is consistent with other reports from laser activation of HOPG,which correlate increased edge plane density with increased electron-transfer rate. Creation of edge planeis a phenomenon common to both oxidative and nonoxidative activation procedures and is responsiblefor HOPG activation. Arguments about the involvement of graphitic oxide or oxygen containing functionalgroups in electron-transfer activation are presented. After the present results are combined with thosefrom the literature, it appears unlikely that oxygen functional groups are involved in electron-transferactivation of several benchmark redox systems on carbon electrodes."], ["Uses of K2S2O8 in Metal-Catalyzed and Metal-Free Oxidative Transformations", "Carbon\u2013carbon/carbon\u2013heteroatom bond formation via oxidative transformations is a heavily explored topic at the frontier of chemistry. Potassium persulfate (K2S2O8) has emerged as a cost-effective, suitable inorganic oxidant for a wide array of oxidative transformations, ranging from laboratory experiments to industrial processes. The current review provides a comprehensive coverage of oxidative transformations aided with K2S2O8 in the presence or absence of a transition-metal catalyst, critical assessment of the results, and underlying mechanisms. Organic chemists may find this review to be a useful guide for the expedient synthesis of new chemical entities, to formulate mechanistic manifolds involving the sulfate radical anion, or to design novel oxidative transformations. A detailed understanding of the unsolved mechanisms could further enrich the field."], ["Detection of N(4S) by resonantly enhanced multiphoton ionizanon spectroscopy", "We report the first instance of detection of N(4S) atoms by Resonantly Enhanced Multiphoton Ionization (REMPI). The magnitude of the ion signal, after correction for laser power dependence, is directly proportional to the N(4S) concentration and, once calibrated, is a direct and highly sensitive method for N(4S) concentration measurements in fast-flow kinetics experiments."], ["Scalable anisotropic cooling aerogels by additive freeze-casting", "Cooling in buildings is vital to human well-being but inevitability consumes significant energy, adding pressure on achieving carbon neutrality. Thermally superinsulating aerogels are promising to isolate the heat for more energy-efficient cooling. However, most aerogels tend to absorb the sunlight for unwanted solar heat gain, and it is challenging to scale up the aerogel fabrication while maintaining consistent properties. Herein, we develop a thermally insulating, solar-reflective anisotropic cooling aerogel panel containing in-plane aligned pores with engineered pore walls using boron nitride nanosheets by an additive freeze-casting technique. The additive freeze-casting offers highly controllable and cumulative freezing dynamics for fabricating decimeter-scale aerogel panels with consistent in-plane pore alignments. The unique anisotropic thermo-optical properties of the nanosheets combined with in-plane pore channels enable the anisotropic cooling aerogel to deliver an ultralow out-of-plane thermal conductivity of 16.9\u2009mW\u2009m\u22121 K\u22121 and a high solar reflectance of 97%. The excellent dual functionalities allow the anisotropic cooling aerogel to minimize both parasitic and solar heat gains when used as cooling panels under direct sunlight, achieving an up to 7\u2009\u00b0C lower interior temperature than commercial silica aerogels. This work offers a new paradigm for the bottom-up fabrication of scalable anisotropic aerogels towards practical energy-efficient cooling applications."], ["Comparative study on confinement effects of graphene and graphene oxide on structure and dynamics of water", "In this work, we compared the structural and dynamical properties of water confined between two graphene oxide (GO) sheets with water confined between two graphene sheets through molecular dynamics simulations. Our results showed how the structure and dynamics of the water near the GO surfaces changes under confinement conditions. Different orientations of the water molecules to the GO sheets confirm the heterogeneous nature of the confined water. The density distribution of water near the GO sheets is different from the graphene surfaces due to the presence of hydrophilic functional groups of the GO sheets. Also, the hydrogen bonds between the water molecules are disturbed due to the presence of these groups on the GO surfaces. The results showed that as water molecules in areas which are close to the GO surfaces are isolated, and due to hydrogen bond formation between water molecules and the substituents of the GO, the water molecules have fewer hydrogen bonds with other water molecules around. In the middle region between two GO sheets, it has been seen that each water molecule is surrounded by more water molecules, and there are many more hydrogen bonds, so it is possible to consider a network structure of water in this region. There is a good quantitative agreement between experiments and the above mentioned results. These results were confirmed by the calculated coordination number, radial distribution functions and mean square displacements."], ["Functional materials discovery using energy\u2013structure\u2013function maps", "Molecular crystals cannot be designed in the same manner as macroscopic objects, because they do not assemble according to simple, intuitive rules. Their structures result from the balance of many weak interactions, rather than from the strong and predictable bonding patterns found in metal\u2013organic frameworks and covalent organic frameworks. Hence, design strategies that assume a topology or other structural blueprint will often fail. Here we combine computational crystal structure prediction and property prediction to build energy\u2013structure\u2013function maps that describe the possible structures and properties that are available to a candidate molecule. Using these maps, we identify a highly porous solid, which has the lowest density reported for a molecular crystal so far. Both the structure of the crystal and its physical properties, such as methane storage capacity and guest-molecule selectivity, are predicted using the molecular structure as the only input. More generally, energy\u2013structure\u2013function maps could be used to guide the experimental discovery of materials with any target function that can be calculated from predicted crystal structures, such as electronic structure or mechanical properties."], ["The Chemistry of CO: Carbonylation", "Carbon monoxide is one of the most important C1 molecules in organic chemistry. Many novel procedures for its conversion have been developed, and some have even been industrialized. In this review, we discuss and categorize CO chemistry into four classes: (1) transition-metal-mediated carbonylation, (2) strong-acid-initiated cationic carbonylation, (3) anionic carbonylation, and (4) free-radical carbonylation. Relevant achievements are selected and discussed in detail."], ["Past, present, and future of lead\u2013acid batteries", "When Gaston Plant\u00e9 invented the lead\u2013acid battery more than 160 years ago, he could not have foreseen it spurring a multibillion-dollar industry. Despite an apparently low energy density\u201430 to 40% of the theoretical limit versus 90% for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs)\u2014lead\u2013acid batteries are made from abundant low-cost materials and nonflammable water-based electrolyte, while manufacturing practices that operate at 99% recycling rates substantially minimize environmental impact (1). Nevertheless, forecasts of the demise of lead\u2013acid batteries (2) have focused on the health effects of lead and the rise of LIBs (2). A large gap in technological advancements should be seen as an opportunity for scientific engagement to expand the scope of lead\u2013acid batteries into power grid applications, which currently lack a single energy storage technology with optimal technical and economic performance."], ["X-ray analysis on the nanogram to microgram scale using porous complexes", "X-ray single-crystal diffraction (SCD) analysis has the intrinsic limitation that the target molecules must be obtained as single crystals. Here we report a protocol for SCD analysis that does not require the crystallization of the sample. In our method, tiny crystals of porous complexes are soaked in a solution of the target, such that the complexes can absorb the target molecules. Crystallographic analysis clearly determines the absorbed guest structures along with the host frameworks. Because the SCD analysis is carried out on only one tiny crystal of the complex, the required sample mass is of the nanogram-microgram order. We demonstrate that as little as about 80 nanograms of a sample is enough for the SCD analysis. In combination with high-performance liquid chromatography, our protocol allows the direct characterization of multiple fractions, establishing a prototypical means of liquid chromatography SCD analysis. Furthermore, we unambiguously determined the structure of a scarce marine natural product using only 5 micrograms of the compound."], ["Catalytic, Stereoselective Dihalogenation of Alkenes: Challenges and Opportunities", "Although recent years have witnessed significant advances in the development of catalytic, enantioselective halofunctionalizations of alkenes, the related dihalogenation of olefins to afford enantioenriched vicinal dihalide products remains comparatively underdeveloped. However, the growing number of complex natural products bearing halogen atoms at stereogenic centers has underscored this critical gap in the synthetic chemist\u2019s arsenal. This Review highlights the selectivity challenges inherent in the design of enantioselective dihalogenation processes, and formulates a mechanism-based classification of alkene dihalogenations, including those that may circumvent the \u201cclassical\u201d haliranium (or alkene-dihalogen \u03c0-complex) intermediates. A variety of metal and main group halide reagents that have been used for the dichlorination or dibromination of alkenes are discussed, and the proposed mechanisms of these transformations are critically evaluated."], ["Regioselective and Stereospecific Deuteration of Bioactive AzaCompounds by the Use of Ruthenium Nanoparticles", "An efficient H/D exchange method allowing the deuteration of pyridines, quinolines, indoles, and alkyl amines with D2 in the presence of Ru@PVP nanoparticles is described. By a general and simple procedure involving mild reaction conditions and simple filtration to recover the labeled product, the isotopic labeling of 22 compounds proceeded in good yield with high chemo- and regioselectivity. The viability of this procedure was demonstrated by the labeling of eight biologically active compounds. Remarkably, enantiomeric purity was conserved in the labeled compounds, even though labeling took place in the vicinity of the stereogenic center. The level of isotopic enrichment observed is suitable for metabolomic studies in most cases. This approach is also perfectly adapted to tritium labeling because it uses a gas as an isotopic source. Besides these applications to molecules of biological interest, this study reveals a rich and underestimated chemistry on the surface of ruthenium nanoparticles."], ["Effect of solvation shell structure on thermopower of liquid redox pairs", "Recent advancements in thermogalvanic batteries offer a promising route to efficient harvesting of low-grade heat with temperatures below 100 \u00b0C. The thermogalvanic temperature coefficient {\u0007lpha}, usually referred to as effective thermopower, is the key parameter determining the power density and efficiency of thermogalvanic batteries. However, the current understanding of improving {\u0007lpha} of redox pairs remains at the phenomenological level without microscopic insights, and the development of electrolytes with high {\u0007lpha} largely relies on experimental trial and error. This work applies the free energy perturbation method based on molecular dynamics simulations to predict the {\u0007lpha} of the {Fe^{3+}/Fe^{2+}} redox pair in aqueous and acetone solutions. We showed that {\u0007lpha} of the {Fe^{3+}/Fe^{2+}} redox pair can be increased from 1.5{\\pm}0.3 mV/K to 4.1{\\pm}0.4 mV/K with the increased acetone to water fraction. The predicted {\u0007lpha} of {Fe^{3+}/Fe^{2+}} both in pure water and acetone show excellent agreement with experimental values. By monitoring the fluctuation of dipole orientations in the first solvation shell, we discovered a significant change in the variance of solvent dipole orientation between Fe^{3+} and Fe^{2+}, which can be a microscopic indicator for large magnitudes of {\u0007lpha}. The effect of acetone weight fraction in the mixed acetone-water solvent on the {\u0007lpha} of {Fe^{3+}/Fe^{2+}} is also studied. Acetone molecules are found to intercalate into the first solvation shell of the {Fe^{2+}} ion at high acetone fractions, while this phenomenon is not observed in the solvation shell of the Fe^{3+} ion. Such solvation shell structure change of {Fe^{2+}} ions contributes to the enhanced {\u0007lpha} at high acetone fractions. Our discovery provides atomistic insights into how solvation shell order can be leveraged to develop electrolytes with high thermopower."], ["Metal-free visible light photoredox enables generation of carbyne equivalents via phosphonium ylide C\u2013H activation", "Carbyne, an interesting synthetic intermediate, has recently been generated from hypervalent iodine precursors via photoredox catalysis. Given the underexplored chemistry of carbyne, due to the paucity of carbyne sources, we are intrigued to discover a new source for this reactive species from classical reagents \u2013 phosphonium ylides. Our novel strategy employing phosphonium ylides in an olefin hydrocarbonation reaction features a facile approach for constructing carbon\u2013carbon bonds through metal-free and benign reaction conditions. Moreover, the hydrocarbonation products were delivered in a highly regioselective manner."], ["Integrative analysis of 111 reference human epigenomes", "The reference human genome sequence set the stage for studies of genetic variation and its association with human disease, but epigenomic studies lack a similar reference. To address this need, the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium generated the largest collection so far of human epigenomes for primary cells and tissues. Here we describe the integrative analysis of 111 reference human epigenomes generated as part of the programme, profiled for histone modification patterns, DNA accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression. We establish global maps of regulatory elements, define regulatory modules of coordinated activity, and their likely activators and repressors. We show that disease- and trait-associated genetic variants are enriched in tissue-specific epigenomic marks, revealing biologically relevant cell types for diverse human traits, and providing a resource for interpreting the molecular basis of human disease. Our results demonstrate the central role of epigenomic information for understanding gene regulation, cellular differentiation and human disease."]]
