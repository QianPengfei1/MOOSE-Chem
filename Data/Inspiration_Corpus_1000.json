[["The <i>Ectocarpus</i> genome and the independent evolution of multicellularity in brown algae", "Brown algae (Phaeophyceae) are complex photosynthetic organisms with a very different evolutionary history to green plants, to which they are only distantly related(1). These seaweeds are the dominant species in rocky coastal ecosystems and they exhibit many interesting adaptations to these, often harsh, environments. Brown algae are also one of only a small number of eukaryotic lineages that have evolved complex multicellularity (Fig. 1). We report the 214 million base pair (Mbp) genome sequence of the filamentous seaweed Ectocarpus siliculosus (Dillwyn) Lyngbye, a model organism for brown algae(2-5), closely related to the kelps(6,7) (Fig. 1). Genome features such as the presence of an extended set of light-harvesting and pigment biosynthesis genes and new metabolic processes such as halide metabolism help explain the ability of this organism to cope with the highly variable tidal environment. The evolution of multicellularity in this lineage is correlated with the presence of a rich array of signal transduction genes. Of particular interest is the presence of a family of receptor kinases, as the independent evolution of related molecules has been linked with the emergence of multicellularity in both the animal and green plant lineages. The Ectocarpus genome sequence represents an important step towards developing this organism as a model species, providing the possibility to combine genomic and genetic(2) approaches to explore these and other(4,5) aspects of brown algal biology further."], ["X-ray structure of a CIC chloride channel at 3.0 \u00c5 reveals the molecular basis of anion selectivity", "The ClC chloride channels catalyse the selective flow of Cl- ions across cell membranes, thereby regulating electrical excitation in skeletal muscle and the flow of salt and water across epithelial barriers. Genetic defects in ClC Cl- channels underlie several familial muscle and kidney diseases. Here we present the X-ray structures of two prokaryotic ClC Cl- channels from Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and Escherichia coli at 3.0 and 3.5 Angstrom, respectively. Both structures reveal two identical pores, each pore being formed by a separate subunit contained within a homodimeric membrane protein. Individual subunits are composed of two roughly repeated halves that span the membrane with opposite orientations. This antiparallel architecture defines a selectivity filter in which a Cl- ion is stabilized by electrostatic interactions with a-helix dipoles and by chemical coordination with nitrogen atoms and hydroxyl groups. These findings provide a structural basis for further understanding the function of ClC Cl- channels, and establish the physical and chemical basis of their anion selectivity."], ["Genome sequence of enterohaemorrhagic <i>Escherichia coli</i> O157:H7", "The bacterium Escherichia coli O157:H7 is a worldwide threat to public health and has been implicated in many outbreaks of haemorrhagic colitis, some of which included fatalities caused by haemolytic uraemic syndrome(1,2). Close to 75,000 cases of O157:H7 infection are now estimated to occur annually in the United States(3). The severity of disease, the lack of effective treatment and the potential for large-scale outbreaks from contaminated food supplies have propelled intensive research on the pathogenesis and detection of E. coli O157:H7 (ref. 4). Here we have sequenced the genome of E. coli O157:H7 to identify candidate genes responsible for pathogenesis, to develop better methods of strain detection and to advance our understanding of the evolution of E. coli, through comparison with the genome of the non-pathogenic laboratory strain E. coli K-12 (ref. 5). We rnd that lateral gene transfer is far more extensive than previously anticipated. In fact, 1,387 new genes encoded in strain-specific clusters of diverse sizes were found in O157:H7. These include candidate virulence factors, alternative metabolic capacities, several prophages and other new functions-all of which could be targets for surveillance."], ["Sound and heat revolutions in phononics", "The phonon is the physical particle representing mechanical vibration and is responsible for the transmission of everyday sound and heat. Understanding and controlling the phononic properties of materials provides opportunities to thermally insulate buildings, reduce environmental noise, transform waste heat into electricity and develop earthquake protection. Here I review recent progress and the development of new ideas and devices that make use of phononic properties to control both sound and heat. Advances in sonic and thermal diodes, optomechanical crystals, acoustic and thermal cloaking, hypersonic phononic crystals, thermoelectrics, and thermocrystals herald the next technological revolution in phononics."], ["Coordinating Ability of Anions, Solvents, Amino Acids, and Gases towards Alkaline and Alkaline-Earth Elements, Transition Metals, and Lanthanides", "After briefly reviewing the applications of the coordination ability indices proposed earlier for anions and solvents toward transition metals and lanthanides, a new analysis of crystal structures is applied now to a much larger number of coordinating species: anions (including those that are present in ionic solvents), solvents, amino acids, gases, and a sample of neutral ligands. The coordinating ability towards s-block elements is now also considered. The effect of several factors on the coordinating ability will be discussed: (a)\u2005the charge of an anion, (b)\u2005the chelating nature of anions and solvents, (c)\u2005the degree of protonation of oxo-anions, carboxylates and amino carboxylates, and (d)\u2005the substitution of hydrogen atoms by methyl groups in NH3, ethylenediamine, benzene, ethylene, pyridine and aldehydes. Hit parades of solvents and anions most commonly used in the areas of transition metal, s-block and lanthanide chemistry are deduced from the statistics of their presence in crystal structures."], ["Five carbon- and nitrogen-bearing species in a hot giant planet's atmosphere", "The atmospheres of gaseous giant exoplanets orbiting close to their parent stars (hot Jupiters) have been probed for nearly two decades(1,2). They allow us to investigate the chemical and physical properties of planetary atmospheres under extreme irradiation conditions(3). Previous observations of hot Jupiters as they transit in front of their host stars have revealed the frequent presence of water vapour(4) and carbon monoxide(5) in their atmospheres; this has been studied in terms of scaled solar composition(6) under the usual assumption of chemical equilibrium. Both molecules as well as hydrogen cyanide were found in the atmosphere of HD 209458b(5,7,8), a well studied hot Jupiter (with equilibrium temperature around 1,500 kelvin), whereas ammonia was tentatively detected there(9) and subsequently refuted(10). Here we report observations of HD 209458b that indicate the presence of water (H2O), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen cyanide (HCN), methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3) and acetylene (C2H2), with statistical significance of 5.3 to 9.9 standard deviations per molecule. Atmospheric models in radiative and chemical equilibrium that account for the detected species indicate a carbon-rich chemistry with a carbon-to-oxygen ratio close to or greater than 1, higher than the solar value (0.55). According to existing models relating the atmospheric chemistry to planet formation and migration scenarios(3,11,12), this would suggest that HD 209458b formed far from its present location and subsequently migrated inwards(11,13). Other hot Jupiters may also show a richer chemistry than has been previously found, which would bring into question the frequently made assumption that they have solar-like and oxygen-rich compositions."], ["The endogenous cannabinoid system controls extinction of aversive memories", "Acquisition and storage of aversive memories is one of the basic principles of central nervous systems throughout the animal kingdom(1). In the absence of reinforcement, the resulting behavioural response will gradually diminish to be finally extinct. Despite the importance of extinction(2), its cellular mechanisms are largely unknown. The cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1)(3) and endocannabinoids(4) are present in memory-related brain areas(5,6) and modulate memory(7,8). Here we show that the endogenous cannabinoid system has a central function in extinction of aversive memories. CB1-deficient mice showed strongly impaired short-term and long-term extinction in auditory fear-conditioning tests, with unaffected memory acquisition and consolidation. Treatment of wild-type mice with the CB1 antagonist SR141716A mimicked the phenotype of CB1-deficient mice, revealing that CB1 is required at the moment of memory extinction. Consistently, tone presentation during extinction trials resulted in elevated levels of endocannabinoids in the basolateral amygdala complex,a region known to control extinction of aversive memories(9). In the basolateral amygdala, endocannabinoids and CB1 were crucially involved in long-term depression of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)-mediated inhibitory currents. We propose that endocannabinoids facilitate extinction of aversive memories through their selective inhibitory effects on local inhibitory networks in the amygdala."], ["Comparative study on confinement effects of graphene and graphene oxide on structure and dynamics of water", "In this work, we compared the structural and dynamical properties of water confined between two graphene oxide (GO) sheets with water confined between two graphene sheets through molecular dynamics simulations. Our results showed how the structure and dynamics of the water near the GO surfaces changes under confinement conditions. Different orientations of the water molecules to the GO sheets confirm the heterogeneous nature of the confined water. The density distribution of water near the GO sheets is different from the graphene surfaces due to the presence of hydrophilic functional groups of the GO sheets. Also, the hydrogen bonds between the water molecules are disturbed due to the presence of these groups on the GO surfaces. The results showed that as water molecules in areas which are close to the GO surfaces are isolated, and due to hydrogen bond formation between water molecules and the substituents of the GO, the water molecules have fewer hydrogen bonds with other water molecules around. In the middle region between two GO sheets, it has been seen that each water molecule is surrounded by more water molecules, and there are many more hydrogen bonds, so it is possible to consider a network structure of water in this region. There is a good quantitative agreement between experiments and the above mentioned results. These results were confirmed by the calculated coordination number, radial distribution functions and mean square displacements."], ["Required growth facilitators propel axon regeneration across complete spinal cord injury", "Transected axons fail to regrow across anatomically complete spinal cord injuries (SCI) in adults. Diverse molecules can partially facilitate or attenuate axon growth during development or after injury(1-3), but efficient reversal of this regrowth failure remains elusive(4). Here we show that three factors that are essential for axon growth during development but are attenuated or lacking in adults- (i) neuron intrinsic growth capacity(2,5-9), (ii) growth-supportive substrate(10,11) and (iii) chemoattraction(12)(,13)-are all individually required and, in combination, are sufficient to stimulate robust axon regrowth across anatomically complete SCI lesions in adult rodents. We reactivated the growth capacity of mature descending propriospinal neurons with osteopontin, insulin-like growth factor 1 and ciliary-derived neurotrophic factor before SCI14,15; induced growth-supportive substrates with fibroblast growth factor 2 and epidermal growth factor; and chemoattracted propriospinal axons with glial-derived neurotrophic factor(16,17) delivered via spatially and temporally controlled release from biomaterial depots(18,19), placed sequentially after SCI. We show in both mice and rats that providing these three mechanisms in combination, but not individually, stimulated robust propriospinal axon regrowth through astrocyte scar borders and across lesion cores of non-neural tissue that was over 100-fold greater than controls. Stimulated, supported and chemoattracted propriospinal axons regrew a full spinal segment beyond lesion centres, passed well into spared neural tissue, formed terminal-like contacts exhibiting synaptic markers and conveyed a significant return of electrophysiological conduction capacity across lesions. Thus, overcoming the failure of axon regrowth across anatomically complete SCI lesions after maturity required the combined sequential reinstatement of several developmentally essential mechanisms that facilitate axon growth. These findings identify a mechanism-based biological repair strategy for complete SCI lesions that could be suitable to use with rehabilitation models designed to augment the functional recovery of remodelling circuits."], ["Universal quantum computation with the exchange interaction", "Various physical implementations of quantum computers are being investigated, although the requirements(1) that must be met to make such devices a reality in the laboratory at present involve capabilities well beyond the state of the art. Recent solid-state approaches have used quantum dots(2), donor-atom nuclear spins(3) or electron spins(4); in these architectures, the basic two-qubit quantum gate is generated by a tunable exchange interaction between spins (a Heisenberg interaction), whereas the one-qubit gates require control over a local magnetic field. Compared to the Heisenberg operation, the one-qubit operations are significantly slower, requiring substantially greater materials and device complexity-potentially contributing to a detrimental increase in the decoherence rate. Here we introduced an explicit scheme in which the Heisenberg interaction alone suffices to implement exactly any quantum computer circuit. This capability comes at a price of a factor of three in additional qubits, and about a factor of ten in additional two-qubit operations. Even at this cost, the ability to eliminate the complexity of one-qubit operations should accelerate progress towards solid-state implementations of quantum computation(1)."], ["Trapping the dynamic acyl carrier protein in fatty acid biosynthesis", "Acyl carrier protein (ACP) transports the growing fatty acid chain between enzymatic domains of fatty acid synthase (FAS) during biosynthesis(1). Because FAS enzymes operate on ACP-bound acyl groups, ACP must stabilize and transport the growing lipid chain(2). ACPs have a central role in transporting starting materials and intermediates throughout the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway(3-5). The transient nature of ACP-enzyme interactions impose major obstacles to obtaining high-resolution structural information about fatty acid biosynthesis, and a new strategy is required to study protein-protein interactions effectively. Here we describe the application of a mechanism-based probe that allows active site-selective covalent crosslinking of AcpP to FabA, the Escherichia coli ACP and fatty acid 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase, respectively. We report the 1.9 angstrom crystal structure of the crosslinked AcpP-FabA complex as a homodimer in which AcpP exhibits two different conformations, representing probable snapshots of ACP in action: the 4'-phosphopantetheine group of AcpP first binds an arginine-rich groove of FabA, then an AcpP helical conformational change locks AcpP and FabA in place. Residues at the interface of AcpP and FabA are identified and validated by solution nuclear magnetic resonance techniques, including chemical shift perturbations and residual dipolar coupling measurements. These not only support our interpretation of the crystal structures but also provide an animated view of ACP in action during fatty acid dehydration. These techniques, in combination with molecular dynamics simulations, show for the first time that FabA extrudes the sequestered acyl chain from the ACP binding pocket before dehydration by repositioning helix III. Extensive sequence conservation among carrier proteins suggests that the mechanistic insights gleaned from our studies may be broadly applicable to fatty acid, polyketide and non-ribosomal biosynthesis. Here the foundation is laid for defining the dynamic action of carrier-protein activity in primary and secondary metabolism, providing insight into pathways that can have major roles in the treatment of cancer, obesity and infectious disease."], ["Carbynes reloaded: Isolation of singlet metallocarbenes", "Metallocarbenes are the elusive electromers of the well-established carbyne complexes with subvalent carbon ligands.

Here, we report the results of an international collaboration to produce a high-quality draft sequence of the mouse genome. We also present an initial comparative analysis of the mouse and human genomes, describing some of the insights that can be gleaned from the two sequences. We discuss topics including the analysis of the evolutionary forces shaping the size, structure and sequence of the genomes; the conservation of large-scale synteny across most of the genomes; the much lower extent of sequence orthology covering less than half of the genomes; the proportions of the genomes under selection; the number of protein-coding genes; the expansion of gene families related to reproduction and immunity; the evolution of proteins; and the identification of intraspecies polymorphism."], ["Regio- and Stereoselective Ring-Opening Metathesis Polymerization of 3-Substituted Cyclooctenes", "3-Substituted cis-cyclooctenes (3RCOEs, R = methyl, ethyl, hexyl, and phenyl) were synthesized and polymerized, and the polymers therefrom were hydrogenated to prepare model linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) samples. The ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of the 3RCOEs using Grubbs' catalyst proceeded in a regio- and stereoselective manner to afford polyoctenamers [poly(3RCOE)] exhibiting remarkably high head-to-tail regioregularity and high trans-stereoregularity.

Failure to maintain appropriate levels of metal ions in humans is a feature of hereditary haemoduomatosis(1), disorders of metal-ion deficiency, and certain neurodegenerative diseases(2). Despite their pivotal physiological roles, however, there is no molecular information on how metal ions are actively absorbed by mammalian cells. We have now identified a new metal-ion transporter in the rat, DCT1, which has an unusually broad substrate range that includes Fe2+ Zn2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, and Pb2+. DCT1 mediates active transport that is proton-coupled and depends on the cell membrane potential, It is a 561-amino-acid protein with 12 putative membrane-spanning domains and is ubiquitously expressed, most notably in the proximal duodenum. DCT1 is upregulated by dietary iron deficiency, and may represent a key mediator of intestinal iron absorption. DCT1 is a member of the 'natural-resistance-associated macrophage protein' (Nramp) family(3-5) and thus its properties provide insight into how these proteins confer resistance to pathogens."], ["Blocking FSH induces thermogenic adipose tissue and reduces body fat", "Menopause is associated with bone loss and enhanced visceral adiposity. A polyclonal antibody that targets the beta-subunit of the pituitary hormone follicle-stimulating hormone (Fsh) increases bone mass in mice. Here, we report that this antibody sharply reduces adipose tissue in wild-type mice, phenocopying genetic haploinsufficiency for the Fsh receptor gene Fshr. The antibody also causes profound beiging, increases cellular mitochondrial density, activates brown adipose tissue and enhances thermogenesis. These actions result from the specific binding of the antibody to the beta-subunit of Fsh to block its action. Our studies uncover opportunities for simultaneously treating obesity and osteoporosis."], ["A mobile robotic chemist", "Technologies such as batteries, biomaterials and heterogeneous catalysts have functionsthat are defined by mixtures of molecular and mesoscale components. As yet, this multi-length-scale complexity cannot be fully captured by atomistic simulations, and the design of such materials from first principles is still rare(1-5). Likewise, experimental complexity scales exponentially with the number of variables, restricting most searches to narrow areas of materials space. Robots can assist in experimental searches(6-14)but their widespread adoption in materials research is challenging because of the diversity of sample types, operations, instruments and measurements required. Here we use a mobile robot to search for improved photocatalysts for hydrogen production from water(15). The robot operated autonomously over eight days, performing 688 experiments within a ten-variable experimental space, driven by a batched Bayesian search algorithm(16-18). This autonomous search identified photocatalyst mixturesthat were six times more active than the initial formulations, selecting beneficial components and deselecting negative ones. Our strategy uses a dexterous(19,20)free-roaming robot(21-24), automating the researcher ratherthan the instruments. This modular approach could be deployed in conventional laboratories for a range of research problems beyond photocatalysis."], ["Quantum storage of photonic entanglement in a crystal", "Entanglement is the fundamental characteristic of quantum physics-much experimental effort is devoted to harnessing it between various physical systems. In particular, entanglement between light and material systems is interesting owing to their anticipated respective roles as 'flying' and stationary qubits in quantum information technologies (such as quantum repeaters(1-3) and quantum networks(4)). Here we report the demonstration of entanglement between a photon at a telecommunication wavelength (1,338 nm) and a single collective atomic excitation stored in a crystal. One photon from an energy-time entangled pair(5) is mapped onto the crystal and then released into a well-defined spatial mode after a predetermined storage time. The other (telecommunication wavelength) photon is sent directly through a 50-metre fibre link to an analyser. Successful storage of entanglement in the crystal is proved by a violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality(6) by almost three standard deviations (S=2.64 +/- 0.23). These results represent an important step towards quantum communication technologies based on solid-state devices. In particular, our resources pave the way for building multiplexed quantum repeaters(7) for long-distance quantum networks."], ["A unifying model for mTORC1-mediated regulation of mRNA translation", "The mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase nucleates a pathway that promotes cell growth and proliferation and is the target of rapamycin, a drug with many clinical uses(1). mTORC1 regulates messenger RNA translation, but the overall translational program is poorly defined and no unifying model exists to explain how mTORC1 differentially controls the translation of specific mRNAs. Here we use high-resolution transcriptome-scale ribosome profiling to monitor translation in mouse cells acutely treated with the mTOR inhibitor Torin 1, which, unlike rapamycin, fully inhibits mTORC1 (ref. 2). Our data reveal a surprisingly simple model of the mRNA features and mechanisms that confer mTORC1-dependent translation control. The subset of mRNAs that are specifically regulated by mTORC1 consists almost entirely of transcripts with established 5' terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motifs, or, like Hsp90ab1 and Ybx1, with previously unrecognized TOP or related TOP-like motifs that we identified. We find no evidence to support proposals that mTORC1 preferentially regulates mRNAs with increased 5' untranslated region length or complexity(3). mTORC1 phosphorylates a myriad of translational regulators, but how it controls TOP mRNA translation is unknown(4). Remarkably, loss of just the 4E-BP family of translational repressors, arguably the best characterized mTORC1 substrates, is sufficient to render TOP and TOP-like mRNA translation resistant to Torin 1. The 4E-BPs inhibit translation initiation by interfering with the interaction between the cap-binding protein eIF4E and eIF4G1. Loss of this interaction diminishes the capacity of eIF4E to bind TOP and TOP-like mRNAs much more than other mRNAs, explaining why mTOR inhibition selectively suppresses their translation. Our results clarify the translational program controlled by mTORC1 and identify 4E-BPs and eIF4G1 as its master effectors."], ["Medulloblastoma exome sequencing uncovers subtype-specific somatic mutations", "Medulloblastomas are themost commonmalignant brain tumours in children(1). Identifying and understanding the genetic events that drive these tumours is critical for the development of more effective diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic strategies. Recently, our group and others described distinct molecular subtypes ofmedulloblastoma on the basis of transcriptional and copy number profiles(2-5). Here we use whole-exome hybrid capture and deep sequencing to identify somatic mutations across the coding regions of 92 primary medulloblastoma/normal pairs. Overall, medulloblastomas have low mutation rates consistent with other paediatric tumours, with a median of 0.35 non-silent mutations per megabase. We identified twelve genes mutated at statistically significant frequencies, including previously known mutated genes in medulloblastoma such as CTNNB1, PTCH1, MLL2, SMARCA4 andTP53. Recurrent somatic mutations were newly identified in an RNA helicase gene, DDX3X, often concurrent with CTNNB1 mutations, and in the nuclear co-repressor (N-CoR) complex genes GPS2, BCOR and LDB1. We show that mutant DDX3X potentiates transactivation of a TCF promoter and enhances cell viability in combination with mutant, but not wild-type, beta-catenin. Together, our study reveals the alteration ofWNT, hedgehog, histone methyltransferase and now N-CoR pathways across medulloblastomas and within specific subtypes of this disease, and nominates theRNA helicase DDX3X as a component of pathogenic b-catenin signalling in medulloblastoma."], ["Critical role of hydrogen for superconductivity in nickelates", "The newly discovered nickelate superconductors so far only exist in epitaxial thin films synthesized by a topotactic reaction with metal hydrides(1). This method changes the nickelates from the perovskite to an infinite-layer structure by deintercalation of apical oxygens(1-3). Such a chemical reaction may introduce hydrogen (H), influencing the physical properties of the end materials(4-9). Unfortunately, H is insensitive to most characterization techniques and is difficult to detect because of its light weight. Here, in optimally Sr doped Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2H epitaxial films, secondary-ion mass spectroscopy shows abundant H existing in the form of Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2Hx (x approximately equal to 0.2-0.5). Zero resistivity is found within a very narrow H-doping window of 0.22 = x = 0.28, showing unequivocally the critical role of H in superconductivity. Resonant inelastic X-ray scattering demonstrates the existence of itinerant interstitial s (IIS) orbitals originating from apical oxygen deintercalation. Density functional theory calculations show that electronegative H- occupies the apical oxygen sites annihilating IIS orbitals, reducing the IIS-Ni 3d orbital hybridization. This leads the electronic structure of H-doped Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2Hx to be more two-dimensional-like, which might be relevant for the observed superconductivity. We highlight that H is an important ingredient for superconductivity in epitaxial infinite-layer nickelates."], ["Long-range ordered porous carbons produced from C<sub>60</sub>", "Carbon structures with covalent bonds connecting C-60 molecules have been reported(1-3), but their production methods typically result in very small amounts of sample, which restrict the detailed characterization and exploration necessary for potential applications. We report the gram-scale preparation of a new type of carbon, long-range ordered porous carbon (LOPC), from C-60 powder catalysed by alpha-Li3N at ambient pressure. LOPC consists of connected broken C-60 cages that maintain long-range periodicity, and has been characterized by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, magic-angle spinning solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy and neutron scattering. Numerical simulations based on a neural network show that LOPC is a metastable structure produced during the transformation from fullerene-type to graphene-type carbons. At a lower temperature, shorter annealing time or by using less alpha-Li3N, a well-known polymerized C-60 crystal forms owing to the electron transfer from alpha-Li3N to C-60. The carbon K-edge near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure shows a higher degree of delocalization of electrons in LOPC than in C-60(s). The electrical conductivity is 1.17 x 10(-2) S cm(-1) at room temperature, and conduction at T < 30 K appears to result from a combination of metallic-like transport over short distances punctuated by carrier hopping. The preparation of LOPC enables the discovery of other crystalline carbons starting from C-60(s)."], ["Van der Waals integration before and beyond two-dimensional materials", "Material integration strategies, such as epitaxial growth, usually involve strong chemical bonds and are typically limited to materials with strict structure matching and processing compatibility. Van der Waals integration, in which pre-fabricated building blocks are physically assembled together through weak van der Waals interactions, offers an alternative bond-free integration strategy without lattice and processing limitations, as exemplified by two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures.

Furthermore, their properties and interaction with DNA and RNA could provide a better understanding of the structural features of natural DNA that determine its unique chemical, biological and genetic properties3,4. We recently designed a DNA analogue, PNA, in which the backbone is structurally homomorphous with the deoxyribose backbone and consists of N-(2-aminoethyl)glycine units to which the nucleobases are attached5-9. We showed that PNA oligomers containing solely thymine and cytosine can hybridize to complementary oligonucleotides, presumably by forming Watson-Crick-Hoogsteen (PNA)2-DNA triplexes, which are much more stable than the corresponding DNA-DNA duplexes5-7, and bind to double-stranded DNA by strand displacement5,8. We report here that PNA containing all four natural nucleobases hybridizes to complementary oligonucleotides obeying the Watson-Crick base-pairing rules, and thus is a true DNA mimic in terms of base-pair recognition."], ["Synthetic non-oxidative glycolysis enables complete carbon conservation", "Glycolysis, or its variations, is a fundamental metabolic pathway in life that functions in almost all organisms to decompose external or intracellular sugars. The pathway involves the partial oxidation and splitting of sugars to pyruvate, which in turn is decarboxylated to produce acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) for various biosynthetic purposes. The decarboxylation of pyruvate loses a carbon equivalent, and limits the theoretical carbon yield to only two moles of two-carbon (C2) metabolites per mole of hexose. This native route is a major source of carbon loss in biorefining and microbial carbon metabolism. Here we design and construct a non-oxidative, cyclic pathway that allows the production of stoichiometric amounts of C2 metabolites from hexose, pentose and triose phosphates without carbon loss. We tested this pathway, termed non-oxidative glycolysis (NOG), in vitro and in vivo in Escherichia coli. NOG enables complete carbon conservation in sugar catabolism to acetyl-CoA, and can be used in conjunction with CO2 fixation(1) and other one-carbon (C1) assimilation pathways(2) to achieve a 100% carbon yield to desirable fuels and chemicals."], ["Role of sulphuric acid, ammonia and galactic cosmic rays in atmospheric aerosol nucleation", "Atmospheric aerosols exert an important influence on climate(1) through their effects on stratiform cloud albedo and lifetime(2) and the invigoration of convective storms(3). Model calculations suggest that almost half of the global cloud condensation nuclei in the atmospheric boundary layer may originate from the nucleation of aerosols from trace condensable vapours(4), although the sensitivity of the number of cloud condensation nuclei to changes of nucleation rate may be small(5,6). Despite extensive research, fundamental questions remain about the nucleation rate of sulphuric acid particles and the mechanisms responsible, including the roles of galactic cosmic rays and other chemical species such as ammonia(7). Here we present the first results from the CLOUD experiment at CERN. We find that atmospherically relevant ammonia mixing ratios of 100 parts per trillion by volume, or less, increase the nucleation rate of sulphuric acid particles more than 100-1,000-fold. Time-resolved molecular measurements reveal that nucleation proceeds by a base-stabilization mechanism involving the stepwise accretion of ammonia molecules. Ions increase the nucleation rate by an additional factor of between two and more than ten at ground-level galactic-cosmic-ray intensities, provided that the nucleation rate lies below the limiting ion-pair production rate. We find that ion-induced binary nucleation of H2SO4-H2O can occur in the midtroposphere but is negligible in the boundary layer. However, even with the large enhancements in rate due to ammonia and ions, atmospheric concentrations of ammonia and sulphuric acid are insufficient to account for observed boundary-layer nucleation."], ["Strong tough hydrogels via the synergy of freeze-casting and salting out", "Natural load-bearing materials such as tendons have a high water content of about 70 per cent but are still strong and tough, even when used for over one million cycles per year, owing to the hierarchical assembly of anisotropic structures across multiple length scales1. Synthetic hydrogels have been created using methods such as electro-spinning2, extrusion3, compositing4,5, freeze-casting6,7, self-assembly8 and mechanical stretching9,10 for improved mechanical performance. However, in contrast to tendons, many hydrogels with the same high water content do not show high strength, toughness or fatigue resistance. Here we present a strategy to produce a multi-length-scale hierarchical hydrogel architecture using a freezing-assisted salting-out treatment. The produced poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogels are highly anisotropic, comprising micrometre-scale honeycomb-like pore walls, which in turn comprise interconnected nanofibril meshes. These hydrogels have a water content of 70\u201395 per cent and properties that compare favourably to those of other tough hydrogels and even natural tendons; for example, an ultimate stress of 23.5 \u00b1 2.7 megapascals, strain levels of 2,900 \u00b1 450 per cent, toughness of 210 \u00b1 13 megajoules per cubic metre, fracture energy of 170 \u00b1 8 kilojoules per square metre and a fatigue threshold of 10.5 \u00b1 1.3 kilojoules per square metre.

Efforts to mimic such dynamics synthetically rely on multimaterial designs but face limits to programming arbitrary motions or diverse behaviours in one structure(3-8). Here we show how diverse, complex, non-reciprocal, stroke-like trajectories emerge in a single-material system through self-regulation. When a micropost composed of photoresponsive liquid crystal elastomer with mesogens aligned oblique to the structure axis is exposed to a static light source, dynamic dances evolve as light initiates a travelling order-to-disorder transition front, transiently turning the structure into a complex evolving bimorph that twists and bends via multilevel opto-chemo-mechanical feedback. As captured by our theoretical model, the travelling front continuously reorients the molecular, geometric and illumination axes relative to each other, yielding pathways composed from series of twisting, bending, photophobic and phototropic motions. Guided by the model, here we choreograph a wide range of trajectories by tailoring parameters, including illumination angle, light intensity, molecular anisotropy, microstructure geometry, temperature and irradiation intervals and duration. We further show how this opto-chemo-mechanical self-regulation serves as a foundation for creating self-organizing deformation patterns in closely spaced microstructure arrays via light-mediated interpost communication, as well as complex motions of jointed microstructures, with broad implications for autonomous multimodal actuators in areas such as soft robotics(7,9,10), biomedical devices(11,12) and energy transduction materials(13), and for fundamental understanding of self-regulated systems(14,15)."], ["Crystal structure of photosystem II from <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> at 3.8 \u00c5 resolution", "Oxygenic photosynthesis is the principal energy converter on earth. It is driven by photosystems I and II, two large protein-cofactor complexes located in the thylakoid membrane and acting in series. In photosystem II, water is oxidized; this event provides the overall process with the necessary electrons and protons, and the atmosphere with oxygen. To date, structural information on the architecture of the complex has been provided by electron microscopy of intact, active photosystem II at 15-30 Angstrom resolution(1), and by electron crystallography on two-dimensional crystals of D1-D2-CP47 photosystem II fragments without water oxidizing activity at 8 Angstrom resolution(2). Here we describe the X-ray structure of photosystem II on the basis of crystals fully active in water oxidation(3). The structure shows how protein subunits and cofactors are spatially organized. The larger subunits are assigned and the locations and orientations of the cofactors are defined. We also provide new information on the position, size and shape of the manganese cluster, which catalyzes water oxidation."], ["Enhancing coherence in molecular spin qubits via atomic clock transitions", "Quantum computing is an emerging area within the information sciences revolving around the concept of quantum bits (qubits). A major obstacle is the extreme fragility of these qubits due to interactions with their environment that destroy their quantumness. This phenomenon, known as decoherence, is of fundamental interest(1,2). There are many competing candidates for qubits, including superconducting circuits(3), quantum optical cavities(4), ultracold atoms(5) and spin qubits(6-8), and each has its strengths and weaknesses. When dealing with spin qubits, the strongest source of decoherence is the magnetic dipolar interaction(9). To minimize it, spins are typically diluted in a diamagnetic matrix. For example, this dilution can be taken to the extreme of a single phosphorus atom in silicon(6), whereas in molecular matrices a typical ratio is one magnetic molecule per 10,000 matrix molecules(10). However, there is a fundamental contradiction between reducing decoherence by dilution and allowing quantum operations via the interaction between spin qubits. To resolve this contradiction, the design and engineering of quantum hardware can benefit from a 'bottom-up' approach whereby the electronic structure of magnetic molecules is chemically tailored to give the desired physical behaviour. Here we present a way of enhancing coherence in solid-state molecular spin qubits without resorting to extreme dilution. It is based on the design of molecular structures with crystal field ground states possessing large tunnelling gaps that give rise to optimal operating points, or atomic clock transitions, at which the quantum spin dynamics become protected against dipolar decoherence. This approach is illustrated with a holmium molecular nanomagnet in which long coherence times (up to 8.4 microseconds at 5 kelvin) are obtained at unusually high concentrations. This finding opens new avenues for quantum computing based on molecular spin qubits."], ["Solution-processed, high-performance light-emitting diodes based on quantum dots", "Solution-processed optoelectronic and electronic devices are attractive owing to the potential for low-cost fabrication of large-area devices and the compatibility with lightweight, flexible plastic substrates. Solution-processed light-emitting diodes (LEDs) using conjugated polymers or quantum dots as emitters have attracted great interest over the past two decades(1,2). However, the overall performance of solution-processed LEDs(2-5)-including their efficiency, efficiency roll-off at high current densities, turn-on voltage and lifetime under operational conditions-remains inferior to that of the best vacuum deposited organic LEDs(6-8). Here we report a solution-processed, multilayer quantum-dot-based LED with excellent performance and reproducibility. It exhibits colour-saturated deep-redemission, subband gap turn-on at 1.7 volts, high external quantum efficiencies of up to 20.5 per cent, low efficiency roll-off (up to 15.1 per cent of the external quantum efficiency at 100 mA cm(-2)), anda long operational lifetime of more than 100,000 hours at 100 cd m(-2), making this device the best-performing solution-processed red LED so far, comparable to state-of-the-art vacuum-deposited organic LEDs(2-8). This optoelectronic performance is achieved by inserting an insulating layer between the quantum dot layer and the oxide electron-transport layer to optimize charge balance in the device and preserve the superior emissive properties of the quantum dots. We anticipate that our results will be a starting point for further research, leading to high-performance, all-solution-processed quantum-dot-based LEDs ideal for next-generation display and solid-state lighting technologies."], ["Photocatalytic solar hydrogen production from water on a 100-m<SUP>2</SUP> scale", "The unprecedented impact of human activity on Earth's climate and the ongoing increase in global energy demand have made the development of carbon-neutral energy sources ever more important. Hydrogen is an attractive and versatile energy carrier (and important and widely used chemical) obtainable from water through photocatalysis using sunlight, and through electrolysis driven by solar or wind energy(1,2). The most efficient solar hydrogen production schemes, which couple solar cells to electrolysis systems, reach solar-to-hydrogen (STH) energy conversion efficiencies of 30% at a laboratory scale(3). Photocatalytic water splitting reaches notably lower conversion efficiencies of only around 1%, but the system design is much simpler and cheaper and more amenable to scale-up(1,2)-provided the moist, stoichiometric hydrogen and oxygen product mixture can be handled safely in a field environment and the hydrogen recovered. Extending our earlier demonstration of a 1-m(2) panel reactor system based on a modified, aluminium-doped strontium titanate particulate photocatalyst(4), we here report safe operation of a 100-m(2) array of panel reactors over several months with autonomous recovery of hydrogen from the moist gas product mixture using a commercial polyimide membrane(5). The system, optimized for safety and durability, and remaining undamaged on intentional ignition of recovered hydrogen, reaches a maximum STH of 0.76%. While the hydrogen production is inefficient and energy negative overall, our findings demonstrate that safe, large-scale photocatalytic water splitting, and gas collection and separation are possible. To make the technology economically viable and practically useful, essential next steps are reactor and process optimization to substantially reduce costs and improve STH efficiency, photocatalyst stability and gas separation efficiency."], ["Reaching for high-hanging fruit in drug discovery at protein-protein interfaces", "Targeting the interfaces between proteins has huge therapeutic potential, but discovering small- molecule drugs that disrupt protein - protein interactions is an enormous challenge. Several recent success stories, however, indicate that protein - protein interfaces might be more tractable than has been thought. These studies discovered small molecules that bind with drug- like potencies to 'hotspots' on the contact surfaces involved in protein - protein interactions. Remarkably, these small molecules bind deeper within the contact surface of the target protein, and bind with much higher efficiencies, than do the contact atoms of the natural protein partner. Some of these small molecules are now making their way through clinical trials, so this high-hanging fruit might not be far out of reach."], ["Climate change decreases aquatic ecosystem productivity of Lake Tanganyika, Africa", "Although the effects of climate warming on the chemical and physical properties of lakes have been documented(1), biotic and ecosystem-scale responses to climate change have been only estimated or predicted by manipulations and models(1). Here we present evidence that climate warming is diminishing productivity in Lake Tanganyika, East Africa. This lake has historically supported a highly productive pelagic fishery that currently provides 25-40% of the animal protein supply for the populations of the surrounding countries(2). In parallel with regional warming patterns since the beginning of the twentieth century, a rise in surface-water temperature has increased the stability of the water column. A regional decrease in wind velocity has contributed to reduced mixing, decreasing deep-water nutrient upwelling and entrainment into surface waters. Carbon isotope records in sediment cores suggest that primary productivity may have decreased by about 20%, implying a roughly 30% decrease in fish yields. Our study provides evidence that the impact of regional effects of global climate change on aquatic ecosystem functions and services can be larger than that of local anthropogenic activity or overfishing."], ["Continuous Mott transition in semiconductor moire superlattices", "The evolution of a Landau Fermi liquid into a non-magnetic Mott insulator with increasing electronic interactions is one of the most puzzling quantum phase transitions in physics(1-6). The vicinity of the transition is believed to host exotic states of matter such as quantum spin liquids(4-7), exciton condensates(8) and unconventional superconductivity(1). Semiconductor moire materials realize a highly controllable Hubbard model simulator on a triangular lattice(9-22), providing a unique opportunity to drive a metal-insulator transition (MIT) via continuous tuning of the electronic interactions. Here, by electrically tuning the effective interaction strength in MoTe2/WSe2 moire superlattices, we observe a continuous MIT at a fixed filling of one electron per unit cell. The existence of quantum criticality is supported by the scaling collapse of the resistance, a continuously vanishing charge gap as the critical point is approached from the insulating side, and a diverging quasiparticle effective mass from the metallic side. We also observe a smooth evolution of the magnetic susceptibility across the MIT and no evidence of long-range magnetic order down to similar to 5% of the Curie-Weiss temperature. This signals an abundance of low-energy spinful excitations on the insulating side that is further corroborated by the Pomeranchuk effect observed on the metallic side. Our results are consistent with the universal critical theory of a continuous Mott transition in two dimensions(4,23). The interaction strength in moire superlattices is tuned to drive a continuous metal-to-insulator transition at a fixed electron density."], ["Untangling aerosol effects on clouds and precipitation in a buffered system", "It is thought that changes in the concentration of cloud-active aerosol can alter the precipitation efficiency of clouds, thereby changing cloud amount and, hence, the radiative forcing of the climate system. Despite decades of research, it has proved frustratingly difficult to establish climatically meaningful relationships among the aerosol, clouds and precipitation. As a result, the climatic effect of the aerosol remains controversial. We propose that the difficulty in untangling relationships among the aerosol, clouds and precipitation reflects the inadequacy of existing tools and methodologies and a failure to account for processes that buffer cloud and precipitation responses to aerosol perturbations."], ["Room-temperature electrical control of exciton flux in a van der Waals heterostructure", "Devices that rely on the manipulation of excitons-bound pairs of electrons and holes-hold great promise for realizing efficient interconnects between optical data transmission and electrical processing systems. Although exciton-based transistor actions have been demonstrated successfully in bulk semiconductor-based coupled quantum wells(1-3), the low temperature required for their operation limits their practical application. The recent emergence of two-dimensional semiconductors with large exciton binding energies(4,5) may lead to excitonic devices and circuits that operate at room temperature. Whereas individual two-dimensional materials have short exciton diffusion lengths, the spatial separation of electrons and holes in different layers in heterostructures could help to overcome this limitation and enable room-temperature operation of mesoscale devices(6-8). Here we report excitonic devices made of MoS2-WSe2 van der Waals heterostructures encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride that demonstrate electrically controlled transistor actions at room temperature. The long-lived nature of the interlayer excitons in our device results in them diffusing over a distance of five micrometres. Within our device, we further demonstrate the ability to manipulate exciton dynamics by creating electrically reconfigurable confining and repulsive potentials for the exciton flux. Our results make a strong case for integrating two-dimensional materials in future excitonic devices to enable operation at room temperature."], ["Light-driven anaerobic microbial oxidation of manganese", "Oxygenic photosynthesis supplies organic carbon to the modern biosphere, but it is uncertain when this metabolism originated. It has previously been proposed(1,2) that photosynthetic reaction centres capable of splitting water arose by about 3 billion years ago on the basis of the inferred presence of manganese oxides in Archaean sedimentary rocks. However, this assumes that manganese oxides can be produced only in the presence of molecular oxygen(3), reactive oxygen species(4,5) or by high-potential photosynthetic reaction centres(6,7). Here we show that communities of anoxygenic photosynthetic microorganisms biomineralize manganese oxides in the absence of molecular oxygen and high-potential photosynthetic reaction centres. Microbial oxidation of Mn(II) under strictly anaerobic conditions during the Archaean eon would have produced geochemical signals identical to those used to date the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis before the Great Oxidation Event(1,2). This light-dependent process may also produce manganese oxides in the photic zones of modern anoxic water bodies and sediments."], ["Enhanced reversibility and unusual microstructure of a phase-transforming material", "Materials undergoing reversible solid-to-solid martensitic phase transformations are desirable for applications in medical sensors and actuators(1), eco-friendly refrigerators(2,3) and energy conversion devices(4). The ability to pass back and forth through the phase transformation many times without degradation of properties (termed 'reversibility') is critical for these applications. Materials tuned to satisfy a certain geometric compatibility condition have been shown(2,5-14) to exhibit high reversibility, measured by low hysteresis and small migration of transformation temperature under cycling(6,9,12,15). Recently, stronger compatibility conditions called the 'cofactor conditions'(5,15) have been proposed theoretically to achieve even better reversibility. Here we report the enhanced reversibility and unusual microstructure of the first martensitic material, Zn45Au30Cu25, that closely satisfies the cofactor conditions. We observe four striking properties of thismaterial. (1) Despite a transformation strain of 8%, the transformation temperature shifts less than 0.5 degrees C after more than 16,000 thermal cycles. For comparison, the transformation temperature of the ubiquitous NiTi alloy shifts up to 20 degrees C in the first 20 cycles(9,16). (2) The hysteresis remains approximately 2 degrees C during this cycling. For comparison, the hysteresis of the NiTi alloy is up to 70 degrees C (refs 9, 12). (3) The alloy exhibits an unusual riverine microstructure of martensite not seen in other martensites. (4) Unlike that of typical polycrystal martensites, its microstructure changes drastically in consecutive transformation cycles, whereas macroscopic properties such as transformation temperature and latent heat are nearly reproducible. These results promise a concrete strategy for seeking ultra-reliable martensitic materials."], ["X-ray structure of a voltage-dependent K<SUP>+</SUP> channel", "Voltage-dependent K+ channels are members of the family of voltage-dependent cation (K+, Na+ and Ca2+) channels that open and allow ion conduction in response to changes in cell membrane voltage. This form of gating underlies the generation of nerve and muscle action potentials, among other processes. Here we present the structure of KvAP, a voltage-dependent K+ channel from Aeropyrum pernix. We have determined a crystal structure of the full-length channel at a resolution of 3.2 Angstrom, and of the isolated voltage-sensor domain at 1.9 Angstrom, both in complex with monoclonal Fab fragments. The channel contains a central ion-conduction pore surrounded by voltage sensors, which form what we call 'voltage-sensor paddles'-hydrophobic, cationic, helix-turn-helix structures on the channel's outer perimeter. Flexible hinges suggest that the voltage-sensor paddles move in response to membrane voltage changes, carrying their positive charge across the membrane."], ["Structural insights into the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors", "Metabotropic glutamate receptors are family C G-protein-coupled receptors. They form obligate dimers and possess extracellular ligand-binding Venus flytrap domains, which are linked by cysteine-rich domains to their 7-transmembrane domains. Spectroscopic studies show that signalling is a dynamic process, in which large-scale conformational changes underlie the transmission of signals from the extracellular Venus flytraps to the G protein-coupling domains-the 7-transmembrane domains-in the membrane. Here, using a combination of X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy and signalling studies, we present a structural framework for the activation mechanism of metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5. Our results show that agonist binding at the Venus flytraps leads to a compaction of the intersubunit dimer interface, thereby bringing the cysteine-rich domains into close proximity. Interactions between the cysteine-rich domains and the second extracellular loops of the receptor enable the rigid-body repositioning of the 7-transmembrane domains, which come into contact with each other to initiate signalling."], ["Insights into layered oxide cathodes for rechargeable batteries", "Layered intercalation compounds are the dominant cathode materials for rechargeable Li-ion batteries. In this article we summarize in a pedagogical way our work in understanding how the structure\u2019s topology, electronic structure, and chemistry interact to determine its electrochemical performance. We discuss how alkali\u2013alkali interactions within the Li layer influence the voltage profile, the role of the transition metal electronic structure in dictating O3-structural stability, and the mechanism for alkali diffusion. We then briefly delve into emerging, next-generation Li-ion cathodes that move beyond layered intercalation hosts by discussing disordered rocksalt Li-excess structures, a class of materials which may be essential in circumventing impending resource limitations in our era of clean energy technology."], ["Local fitness landscape of the green fluorescent protein", "Fitness landscapes(1,2) depict how genotypes manifest at the phenotypic level and form the basis of our understanding of many areas of biology(2-7), yet their properties remain elusive. Previous studies have analysed specific genes, often using their function as a proxy for fitness(2,4), experimentally assessing the effect on function of single mutations and their combinations in a specific sequence(2,5,8-15) or in different sequences(2,3,5,16-18). However, systematic high-throughput studies of the local fitness landscape of an entire protein have not yet been reported. Here we visualize an extensive region of the local fitness landscape of the green fluorescent protein from Aequorea victoria (avGFP) by measuring the native function (fluorescence) of tens of thousands of derivative genotypes of avGFP. We show that the fitness landscape of avGFP is narrow, with 3/4 of the derivatives with a single mutation showing reduced fluorescence and half of the derivatives with four mutations being completely non-fluorescent. The narrowness is enhanced by epistasis, which was detected in up to 30% of genotypes with multiple mutations and mostly occurred through the cumulative effect of slightly deleterious mutations causing a threshold-like decrease in protein stability and a concomitant loss of fluorescence. A model of orthologous sequence divergence spanning hundreds of millions of years predicted the extent of epistasis in our data, indicating congruence between the fitness landscape properties at the local and global scales. The characterization of the local fitness landscape of avGFP has important implications for several fields including molecular evolution, population genetics and protein design."], ["Small-bandgap endohedral metallofullerenes in high yield and purity", "The idea(1) that fullerenes might be able to encapsulate atoms and molecules has been verified by the successful synthesis of a range of endohedral fullerenes, in which metallic or nan-metallic species are trapped inside the carbon cage(2-13). Metal-containing endohedral fullerenes have attracted particular interest as they might exhibit unusual material properties associated with charge transfer from the metal to the carbon shell. However, current synthesis methods have typical yields of less than 0.5%, and produce multiple endohedral fullerene isomers, which makes it difficult to perform detailed studies of their properties. Here we show that the introduction of small amounts of nitrogen into an electric-are reactor allows for the efficient production of a new family of stable endohedral fullerenes encapsulating trimetallic nitride clusters, ErxSc3-xN@C-80 (x = 0-3). This 'trimetallic nitride template' process generates milligram quantities of product containing 3-5% Sc3N@C-80, which allows us to isolate the material and determine its crystal structure, and its optical and electronic properties. We find that the Sc3N moiety is encapsulated in a highly symmetric, icosahedral C-80 cage, which is stabilized as a result of charge transfer between the nitride cluster and the fullerene cage. We expect that our method will provide access to a range of small-bandgap fullerene materials, whose electronic properties can be tuned by encapsulating nitride clusters containing different metals and metal mixtures."], ["Tautomeric mixture coordination enables efficient lead-free perovskite LEDs", "Lead halide perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have demonstrated remarkable optoelectronic performance1-3. However, there are potential toxicity issues with lead4,5 and removing lead from the best-performing PeLEDs-without compromising their high external quantum efficiencies-remains a challenge. Here we report a tautomeric-mixture-coordination-induced electron localization strategy to stabilize the lead-free tin perovskite TEA2SnI4 (TEAI is 2-thiopheneethylammonium iodide) by incorporating cyanuric acid. We demonstrate that a crucial function of the coordination is to amplify the electronic effects, even for those Sn atoms that aren't strongly bonded with cyanuric acid owing to the formation of hydrogen-bonded tautomeric dimer and trimer superstructures on the perovskite surface. This electron localization weakens adverse effects from Anderson localization and improves ordering in the crystal structure of TEA2SnI4. These factors result in a two-orders-of-magnitude reduction in the non-radiative recombination capture coefficient and an approximately twofold enhancement in the exciton binding energy. Our lead-free PeLED has an external quantum efficiency of up to 20.29%, representing a performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art lead-containing PeLEDs6-12. We anticipate that these findings will provide insights into the stabilization of Sn(II) perovskites and further the development of lead-free perovskite applications. Lead-free perovskite light-emitting diodes (LEDs) prepared using tautomeric mixture coordination provide improved ordering in the crystal structure, reduced recombination and enhanced exciton binding energy compared with lead-containing perovskite-based LEDs."], ["Molecular characterization of an enzyme that degrades neuromodulatory fatty-acid amides", "ENDOGENOUS neuromodulatory molecules are commonly coupled to specific metabolic enzymes to ensure rapid signal inactivation, Thus, acetylcholine is hydrolysed by acetylcholine esterase(1) and tryptamine neurotransmitters like serotonin are degraded by monoamine oxidases(2). Previously, we reported the structure and sleep-inducing properties of cis-9-octadecenamide, a lipid isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of sleep-deprived cats(3). cis-9-Octadecenamide, or oleamide, has since been shown to affect serotonergic systems(4) and block gap-junction communication in glial cells (our unpublished results). We also identified a membrane-bound enzyme activity that hydrolyses oleamide to its inactive acid, oleic acid(3). We now report the mechanism-based isolation, cloning and expression of this enzyme activity, originally named oleamide hydrolase(5), from rat liver plasma membranes. We also show that oleamide hydrolase converts anandamide, a fatty-acid amide identified as the endogenous ligand for the cannabinoid receptor(6), to arachidonic acid, indicating that oleamide hydrolase may serve as the general inactivating enzyme for a growing family of bioactive signalling molecules, the fatty-acid amides(6-8). Therefore we will hereafter refer to oleamide hydrolase as fatty-acid amide hydrolase, in recognition of the plurality of fatty-acid amides that the enzyme can accept as substrates."], ["Biologically inspired oxidation catalysis", "The development of processes for selective hydrocarbon oxidation is a goal that has long been pursued. An additional challenge is to make such processes environmentally friendly, for example by using nontoxic reagents and energy- efficient catalytic methods. Excellent examples are naturally occurring iron- or copper- containing metalloenzymes, and extensive studies have revealed the key chemical principles that underlie their efficacy as catalysts for aerobic oxidations. Important inroads have been made in applying this knowledge to the development of synthetic catalysts that model enzyme function. Such biologically inspired hydrocarbon oxidation catalysts hold great promise for wide- ranging synthetic applications."], ["Synthesis, characterization, and recycling of bio-derivable polyester covalently adaptable networks for industrial composite applications", "Fiber-reinforced polymers (FRPs) are critical for energy-relevant applications such as wind turbine blades. Despite this, the end-of-life options for FRPs are limited as they are permanently cross-linked thermosets. To enable the circularity of FRPs, we formulated a bio-derivable polyester covalently adaptable network (PECAN), sometimes referred to as a polyester vitrimer, to manufacture FRPs at >1 kg scale, which is accomplished as the resin is infusible (175\u2013425 cP at 25\u00b0C viscosity), can be cured at 80\u00b0C within 5 h and is depolymerizable via methanolysis yielding high-quality fibers and recoverable hardener. The FRPs exhibit a transverse tensile modulus comparable with today\u2019s wind relevant FRPs (10.4\u201311.9 GPa). Modeling estimates a resin minimum selling price of $2.28/kg and, relative to an epoxy-amine resin, PECAN manufacture requires 19%\u201321% less supply chain energy and emits 33%\u201335% less greenhouse gas emissions. Overall, this study suggests that redesigned thermosets can yield beneficial circularity."], ["Conformational biosensors reveal GPCR signalling from endosomes", "A long-held tenet of molecular pharmacology is that canonical signal transduction mediated by G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins is confined to the plasma membrane. Evidence supporting this traditional view is based on analytical methods that provide limited or no subcellular resolution(1). It has been subsequently proposed that signalling by internalized GPCRs is restricted to G-protein-independent mechanisms such as scaffolding by arrestins(2,3), or GPCR activation elicits a discrete formof persistent G protein signalling(4-9), or that internalized GPCRs can indeed contribute to the acute G-protein-mediated response(10). Evidence supporting these various latter hypotheses is indirect or subject to alternative interpretation, and it remains unknown if endosome-localized GPCRs are even present in an active form. Here we describe the application of conformation-specific single-domain antibodies (nanobodies) to directly probe activation of the beta(2)-adrenoceptor, a prototypical GPCR(11), and its cognate G protein, G(s) (ref. 12), in living mammalian cells. We show that the adrenergic agonist isoprenaline promotes receptor and G protein activation in the plasma membrane as expected, but also in the early endosome membrane, and that internalized receptors contribute to the overall cellular cyclic AMP response within several minutes after agonist application. These findings provide direct support for the hypothesis that canonical GPCR signalling occurs from endosomes as well as the plasma membrane, and suggest a versatile strategy for probing dynamic conformational change in vivo."], ["Automated design of ligands to polypharmacological profiles", "The clinical efficacy and safety of a drug is determined by its activity profile across many proteins in the proteome. However, designing drugs with a specific multi-target profile is both complex and difficult. Therefore methods to design drugs rationally a priori against profiles of several proteins would have immense value in drug discovery. Here we describe a new approach for the automated design of ligands against profiles of multiple drug targets. The method is demonstrated by the evolution of an approved acetylcholinesterase inhibitor drug into brain-penetrable ligands with either specific polypharmacology or exquisite selectivity profiles for G-protein-coupled receptors. Overall, 800 ligand-target predictions of prospectively designed ligands were tested experimentally, of which 75% were confirmed to be correct. We also demonstrate target engagement in vivo. The approach can be a useful source of drug leads when multi-target profiles are required to achieve either selectivity over other drug targets or a desired polypharmacology."], ["Central role of detachment faults in accretion of slow-spreading oceanic lithosphere", "The formation of oceanic detachment faults is well established from inactive, corrugated fault planes exposed on sea floor formed along ridges spreading at less than 80 km Myr(-1) ( refs 1 - 4). These faults can accommodate extension for up to 1 - 3 Myr ( ref. 5), and are associated with one of the two contrasting modes of accretion operating along the northern Mid- Atlantic Ridge. The first mode is asymmetrical accretion involving an active detachment fault(6) along one ridge flank. The second mode is the well- known symmetrical accretion, dominated by magmatic processes with subsidiary high- angle faulting and the formation of abyssal hills on both flanks. Here we present an examination of similar to 2,500 km of the Mid- Atlantic Ridge between 12.5 and 35 degrees N, which reveals asymmetrical accretion along almost half of the ridge. Hydrothermal activity identified so far in the study region is closely associated with asymmetrical accretion, which also shows high levels of near-continuous hydroacoustically and teleseismically recorded seismicity. Increased seismicity is probably generated along detachment faults that accommodate a sizeable proportion of the total plate separation. In contrast, symmetrical segments have lower levels of seismicity, which occurs primarily at segment ends. Basalts erupted along asymmetrical segments have compositions that are consistent with crystallization at higher pressures than basalts from symmetrical segments, and with lower extents of partial melting of the mantle. Both seismic evidence and geochemical evidence indicate that the axial lithosphere is thicker and colder at asymmetrical sections of the ridge, either because associated hydrothermal circulation efficiently penetrates to greater depths or because the rising mantle is cooler. We suggest that much of the variability in sea- floor morphology, seismicity and basalt chemistry found along slow- spreading ridges can be thus attributed to the frequent involvement of detachment faults in oceanic lithospheric accretion."], ["The mitochondrial deubiquitinase USP30 opposes parkin-mediated mitophagy", "Cells maintain healthy mitochondria by degrading damaged mitochondria through mitophagy; defective mitophagy is linked to Parkinson's disease. Here we report that USP30, a deubiquitinase localized to mitochondria, antagonizes mitophagy driven by the ubiquitin ligase parkin (also known as PARK2) and protein kinase PINK1, which are encoded by two genes associated with Parkinson's disease. Parkin ubiquitinates and tags damaged mitochondria for clearance. Overexpression of USP 30 removes ubiquitin attached by parkin onto damaged mitochondria and blocks parkin's ability to drive mitophagy, whereas reducing USP30 activity enhances mitochondrial degradation in neurons. Global ubiquitination site profiling identified multiple mitochondrial substrates oppositely regulated by parkin and USP30. Knockdown of USP30 rescues the defective mitophagy caused by pathogenic mutations in parkin and improves mitochondrial integrity in parkin-or PINK1-deficient flies. Knockdown of USP30 in dopaminergic neurons protects flies against paraquat toxicity in vivo, ameliorating defects in dopamine levels, motor function and organismal survival. Thus USP30 inhibition is potentially beneficial for Parkinson's disease by promoting mitochondrial clearance and quality control."], ["Enhanced proofreading governs CRISPR-Cas9 targeting accuracy", "The RNA-guided CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9) has been widely repurposed for genome editing1-4. High-fidelity (SpCas9-HF1) and enhanced specificity (eSpCas9(1.1)) variants exhibit substantially reduced off-target cleavage in human cells, but the mechanism of target discrimination and the potential to further improve fidelity are unknown5-9. Here, using single-molecule Frster resonance energy transfer experiments, we show that both SpCas9-HF1 and eSpCas9(1.1) are trapped in an inactive state10 when bound to mismatched targets. We find that a non-catalytic domain within Cas9, REC3, recognizes target complementarity and governs the HNH nuclease to regulate overall catalytic competence. Exploiting this observation, we design a new hyper-accurate Cas9 variant (HypaCas9) that demonstrates high genome-wide specificity without compromising on-target activity in human cells. These results offer a more comprehensive model to rationalize and modify the balance between target recognition and nuclease activation for precision genome editing."], ["Virus genomes reveal factors that spread and sustained the Ebola epidemic", "The 2013-2016 West African epidemic caused by the Ebola virus was of unprecedented magnitude, duration and impact. Here we reconstruct the dispersal, proliferation and decline of Ebola virus throughout the region by analysing 1,610 Ebola virus genomes, which represent over 5% of the known cases. We test the association of geography, climate and demography with viral movement among administrative regions, inferring a classic 'gravity' model, with intense dispersal between larger and closer populations. Despite attenuation of international dispersal after border closures, cross-border transmission had already sown the seeds for an international epidemic, rendering these measures ineffective at curbing the epidemic. We address why the epidemic did not spread into neighbouring countries, showing that these countries were susceptible to substantial outbreaks but at lower risk of introductions. Finally, we reveal that this large epidemic was a heterogeneous and spatially dissociated collection of transmission clusters of varying size, duration and connectivity. These insights will help to inform interventions in future epidemics."], ["Design of protein-binding proteins from the target structure alone", "The design of proteinsthat bind to a specific site on the surface of a target protein using no information other than the three-dimensional structure of the target remains a challenge' 5 . Here we describe a general solution to this problem that starts with a broad exploration of the vast space of possible binding modes to a selected region of a protein surface, and then intensifiesthe search in the vicinity of the most promising binding modes. We demonstrate the broad applicability of this approach through the de novo design of binding proteins to 12 diverse protein targets with different shapes and surface properties. Biophysical characterization showsthat the binders, which are all smaller than 65 amino acids, are hyperstable and, following experimental optimization, bind their targets with nanomolar to picomolar affinities. We succeeded in solving crystal structures of five of the binder-target complexes, and all five closely match the corresponding computational design models. Experimental data on nearly half a million computational designs and hundreds of thousands of point mutants provide detailed feedback on the strengths and limitations of the method and of our current understanding of protein-protein interactions, and should guide improvements of both. Our approach enables the targeted design of bindersto sites of interest on a wide variety of proteins for therapeutic and diagnostic applications."], ["Fractional Chern insulators in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene", "Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) are lattice analogues of fractional quantum Hall states that may provide a new avenue towards manipulating non-Abelian excitations. Early theoretical studies(1-7) have predicted their existence in systems with flat Chern bands and highlighted the critical role of a particular quantum geometry. However, FCI states have been observed only in Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG) aligned with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)(8), in which a very large magnetic field is responsible for the existence of the Chern bands, precluding the realization of FCIs at zero field. By contrast, magic-angle twisted BLG(9-12) supports flat Chern bands at zero magnetic field(13-17), and therefore offers a promising route towards stabilizing zero-field FCIs. Here we report the observation of eight FCI states at low magnetic field in magic-angle twisted BLG enabled by high-resolution local compressibility measurements. The first of these states emerge at 5 T, and their appearance is accompanied by the simultaneous disappearance of nearby topologically trivial charge density wave states. We demonstrate that, unlike the case of the BLG/hBN platform, the principal role of the weak magnetic field is merely to redistribute the Berry curvature of the native Chern bands and thereby realize a quantum geometry favourable for the emergence of FCIs. Our findings strongly suggest that FCIs may be realized at zero magnetic field and pave the way for the exploration and manipulation of anyonic excitations in flat moire Chern bands."], ["Battery materials for ultrafast charging and discharging", "The storage of electrical energy at high charge and discharge rate is an important technology in today's society, and can enable hybrid and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and provide back-up for wind and solar energy. It is typically believed that in electrochemical systems very high power rates can only be achieved with supercapacitors, which trade high power for low energy density as they only store energy by surface adsorption reactions of charged species on an electrode material(1-3). Here we show that batteries(4,5) which obtain high energy density by storing charge in the bulk of a material can also achieve ultrahigh discharge rates, comparable to those of supercapacitors. We realize this in LiFePO4 (ref. 6), a material with high lithium bulk mobility(7,8), by creating a fast ion-conducting surface phase through controlled off-stoichiometry. A rate capability equivalent to full battery discharge in 10-20 s can be achieved."], ["A mildly relativistic wide-angle outflow in the neutron-star merger event GW170817", "GW170817 was the first gravitational-wave detection of a binary neutron-star merger(1). It was accompanied by radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum and localized(2) to the galaxy NGC 4993 at a distance of 40 megaparsecs. It has been proposed that the observed gamma-ray, X-ray and radio emission is due to an ultra-relativistic jet being launched during the merger (and successfully breaking out of the surrounding material), directed away from our line of sight (off-axis)(3-6). The presence of such a jet is predicted from models that posit neutron-star mergers as the drivers of short hard-gamma-ray bursts(7,8). Here we report that the radio light curve of GW170817 has no direct signature of the afterglow of an off-axis jet. Although we cannot completely rule out the existence of a jet directed away from the line of sight, the observed gamma-ray emission could not have originated from such a jet. Instead, the radio data require the existence of a mildly relativistic wide-angle outflow moving towards us. This outflow could be the high-velocity tail of the neutron-rich material that was ejected dynamically during the merger, or a cocoon of material that breaks out when a jet launched during the merger transfers its energy to the dynamical ejecta. Because the cocoon model explains the radio light curve of GW170817, as well as the gamma-ray and X-ray emission (and possibly also the ultraviolet and optical emission)(9-15), it is the model that is most consistent with the observational data. Cocoons may be a ubiquitous phenomenon produced in neutron-star mergers, giving rise to a hitherto unidentified population of radio, ultraviolet, X-ray and gamma-ray transients in the local Universe."], ["Effect of solvation shell structure on thermopower of liquid redox pairs", "Recent advancements in thermogalvanic batteries offer a promising route to efficient harvesting of low-grade heat with temperatures below 100 \u00b0C. The thermogalvanic temperature coefficient {\u0007lpha}, usually referred to as effective thermopower, is the key parameter determining the power density and efficiency of thermogalvanic batteries. However, the current understanding of improving {\u0007lpha} of redox pairs remains at the phenomenological level without microscopic insights, and the development of electrolytes with high {\u0007lpha} largely relies on experimental trial and error. This work applies the free energy perturbation method based on molecular dynamics simulations to predict the {\u0007lpha} of the {Fe^{3+}/Fe^{2+}} redox pair in aqueous and acetone solutions. We showed that {\u0007lpha} of the {Fe^{3+}/Fe^{2+}} redox pair can be increased from 1.5{\\pm}0.3 mV/K to 4.1{\\pm}0.4 mV/K with the increased acetone to water fraction. The predicted {\u0007lpha} of {Fe^{3+}/Fe^{2+}} both in pure water and acetone show excellent agreement with experimental values. By monitoring the fluctuation of dipole orientations in the first solvation shell, we discovered a significant change in the variance of solvent dipole orientation between Fe^{3+} and Fe^{2+}, which can be a microscopic indicator for large magnitudes of {\u0007lpha}. The effect of acetone weight fraction in the mixed acetone-water solvent on the {\u0007lpha} of {Fe^{3+}/Fe^{2+}} is also studied. Acetone molecules are found to intercalate into the first solvation shell of the {Fe^{2+}} ion at high acetone fractions, while this phenomenon is not observed in the solvation shell of the Fe^{3+} ion. Such solvation shell structure change of {Fe^{2+}} ions contributes to the enhanced {\u0007lpha} at high acetone fractions. Our discovery provides atomistic insights into how solvation shell order can be leveraged to develop electrolytes with high thermopower."], ["Active superelasticity in three-dimensional epithelia of controlled shape", "Fundamental biological processes are carried out by curved epithelial sheets that enclose a pressurized lumen. How these sheets develop and withstand three-dimensional deformations has remained unclear. Here we combine measurements of epithelial tension and shape with theoretical modelling to show that epithelial sheets are active superelastic materials. We produce arrays of epithelial domes with controlled geometry. Quantification of luminal pressure and epithelial tension reveals a tensional plateau over several-fold areal strains. These extreme strains in the tissue are accommodated by highly heterogeneous strains at a cellular level, in seeming contradiction to the measured tensional uniformity. This phenomenon is reminiscent of superelasticity, a behaviour that is generally attributed to microscopic material instabilities in metal alloys. We show that in epithelial cells this instability is triggered by a stretch-induced dilution of the actin cortex, and is rescued by the intermediate filament network. Our study reveals a type of mechanical behaviour-which we term active superelasticity -that enables epithelial sheets to sustain extreme stretching under constant tension."], ["The Norway spruce genome sequence and conifer genome evolution", "Conifers have dominated forests for more than 200 million years and are of huge ecological and economic importance. Here we present the draft assembly of the 20-gigabase genome of Norway spruce (Picea abies), the first available for any gymnosperm. The number of well-supported genes (28,354) is similar to the >100 times smaller genome of Arabidopsis thaliana, and there is no evidence of a recent whole-genome duplication in the gymnosperm lineage. Instead, the large genome size seems to result from the slow and steady accumulation of a diverse set of long-terminal repeat transposable elements, possibly owing to the lack of an efficient elimination mechanism. Comparative sequencing of Pinus sylvestris, Abies sibirica, Juniperus communis, Taxus baccata and Gnetum gnemon reveals that the transposable element diversity is shared among extant conifers. Expression of 24-nucleotide small RNAs, previously implicated in transposable element silencing, is tissue-specific and much lower than in other plants. We further identify numerous long (>10,000 base pairs) introns, gene-like fragments, uncharacterized long non-coding RNAs and short RNAs. This opens up new genomic avenues for conifer forestry and breeding."], ["Correlated insulator behaviour at half-filling in magic-angle graphene superlattices", "A van der Waals heterostructure is a type of metamaterial that consists of vertically stacked two-dimensional building blocks held together by the van der Waals forces between the layers. This design means that the properties of van der Waals heterostructures can be engineered precisely, even more so than those of two-dimensional materials(1). One such property is the 'twist' angle between different layers in the heterostructure. This angle has a crucial role in the electronic properties of van der Waals heterostructures, but does not have a direct analogue in other types of heterostructure, such as semiconductors grown using molecular beam epitaxy. For small twist angles, the moire pattern that is produced by the lattice misorientation between the two-dimensional layers creates long-range modulation of the stacking order. So far, studies of the effects of the twist angle in van der Waals heterostructures have concentrated mostly on heterostructures consisting of monolayer graphene on top of hexagonal boron nitride, which exhibit relatively weak interlayer interaction owing to the large bandgap in hexagonal boron nitride(2-5). Here we study a heterostructure consisting of bilayer graphene, in which the two graphene layers are twisted relative to each other by a certain angle. We show experimentally that, as predicted theoretically(6), when this angle is close to the 'magic' angle the electronic band structure near zero Fermi energy becomes flat, owing to strong interlayer coupling. These flat bands exhibit insulating states at half-filling, which are not expected in the absence of correlations between electrons. We show that these correlated states at half-filling are consistent with Mott-like insulator states, which can arise from electrons being localized in the superlattice that is induced by the moire pattern. These properties of magic-angle-twisted bilayer graphene heterostructures suggest that these materials could be used to study other exotic many-body quantum phases in two dimensions in the absence of a magnetic field. The accessibility of the flat bands through electrical tunability and the bandwidth tunability through the twist angle could pave the way towards more exotic correlated systems, such as unconventional superconductors and quantum spin liquids."], ["The Chaotropic Effect as an Assembly Motif in Chemistry", "Following up on scattered reports on interactions of conventional chaotropic ions (for example, I\u2212, SCN\u2212, ClO4\u2212) with macrocyclic host molecules, biomolecules, and hydrophobic neutral surfaces in aqueous solution, the chaotropic effect has recently emerged as a generic driving force for supramolecular assembly, orthogonal to the hydrophobic effect. The chaotropic effect becomes most effective for very large ions that extend beyond the classical Hofmeister scale and that can be referred to as superchaotropic ions (for example, borate clusters and polyoxometalates). In this Minireview, we present a continuous scale of water\u2013solute interactions that includes the solvation of kosmotropic, chaotropic, and hydrophobic solutes, as well as the creation of void space (cavitation). Recent examples for the association of chaotropic anions to hydrophobic synthetic and biological binding sites, lipid bilayers, and surfaces are discussed."], ["Controlling an organic synthesis robot with machine learning to search for new reactivity", "The discovery of chemical reactions is an inherently unpredictable and time-consuming process(1). An attractive alternative is to predict reactivity, although relevant approaches, such as computer-aided reaction design, are still in their infancy(2). Reaction prediction based on high-level quantum chemical methods is complex(3) even for simple molecules. Although machine learning is powerful for data analysis(4,5), its applications in chemistry are still being developed'. Inspired by strategies based on chemists' intuition, we propose that a reaction system controlled by a machine learning algorithm may be able to explore the space of chemical reactions quickly, especially if trained by an expert(8). Here we present an organic synthesis robot that can perform chemical reactions and analysis faster than they can be performed manually, as well as predict the reactivity of possible reagent combinations after conducting a small number of experiments, thus effectively navigating chemical reaction space. By using machine learning for decision making, enabled by binary encoding of the chemical inputs, the reactions can be assessed in real time using nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectroscopy. The machine learning system was able to predict the reactivity of about 1,000 reaction combinations with accuracy greater than 80 per cent after considering the outcomes of slightly over 10 per cent of the dataset. This approach was also used to calculate the reactivity of published datasets. Further, by using real-time data from our robot, these predictions were followed up manually by a chemist, leading to the discovery of four reactions."], ["Clofazimine broadly inhibits coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2", "The COVID-19 pandemic is the third outbreak this century of a zoonotic disease caused by a coronavirus, following the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003(1) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012(2). Treatment options for coronaviruses are limited. Here we show that clofazimine-an anti-leprosy drug with a favourable safety profile(3)-possesses inhibitory activity against several coronaviruses, and can antagonize the replication of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV in a range of in vitro systems. We found that this molecule, which has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, inhibits cell fusion mediated by the viral spike glycoprotein, as well as activity of the viral helicase. Prophylactic or therapeutic administration of clofazimine in a hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis led to reduced viral loads in the lung and viral shedding in faeces, and also alleviated the inflammation associated with viral infection. Combinations of clofazimine and remdesivir exhibited antiviral synergy in vitro and in vivo, and restricted viral shedding from the upper respiratory tract. Clofazimine, which is orally bioavailable and comparatively cheap to manufacture, is an attractive clinical candidate for the treatment of outpatients and-when combined with remdesivir-in therapy for hospitalized patients with COVID-19, particularly in contexts in which costs are an important factor or specialized medical facilities are limited. Our data provide evidence that clofazimine may have a role in the control of the current pandemic of COVID-19 and-possibly more importantly-in dealing with coronavirus diseases that may emerge in the future."], ["Autocatalytic, bistable, oscillatory networks of biologically relevant organic reactions", "Networks of organic chemical reactions are important in life and probably played a central part in its origin(1-3). Network dynamics regulate cell division(4-6), circadian rhythms(7), nerve impulses(8) and chemotaxis(9), and guide the development of organisms(10). Although out-of-equilibrium networks of chemical reactions have the potential to display emergent network dynamics(11) such as spontaneous pattern formation, bistability and periodic oscillations(12-14), the principles that enable networks of organic reactions to develop complex behaviours are incompletely understood. Here we describe a network of biologically relevant organic reactions (amide formation, thiolate-thioester exchange, thiolate-disulfide interchange and conjugate addition) that displays bistability and oscillations in the concentrations of organic thiols and amides. Oscillations arise from the interaction between three subcomponents of the network: an autocatalytic cycle that generates thiols and amides from thioesters and dialkyl disulfides; a trigger that controls autocatalytic growth; and inhibitory processes that remove activating thiol species that are produced during the autocatalytic cycle. In contrast to previous studies that have demonstrated oscillations and bistability using highly evolved biomolecules (enzymes(15) and DNA(16,17)) or inorganic molecules of questionable biochemical relevance (for example, those used in Belousov-Zhabotinskii-type reactions)(18,19), the organic molecules we use are relevant to metabolism and similar to those that might have existed on the early Earth. By using small organic molecules to build a network of organic reactions with autocatalytic, bistable and oscillatory behaviour, we identify principles that explain the ways in which dynamic networks relevant to life could have developed. Modifications of this network will clarify the influence of molecular structure on the dynamics of reaction networks, and may enable the design of biomimetic networks and of synthetic self-regulating and evolving chemical systems."], ["Topological quantum chemistry", "Since the discovery of topological insulators and semimetals, there has been much research into predicting and experimentally discovering distinct classes of these materials, in which the topology of electronic states leads to robust surface states and electromagnetic responses. This apparent success, however, masks a fundamental shortcoming: topological insulators represent only a few hundred of the 200,000 stoichiometric compounds in material databases. However, it is unclear whether this low number is indicative of the esoteric nature of topological insulators or of a fundamental problem with the current approaches to finding them. Here we propose a complete electronic band theory, which builds on the conventional band theory of electrons, highlighting the link between the topology and local chemical bonding. This theory of topological quantum chemistry provides a description of the universal (across materials), global properties of all possible band structures and (weakly correlated) materials, consisting of a graph-theoretic description of momentum (reciprocal) space and a complementary group-theoretic description in real space. For all 230 crystal symmetry groups, we classify the possible band structures that arise from local atomic orbitals, and show which are topologically nontrivial. Our electronic band theory sheds new light on known topological insulators, and can be used to predict many more."], ["Quantitative reactivity profiling predicts functional cysteines in proteomes", "Cysteine is the most intrinsically nucleophilic amino acid in proteins, where its reactivity is tuned to perform diverse biochemical functions. The absence of a consensus sequence that defines functional cysteines in proteins has hindered their discovery and characterization. Here we describe a proteomics method to profile quantitatively the intrinsic reactivity of cysteine residues en masse directly in native biological systems. Hyper-reactivity was a rare feature among cysteines and it was found to specify a wide range of activities, including nucleophilic and reductive catalysis and sites of oxidative modification. Hyper-reactive cysteines were identified in several proteins of uncharacterized function, including a residue conserved across eukaryotic phylogeny that we show is required for yeast viability and is involved in iron-sulphur protein biogenesis. We also demonstrate that quantitative reactivity profiling can form the basis for screening and functional assignment of cysteines in computationally designed proteins, where it discriminated catalytically active from inactive cysteine hydrolase designs."], ["Alkene 1,1-difunctionalizations via organometallic-radical relay", "Radical reactions play an important role in modern organic synthetic chemistry. The generation of carbon radicals from the homolytic cleavage of carbon\u2013metal bonds has been widely studied as a fundamental step in organometallic chemistry. However, the implementation of this phenomenon in catalysed cascade reactions, that is, an organometallic-radical relay, is a highly challenging undertaking due to transient radicals generated from these thermodynamically disfavoured endergonic processes. Here we disclose a set of catalytic alkene 1,1-difunctionalization reactions conceptually based on an organometallic-radical relay. This strategy enables a diversity of sp3/sp2 fragments and aryl groups to be simultaneously introduced to the same carbon of both terminal and internal alkenes with outstanding chemo- and regioselectivity. This study provides a concept for the generation of functionalized benzylic radicals, which are difficult to access by classical protocols, from non-radical feedstock alkenes and arylboronic acids."], ["Orai1 is an essential pore subunit of the CRAC channel", "Stimulation of immune cells causes depletion of Ca2+ from endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) stores, thereby triggering sustained Ca2+ entry through store-operated Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ ( CRAC) channels, an essential signal for lymphocyte activation and proliferation(1,2). Recent evidence indicates that activation of CRAC current is initiated by STIM proteins, which sense ER Ca2+ levels through an EF-hand located in the ER lumen and relocalize upon store depletion into puncta closely associated with the plasma membrane(3-5). We and others recently identified Drosophila Orai and human Orai1 ( also called TMEM142A) as critical components of store- operated Ca2+ entry downstream of STIM6-8. Combined overexpression of Orai and Stim in Drosophila cells(8), or Orai1 and STIM1 in mammalian cells(9-11), leads to a marked increase in CRAC current. However, these experiments did not establish whether Orai is an essential intracellular link between STIM and the CRAC channel, an accessory protein in the plasma membrane, or an actual pore subunit. Here we show that Orai1 is a plasma membrane protein, and that CRAC channel function is sensitive to mutation of two conserved acidic residues in the transmembrane segments. E106D and E190Q substitutions in transmembrane helices 1 and 3, respectively, diminish Ca2+ influx, increase current carried by monovalent cations, and render the channel permeable to Cs+. These changes in ion selectivity provide strong evidence that Orai1 is a pore subunit of the CRAC channel."], ["Functional genomic hypothesis generation and experimentation by a robot scientist", "The question of whether it is possible to automate the scientific process is of both great theoretical interest(1,2) and increasing practical importance because, in many scientific areas, data are being generated much faster than they can be effectively analysed. We describe a physically implemented robotic system that applies techniques from artificial intelligence(3-8) to carry out cycles of scientific experimentation. The system automatically originates hypotheses to explain observations, devises experiments to test these hypotheses, physically runs the experiments using a laboratory robot, interprets the results to falsify hypotheses inconsistent with the data, and then repeats the cycle. Here we apply the system to the determination of gene function using deletion mutants of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and auxotrophic growth experiments(9). We built and tested a detailed logical model (involving genes, proteins and metabolites) of the aromatic amino acid synthesis pathway. In biological experiments that automatically reconstruct parts of this model, we show that an intelligent experiment selection strategy is competitive with human performance and significantly outperforms, with a cost decrease of 3-fold and 100-fold (respectively), both cheapest and random-experiment selection."], ["A comprehensive insight into the volumetric response of graphite electrodes upon sodium co-intercalation in ether-based electrolytes", "In this study, the interplay between the electrochemical behavior, structural modifications and volumetric changes of graphite-based negative electrodes for sodium ion batteries is evaluated. The electrolyte solvents chosen for this study are ethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DME), diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DEGDME), triethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TriGDME), and tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME) while the salt is sodium trifluoromethanesulfonate (NaOTf). The volume changes undergone upon co-(de)intercalation of the [Na-solvent]+ complexes are systematically investigated by means of in situ electrochemical dilatometry and correlated to the structural modification of the graphite crystalline lattice as detected by in situ X-ray diffraction. The expected staging mechanism upon co-intercalation, leading to the formation of stage-I graphite intercalation compound, is observed with all electrolytes. However, the various solvents play a substantial role on the reversibility of such structural changes in the first cycle. The effect of temperature is also investigated showing that the most stable electrochemical performance is observed with the TEGDME at room temperature, but with TriGDME at higher temperatures. Nonetheless, post-mortem scanning electron microscopy suggests that the surface layer forming after the first sodiation may dissolve in the following de-sodiation."], ["Antibacterial agents based on the cyclic D,L-\u03b1-peptide architecture", "The rapid emergence of bacterial infections that are resistant to many drugs underscores the need for new therapeutic agents(1-3). Here we report that six- and eight-residue cyclic D,L-alpha -peptides act preferentially on Gram-positive and/or Gram-negative bacterial membranes compared to mammalian cells, increase membrane permeability, collapse transmembrane ion potentials, and cause rapid cell death. The effectiveness of this class of materials as selective antibacterial agents is highlighted by the high efficacy observed against lethal methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections in mice. Cyclic D,L-alpha -peptides are proteolytically stable, easy to synthesize, and can be derived from a potentially vast membrane-active sequence space. The unique abiotic structure of the cyclic peptides and their quick bactericidal action may also contribute to limit temporal acquirement of drug resistant bacteria. The low molecular weight D,L-alpha -peptides offer an attractive complement to the current arsenal of naturally derived antibiotics, and hold considerable potential in combating a variety of existing and emerging infectious diseases."], ["Ordered macroporous materials by emulsion templating", "Ordered macroporous materials with pore diameters comparable to optical wavelengths are predicted to have unique and highly useful optical properties such as photonic bandgaps(1-3) and optical stop-bands(4). Tight control over the pore size distribution might also lead to improved macroporous materials (those with pores greater than approximately 50 nm) for application as catalytic surfaces and supports(5), adsorbents, chromatographic materials, filters(6), light-weight structural materials(7), and thermal, acoustic(8) and electrical insulators(9). Although methods exist for producing ordered porous materials with pore diameters less than 10 nm (refs 10, 11), there is no general method for producing such materials with uniform pore sizes at larger length scales. Here we report a new method for producing highly monodisperse macroporous materials with pore sizes ranging from 50 nm to several micrometres. Starting with an emulsion of equally sized droplets (produced through a repeated fractionation procedure(12)), we form macroporous materials of titania, silica and zirconia by using the emulsion droplets as templates around which material is deposited through a sol-gel process(13). Subsequent drying and heat treatment yields solid materials with spherical pores left behind by the emulsion droplets. These pores are highly ordered, reflecting the self-assembly of the original monodisperse emulsion droplets into a nearly crystalline array(14). We show that the pore size can be accurately controlled, and that the technique should be applicable to a wide variety of metal oxides and even organic polymer gels."], ["DYNAMICS OF FOLDED PROTEINS", "The dynamics of a folded globular protein (bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor) were studied by solving the equations of motion for the atoms with an empirical potential energy function.

Although they are generally believed to be Zachariasen continuous random networks(1), recent experimental evidence favours the competing crystallite model in the case of amorphous silicon(2-4). In two-dimensional materials, however, the corresponding questions remain unanswered. Here we report the synthesis, by laser-assisted chemical vapour deposition(5), of centimetre-scale, free-standing, continuous and stable monolayer amorphous carbon, topologically distinct from disordered graphene. Unlike in bulk materials, the structure of monolayer amorphous carbon can be determined by atomic-resolution imaging. Extensive characterization by Raman and X-ray spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy reveals the complete absence of long-range periodicity and a threefold-coordinated structure with a wide distribution of bond lengths, bond angles, and five-, six-, seven- and eight-member rings. The ring distribution is not a Zachariasen continuous random network, but resembles the competing (nano)crystallite model(6). We construct a corresponding model that enables density-functional-theory calculations of the properties of monolayer amorphous carbon, in accordance with observations. Direct measurements confirm that it is insulating, with resistivity values similar to those of boron nitride grown by chemical vapour deposition. Free-standing monolayer amorphous carbon is surprisingly stable and deforms to a high breaking strength, without crack propagation from the point of fracture. The excellent physical properties of this stable, free-standing monolayer amorphous carbon could prove useful for permeation and diffusion barriers in applications such as magnetic recording devices and flexible electronics."], ["Developmental pathway for potent V1V2-directed HIV-neutralizing antibodies", "Antibodies capable of neutralizing HIV-1 often target variable regions 1 and 2 (V1V2) of the HIV-1 envelope, but the mechanism of their elicitation has been unclear. Here we define the developmental pathway by which such antibodies are generated and acquire the requisite molecular characteristics for neutralization. Twelve somatically related neutralizing antibodies (CAP256-VRC26.01-12) were isolated from donor CAP256 (from the Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA)); each antibody contained the protruding tyrosine-sulphated, anionic antigen-binding loop (complementarity-determining region (CDR) H3) characteristic of this category of antibodies. Their unmutated ancestor emerged between weeks 30-38 post-infection with a 35-residue CDR H3, and neutralized the virus that superinfected this individual 15 weeks after initial infection. Improved neutralization breadth and potency occurred by week 59 with modest affinity maturation, and was preceded by extensive diversification of the virus population. HIV-1 V1V2-directed neutralizing antibodies can thus develop relatively rapidly through initial selection of B cells with a long CDR H3, and limited subsequent somatic hypermutation. These data provide important insights relevant to HIV-1 vaccine development."], ["TREX is a conserved complex coupling transcription with messenger RNA export", "The essential yeast proteins Yra1 and Sub2 are messenger RNA export factors that have conserved counterparts in metazoans, designated Aly and UAP56, respectively(1-7). These factors couple the machineries that function in splicing and export of mRNA(1-7). Here we show that both Yra1 and Sub2 are stoichiometrically associated with the heterotetrameric THO complex(8),which functions in transcription in yeast(8-11). We also show that Sub2 and Yra1 interact genetically with all four components of the THO complex (Tho2, Hpr1, Mft1 and Thp2). Moreover, these components operate in the export of bulk poly(A)(+) RNA as well as of mRNA derived from intronless genes. Both Aly and UAP56 associate with human counterparts of the THO complex. Together, these data define a conserved complex, designated the TREX ('transcription/export') complex. The TREX complex is specifically recruited to activated genes during transcription and travels the entire length of the gene with RNA polymerase II. Our data indicate that the TREX complex has a conserved role in coupling transcription to mRNA export."], ["Unbound or distant planetary mass population detected by gravitational microlensing", "Since 1995, more than 500 exoplanets have been detected using different techniques(1,2), of which 12 were detected with gravitational microlensing(3,4). Most of these are gravitationally bound to their host stars. There is some evidence of free-floating planetary-mass objects in young star-forming regions(5-8), but these objects are limited to massive objects of 3 to 15 Jupiter masses with large uncertainties in photometric mass estimates and their abundance. Here, we report the discovery of a population of unbound or distant Jupiter-mass objects, which are almost twice (1.8(-0.8)(+1.7)) as common as main-sequence stars, based on two years of gravitational microlensing survey observations towards the Galactic Bulge. These planetary-mass objects have no host stars that can be detected within about ten astronomical units by gravitational microlensing. However, a comparison with constraints from direct imaging(9) suggests that most of these planetary-mass objects are not bound to any host star. An abrupt change in the mass function at about one Jupiter mass favours the idea that their formation process is different from that of stars and brown dwarfs. They may have formed in proto-planetary disks and subsequently scattered into unbound or very distant orbits."], ["High-speed graphene transistors with a self-aligned nanowire gate", "Graphene has attracted considerable interest as a potential new electronic material(1-11). With its high carrier mobility, graphene is of particular interest for ultrahigh-speed radio-frequency electronics(12-18). However, conventional device fabrication processes cannot readily be applied to produce high-speed graphene transistors because they often introduce significant defects into the monolayer of carbon lattices and severely degrade the device performance(19-21). Here we report an approach to the fabrication of high-speed graphene transistors with a self-aligned nanowire gate to prevent such degradation. A Co(2)Si-Al(2)O(3) core-shell nanowire is used as the gate, with the source and drain electrodes defined through a self-alignment process and the channel length defined by the nanowire diameter. The physical assembly of the nanowire gate preserves the high carrier mobility in graphene, and the self-alignment process ensures that the edges of the source, drain and gate electrodes are automatically and precisely positioned so that no overlapping or significant gaps exist between these electrodes, thus minimizing access resistance. It therefore allows for transistor performance not previously possible. Graphene transistors with a channel length as low as 140 nm have been fabricated with the highest scaled on-current (3.32 mA mu m(-1)) and transconductance (1.27 mS mu m(-1)) reported so far. Significantly, on-chip microwave measurements demonstrate that the self-aligned devices have a high intrinsic cut-off (transit) frequency of f(T) = 100-300 GHz, with the extrinsic f(T) (in the range of a few gigahertz) largely limited by parasitic pad capacitance. The reported intrinsic f(T) of the graphene transistors is comparable to that of the very best high-electron-mobility transistors with similar gate lengths(10)."], ["The isotopic nature of the Earth's accreting material through time", "The Earth formed by accretion of Moon-to Mars-size embryos coming from various heliocentric distances. The isotopic nature of these bodies is unknown. However, taking meteorites as a guide, most models assume that the Earth must have formed from a heterogeneous assortment of embryos with distinct isotopic compositions(1-3). High-precision measurements, however, show that the Earth, the Moon and enstatite meteorites have almost indistinguishable isotopic compositions(4-10). Models have been proposed that reconcile the Earth-Moon similarity with the inferred heterogeneous nature of Earth-forming material, but these models either require specific geometries for the Moon-forming impact(11,12) or can explain only one aspect of the Earth-Moon similarity (that is, O-17)(1-3). Here I show that elements with distinct affinities for metal can be used to decipher the isotopic nature of the Earth's accreting material through time. I find that the mantle signatures of lithophile O, Ca, Ti and Nd, moderately siderophile Cr, Ni and Mo, and highly siderophile Ru record different stages of the Earth's accretion; yet all those elements point to material that was isotopically most similar to enstatite meteorites. This isotopic similarity indicates that the material accreted by the Earth always comprised a large fraction of enstatite-type impactors (about half were E-type in the first 60 per cent of the accretion and all of the impactors were E-type after that). Accordingly, the giant impactor that formed the Moon probably had an isotopic composition similar to that of the Earth, hence relaxing the constraints on models of lunar formation. Enstatite meteorites and the Earth were formed from the same isotopic reservoir but they diverged in their chemical evolution owing to subsequent fractionation by nebular and planetary processes(13)."], ["A regenerative approach to the treatment of multiple sclerosis", "Progressive phases of multiple sclerosis are associated with inhibited differentiation of the progenitor cell population that generates the mature oligodendrocytes required for remyelination and disease remission. To identify selective inducers of oligodendrocyte differentiation, we performed an image-based screen for myelin basic protein (MBP) expression using primary rat optic-nerve-derived progenitor cells. Here we show that among the most effective compounds identifed was benztropine, which significantly decreases clinical severity in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis when administered alone or in combination with approved immunosuppressive treatments for multiple sclerosis. Evidence from a cuprizone-inducedmodel of demyelination, in vitro and in vivo T-cell assays and EAE adoptive transfer experiments indicated that the observed efficacy of this drug results directly from an enhancement of remyelination rather than immune suppression. Pharmacological studies indicate that benztropine functions by a mechanism that involves direct antagonism of M1 and/or M3 muscarinic receptors. These studies should facilitate the development of effective new therapies for the treatment of multiple sclerosis that complement established immunosuppressive approaches."], ["Intrinsic motions along an enzymatic reaction trajectory", "The mechanisms by which enzymes achieve extraordinary rate acceleration and specificity have long been of key interest in biochemistry. It is generally recognized that substrate binding coupled to conformational changes of the substrate - enzyme complex aligns the reactive groups in an optimal environment for efficient chemistry. Although chemical mechanisms have been elucidated for many enzymes, the question of how enzymes achieve the catalytically competent state has only recently become approachable by experiment and computation. Here we show crystallographic evidence for conformational substates along the trajectory towards the catalytically competent 'closed' state in the ligand- free form of the enzyme adenylate kinase. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that these partially closed conformations are sampled in nanoseconds, whereas nuclear magnetic resonance and single- molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer reveal rare sampling of a fully closed conformation occurring on the microsecond- to- millisecond timescale. Thus, the larger- scale motions in substrate- free adenylate kinase are not random, but preferentially follow the pathways that create the configuration capable of proficient chemistry. Such preferred directionality, encoded in the fold, may contribute to catalysis in many enzymes."], ["Group 3 innate lymphoid cells mediate early protective immunity against tuberculosis", "Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death by an infectious disease worldwide1. However, the involvement of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in immune responses to infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is unknown. Here we show that circulating subsets of ILCs are depleted from the blood of participants with pulmonary tuberculosis and restored upon treatment. Tuberculosis increased accumulation of ILC subsets in the human lung, coinciding with a robust transcriptional response to infection, including a role in orchestrating the recruitment of immune subsets. Using mouse models, we show that group 3 ILCs (ILC3s) accumulated rapidly in Mtb-infected lungs and coincided with the accumulation of alveolar macrophages. Notably, mice that lacked ILC3s exhibited a reduction in the accumulation of early alveolar macrophages and decreased Mtb control. We show that the C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 5 (CXCR5)-C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 13 (CXCL13) axis is involved in Mtb control, as infection upregulates CXCR5 on circulating ILC3s and increases plasma levels of its ligand, CXCL13, in humans. Moreover, interleukin-23-dependent expansion of ILC3s in mice and production of interleukin-17 and interleukin-22 were found to be critical inducers of lung CXCL13, early innate immunity and the formation of protective lymphoid follicles within granulomas. Thus, we demonstrate an early protective role for ILC3s in immunity to Mtb infection."], ["Evidence of flat bands and correlated states in buckled graphene superlattices", "Two-dimensional atomic crystals can radically change their properties in response to external influences, such as substrate orientation or strain, forming materials with novel electronic structure(1-5). An example is the creation of weakly dispersive, 'flat' bands in bilayer graphene for certain 'magic' angles of twist between the orientations of the two layers(6). The quenched kinetic energy in these flat bands promotes electron-electron interactions and facilitates the emergence of strongly correlated phases, such as superconductivity and correlated insulators. However, the very accurate fine-tuning required to obtain the magic angle in twisted-bilayer graphene poses challenges to fabrication and scalability. Here we present an alternative route to creating flat bands that does not involve fine-tuning. Using scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy, together with numerical simulations, we demonstrate that graphene monolayers placed on an atomically flat substrate can be forced to undergo a buckling transition(7-9), resulting in a periodically modulated pseudo-magnetic field(10-14), which in turn creates a 'post-graphene' material with flat electronic bands. When we introduce the Fermi level into these flat bands using electrostatic doping, we observe a pseudogap-like depletion in the density of states, which signals the emergence of a correlated state(15-17). This buckling of two-dimensional crystals offers a strategy for creating other superlattice systems and, in particular, for exploring interaction phenomena characteristic of flat bands. Buckled monolayer graphene superlattices are found to provide an alternative to twisted bilayer graphene for the study of flat bands and correlated states in a carbon-based material."], ["Self-assembly of DNA into nanoscale three-dimensional shapes", "Molecular self-assembly offers a 'bottom-up' route to fabrication with subnanometre precision of complex structures from simple components(1). DNA has proved to be a versatile building block(2-5) for programmable construction of such objects, including two-dimensional crystals(6), nanotubes(7-11), and three-dimensional wire-frame nanopolyhedra(12-17). Templated self-assembly of DNA(18) into custom two-dimensional shapes on the megadalton scale has been demonstrated previously with a multiple-kilobase 'scaffold strand' that is folded into a flat array of antiparallel helices by interactions with hundreds of oligonucleotide 'staple strands'(19,20). Here we extend this method to building custom three-dimensional shapes formed as pleated layers of helices constrained to a honeycomb lattice. We demonstrate the design and assembly of nanostructures approximating six shapes-monolith, square nut, railed bridge, genie bottle, stacked cross, slotted cross-with precisely controlled dimensions ranging from 10 to 100 nm. We also show hierarchical assembly of structures such as homomultimeric linear tracks and heterotrimeric wireframe icosahedra. Proper assembly requires week-long folding times and calibrated monovalent and divalent cation concentrations. We anticipate that our strategy for self-assembling custom three-dimensional shapes will provide a general route to the manufacture of sophisticated devices bearing features on the nanometre scale."], ["Comparative population genomics in animals uncovers the determinants of genetic diversity", "Genetic diversity is the amount of variation observed between DNA sequences from distinct individuals of a given species. This pivotal concept of population genetics has implications for species health, domestication, management and conservation. Levels of genetic diversity seem to vary greatly in natural populations and species, but the determinants of this variation, and particularly the relative influences of species biology and ecology versus population history, are still largely mysterious(1,2). Here we show that the diversity of a species is predictable, and is determined in the first place by its ecological strategy. We investigated the genome-wide diversity of 76 non-model animal species by sequencing the transcriptome of two to ten individuals in each species. The distribution of genetic diversity between species revealed no detectable influence of geographic range or invasive status but was accurately predicted by key species traits related to parental investment: long-lived or low-fecundity species with brooding ability were genetically less diverse than short-lived or highly fecund ones. Our analysis demonstrates the influence of long-term life-history strategies on species response to short-term environmental perturbations, a result with immediate implications for conservation policies."], ["Stable colloids in molten inorganic salts", "A colloidal solution is a homogeneous dispersion of particles or droplets of one phase (solute) in a second, typically liquid, phase (solvent). Colloids are ubiquitous in biological, chemical and technological processes(1,2), homogenizing highly dissimilar constituents. To stabilize a colloidal system against coalescence and aggregation, the surface of each solute particle is engineered to impose repulsive forces strong enough to overpower van der Waals attraction and keep the particles separated from each other(2). Electrostatic stabilization(3,4) of charged solutes works well in solvents with high dielectric constants, such as water (dielectric constant of 80). In contrast, colloidal stabilization in solvents with low polarity, such as hexane (dielectric constant of about 2), can be achieved by decorating the surface of each particle of the solute with molecules (surfactants) containing flexible, brush-like chains(2,5). Here we report a class of colloidal systems in which solute particles (including metals, semiconductors and magnetic materials) form stable colloids in various molten inorganic salts. The stability of such colloids cannot be explained by traditional electrostatic and steric mechanisms. Screening of many solute-solvent combinations shows that colloidal stability can be traced to the strength of chemical bonding at the solute-solvent interface. Theoretical analysis and molecular dynamics modelling suggest that a layer of surface-bound solvent ions produces long-ranged charge-density oscillations in the molten salt around solute particles, preventing their aggregation. Colloids composed of inorganic particles in inorganic melts offer opportunities for introducing colloidal techniques to solid-state science and engineering applications."], ["Human gut bacteria produce T<sub>H</sub>17-modulating bile acid metabolites", "The microbiota modulates gut immune homeostasis. Bacteria influence the development and function of host immune cells, including T helper cells expressing interleukin-17A (T(H)17 cells). We previously reported that the bile acid metabolite 3-oxolithocholic acid (3-oxoLCA) inhibits T(H)17 cell differentiation(1). Although it was suggested that gut-residing bacteria produce 3-oxoLCA, the identity of such bacteria was unknown, and it was unclear whether 3-oxoLCA and other immunomodulatory bile acids are associated with inflammatory pathologies in humans. Here we identify human gut bacteria and corresponding enzymes that convert the secondary bile acid lithocholic acid into 3-oxoLCA as well as the abundant gut metabolite isolithocholic acid (isoLCA). Similar to 3-oxoLCA, isoLCA suppressed T(H)17 cell differentiation by inhibiting retinoic acid receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor-gamma t, a key T H 17-cell-promoting transcription factor. The levels of both 3-oxoLCA and isoLCA and the 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase genes that are required for their biosynthesis were significantly reduced in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Moreover, the levels of these bile acids were inversely correlated with the expression of T(H)17-cell-associated genes. Overall, our data suggest that bacterially produced bile acids inhibit T(H)17 cell function, an activity that may be relevant to the pathophysiology of inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease."], ["Uniform nucleation and epitaxy of bilayer molybdenum disulfide on sapphire", "Two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are of interest for beyond-silicon electronics(1,2). It has been suggested that bilayer TMDs, which combine good electrostatic control, smaller bandgap and higher mobility than monolayers, could potentially provide improvements in the energy-delay product of transistors(3-5). However, despite advances in the growth of monolayer TMDs(6-14), the controlled epitaxial growth of multilayers remains a challenge(15). Here we report the uniform nucleation (>99%) of bilayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) on c-plane sapphire. In particular, we engineer the atomic terrace height on c-plane sapphire to enable an edge-nucleation mechanism and the coalescence of MoS2 domains into continuous, centimetre-scale films. Fabricated field-effect transistor (FET) devices based on bilayer MoS2 channels show substantial improvements in mobility (up to 122.6 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)) and variation compared with FETs based on monolayer films. Furthermore, short-channel FETs exhibit an on-state current of 1.27 mA mu m(-1), which exceeds the 2028 roadmap target for high-performance FETs16."], ["Structure of native lens connexin 46/50 intercellular channels by cryo-EM", "Gap junctions establish direct pathways for cell-to-cell communication through the assembly of twelve connexin subunits that form intercellular channels connecting neighbouring cells. Co-assembly of different connexin isoforms produces channels with unique properties and enables communication across cell types. Here we used single-particle cryo-electron microscopy to investigate the structural basis of connexin co-assembly in native lens gap junction channels composed of connexin 46 and connexin 50 (Cx46/50). We provide the first comparative analysis to connexin 26 (Cx26), which-together with computational studies-elucidates key energetic features governing gap junction permselectivity. Cx46/50 adopts an open-state conformation that is distinct from the Cx26 crystal structure, yet it appears to be stabilized by a conserved set of hydrophobic anchoring residues. 'Hot spots' of genetic mutations linked to hereditary cataract formation map to the core structural-functional elements identified in Cx46/50, suggesting explanations for many of the disease-causing effects."], ["Ferroelectric switching of a two-dimensional metal", "A ferroelectric is a material with a polar structure whose polarity can be reversed (switched) by applying an electric field(1,2). In metals, itinerant electrons screen electrostatic forces between ions, which explains in part why polar metals are very rare(3-7). Screening also excludes external electric fields, apparently ruling out the possibility of ferroelectric switching. However, in principle, a thin enough polar metal could be sufficiently penetrated by an electric field to have its polarity switched. Here we show that the topological semimetal WTe2 provides an embodiment of this principle. Although monolayer WTe2 is centro-symmetric and thus non-polar, the stacked bulk structure is polar. We find that two-or three-layer WTe2 exhibits spontaneous out-of-plane electric polarization that can be switched using gate electrodes. We directly detect and quantify the polarization using graphene as an electric-field sensor(8). Moreover, the polarization states can be differentiated by conductivity and the carrier density can be varied to modify the properties. The temperature at which polarization vanishes is above 350 kelvin, and even when WTe2 is sandwiched between graphene layers it retains its switching capability at room temperature, demonstrating a robustness suitable for applications in combination with other two-dimensional materials(9-12)."], ["Dynamic regulatory network controlling T<sub>H</sub>17 cell differentiation", "Despite their importance, the molecular circuits that control the differentiation of naive T cells remain largely unknown. Recent studies that reconstructed regulatory networks in mammalian cells have focused on short-term responses and relied on perturbation-based approaches that cannot be readily applied to primary T cells. Here we combine transcriptional profiling at high temporal resolution, novel computational algorithms, and innovative nanowire-based perturbation tools to systematically derive and experimentally validate a model of the dynamic regulatory network that controls the differentiation of mouse T(H)17 cells, a proinflammatory T-cell subset that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple autoimmune diseases. The T(H)17 transcriptional network consists of two self-reinforcing, but mutually antagonistic, modules, with 12 novel regulators, the coupled action of which may be essential for maintaining the balance between T(H)17 and other CD41 T-cell subsets. Our study identifies and validates 39 regulatory factors, embeds them within a comprehensive temporal network and reveals its organizational principles; it also highlights novel drug targets for controlling T(H)17 cell differentiation."], ["Optical alignment and spinning of laser-trapped microscopic particles", "Light-induced rotation of absorbing microscopic particles by transfer of angular mometum from light ao the material raises the possibility of optically driven microsmachines. The phenomenon has been observed using elliptically polarized laser beams(1) or beams with helical phase structure(2,3). But it is difficult to develop high power in such experiments because of overheating and unwanted axial forces, limiting the achievable rotation rates to a few hertz. This problem can in principle be overcome by using transparent particles, transferring angular momentum by a mechanism first observed by Beth in 1936(4), when he reported a tiny torque developed in a quartz 'wave-plate' owing to the change in polarization of transmitted light. Here we show that an optical torque can be induced on microscopic birefringent particles of calcite held by optical tweezers(5). Depending on the polarization of the incident beam, the particles either become aligned with the plane of polarization (and thus can be rotated through specified angles) or spin with constant rotation frequency. Because these microscopic particles are transparent, they can be held, in three-dimensional optical traps at very high power without beating, leading to rotation rates of over 350 Hz."], ["A designed photoenzyme for enantioselective [2+2] cycloadditions", "The ability to program new modes of catalysis into proteins would allow the development of enzyme families with functions beyond those found in nature. To this end, genetic code expansion methodology holds particular promise, as it allows the site-selective introduction of new functional elements into proteins as noncanonical amino acid side chains(1-4). Here we exploit an expanded genetic code to develop a photoenzyme that operates by means oftriplet energy transfer (EnT) catalysis, a versatile mode of reactivity in organic synthesis that is not accessible to biocatalysis at present(5-)(12). Installation of a genetically encoded photosensitizer into the beta-propeller scaffold of DA_20_00 (ref.(13)) converts a de novo Diels-Alderase into a photoenzyme for [2+2] cycloadditions (EnT1.0). Subsequent development and implementation of a platform for photoenzyme evolution afforded an efficient and enantioselective enzyme (EnT1.3, up to 99% enantiomeric excess (e.e.)) that can promote intramolecular and bimolecular cycloadditions, including transformations that have proved challenging to achieve selectively with small-molecule catalysts. EnT1.3 performs >300 turnovers and, in contrast to small-molecule photocatalysts, can operate effectively under aerobic conditions and at ambient temperatures. An X-ray crystal structure of an EnT1.3-product complex shows how multiple functional components work in synergy to promote efficient and selective photocatalysis. This study opens up a wealth of new excited-state chemistry in protein active sites and establishes the framework for developing a new generation of enantioselective photocatalysts."], ["Evidence for dynamically organized modularity in the yeast protein-protein interaction network", "In apparently scale-free protein-protein interaction networks, or 'interactome' networks(1,2), most proteins interact with few partners, whereas a small but significant proportion of proteins, the 'hubs', interact with many partners. Both biological and nonbiological scale-free networks are particularly resistant to random node removal but are extremely sensitive to the targeted removal of hubs(1). A link between the potential scale-free topology of interactome networks and genetic robustness(3,4) seems to exist, because knockouts of yeast genes(5,6) encoding hubs are approximately threefold more likely to confer lethality than those of non-hubs(1). Here we investigate how hubs might contribute to robustness and other cellular properties for protein protein interactions dynamically regulated both in time and in space. We uncovered two types of hub: 'party' hubs, which interact with most of their partners simultaneously, and 'date' hubs, which bind their different partners at different times or locations. Both in silico studies of network connectivity and genetic interactions described in vivo support a model of organized modularity in which date hubs organize the proteome, connecting biological processes-or modules(7)-to each other, whereas party hubs function inside modules."], ["Strong present-day aerosol cooling implies a hot future", "Atmospheric aerosols counteract the warming effects of anthropogenic greenhouse gases by an uncertain, but potentially large, amount. This in turn leads to large uncertainties in the sensitivity of climate to human perturbations, and therefore also in carbon cycle feedbacks and projections of climate change. In the future, aerosol cooling is expected to decline relative to greenhouse gas forcing, because of the aerosols' much shorter lifetime and the pursuit of a cleaner atmosphere. Strong aerosol cooling in the past and present would then imply that future global warming may proceed at or even above the upper extreme of the range projected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change."], ["High-temperature superconductivity in monolayer Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>CaCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8+\u03b4</sub>", "Although copper oxide high-temperature superconductors constitute a complex and diverse material family, they all share a layered lattice structure. This curious fact prompts the question of whether high-temperature superconductivity can exist in an isolated monolayer of copper oxide, and if so, whether the two-dimensional superconductivity and various related phenomena differ from those of their three-dimensional counterparts. The answers may provide insights into the role of dimensionality in high-temperature superconductivity. Here we develop a fabrication process that obtains intrinsic monolayer crystals of the high-temperature superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta (Bi-2212; here, a monolayer refers to a half unit cell that contains two CuO2 planes). The highest superconducting transition temperature of the monolayer is as high as that of optimally doped bulk. The lack of dimensionality effect on the transition temperature defies expectations from the Mermin-Wagner theorem, in contrast to the much-reduced transition temperature in conventional two-dimensional superconductors such as NbSe2. The properties of monolayer Bi-2212 become extremely tunable; our survey of superconductivity, the pseudogap, charge order and the Mott state at various doping concentrations reveals that the phases are indistinguishable from those in the bulk. Monolayer Bi-2212 therefore displays all the fundamental physics of high-temperature superconductivity. Our results establish monolayer copper oxides as a platform for studying high-temperature superconductivity and other strongly correlated phenomena in two dimensions."], ["Catalogue of topological electronic materials", "Topological electronic materials such as bismuth selenide, tantalum arsenide and sodium bismuthide show unconventional linear response in the bulk, as well as anomalous gapless states at their boundaries. They are of both fundamental and applied interest, with the potential for use in high-performance electronics and quantum computing. But their detection has so far been hindered by the difficulty of calculating topological invariant properties (or topological nodes), which requires both experience with materials and expertise with advanced theoretical tools. Here we introduce an effective, efficient and fully automated algorithm that diagnoses the nontrivial band topology in a large fraction of nonmagnetic materials. Our algorithm is based on recently developed exhaustive mappings between the symmetry representations of occupied bands and topological invariants. We sweep through a total of 39,519 materials available in a crystal database, and find that as many as 8,056 of them are topologically nontrivial.

This momentous discovery is among the experimental cornerstones of Einstein's special relativity theory and is well understood(3,4) in the context of relativistic kinematics. By contrast, experiments on dragging photons by an electron flow in solids are riddled with inconsistencies and have so far eluded agreement with the theory(5-7). Here we report on the electron flow dragging surface plasmon polaritons(8,9) (SPPs): hybrid quasiparticles of infrared photons and electrons in graphene. The drag is visualized directly through infrared nano-imaging of propagating plasmonic waves in the presence of a high-density current. The polaritons in graphene shorten their wavelength when propagating against the drifting carriers. Unlike the Fizeau effect for light, the SPP drag by electrical currents defies explanation by simple kinematics and is linked to the nonlinear electrodynamics of Dirac electrons in graphene. The observed plasmonic Fizeau drag enables breaking of time-reversal symmetry and reciprocity(10) at infrared frequencies without resorting to magnetic fields(11,12) or chiral optical pumping(13,14). The Fizeau drag also provides a tool with which to study interactions and nonequilibrium effects in electron liquids."], ["Discovery of intrinsic ferromagnetism in two-dimensional van der Waals crystals", "The realization of long-range ferromagnetic order in two-dimensional van der Waals crystals, combined with their rich electronic and optical properties, could lead to new magnetic, magnetoelectric and magneto-optic applications(1-4). In two-dimensional systems, the long-range magnetic order is strongly suppressed by thermal fluctuations, according to the Mermin-Wagner theorem(5); however, these thermal fluctuations can be counteracted by magnetic anisotropy. Previous efforts, based on defect and composition engineering(6-10), or the proximity effect, introduced magnetic responses only locally or extrinsically. Here we report intrinsic long-range ferromagnetic order in pristine Cr2Ge2Te6 atomic layers, as revealed by scanning magneto-optic Kerr microscopy. In this magnetically soft, two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnet, we achieve unprecedented control of the transition temperature (between ferromagnetic and paramagnetic states) using very small fields (smaller than 0.3 tesla). This result is in contrast to the insensitivity of the transition temperature to magnetic fields in the three-dimensional regime. We found that the small applied field leads to an effective anisotropy that is much greater than the near-zero magnetocrystalline anisotropy, opening up a large spin-wave excitation gap. We explain the observed phenomenon using renormalized spin-wave theory and conclude that the unusual field dependence of the transition temperature is a hallmark of soft, two-dimensional ferromagnetic van der Waals crystals. Cr2Ge2Te6 is a nearly ideal two-dimensional Heisenberg ferromagnet and so will be useful for studying fundamental spin behaviours, opening the door to exploring new applications such as ultra-compact spintronics."], ["Strong quantum-confined Stark effect in germanium quantum-well structures on silicon", "Silicon is the dominant semiconductor for electronics, but there is now a growing need to integrate such components with optoelectronics for telecommunications and computer interconnections(1). Silicon-based optical modulators have recently been successfully demonstrated(2,3); but because the light modulation mechanisms in silicon(4) are relatively weak, long ( for example, several millimetres) devices(2) or sophisticated high-quality-factor resonators(3) have been necessary. Thin quantum-well structures made from III-V semiconductors such as GaAs, InP and their alloys exhibit the much stronger quantum-confined Stark effect (QCSE) mechanism(5), which allows modulator structures with only micrometres of optical path length(6,7). Such III-V materials are unfortunately difficult to integrate with silicon electronic devices. Germanium is routinely integrated with silicon in electronics(8), but previous silicon - germanium structures have also not shown strong modulation effects(9-13). Here we report the discovery of the QCSE, at room temperature, in thin germanium quantum-well structures grown on silicon. The QCSE here has strengths comparable to that in III-V materials. Its clarity and strength are particularly surprising because germanium is an indirect gap semiconductor; such semiconductors often display much weaker optical effects than direct gap materials ( such as the III-V materials typically used for optoelectronics).

A fourth phase, of unknown identity, occurs at light doping along the zero-temperature bound of the 'pseudogap' regime(1). This regime is rich in peculiar electronic phenomena(1), prompting numerous proposals that it contains some form of hidden electronic order. Here we present low-temperature electronic structure imaging studies of a lightly hole-doped copper oxide: Ca2-xNaxCuO2Cl2. Tunnelling spectroscopy (at energies \\E\\ > 100 meV) reveals electron extraction probabilities greatly exceeding those for injection, as anticipated for a doped Mott insulator. However, for \\E\\ < 100 meV, the spectrum exhibits a V-shaped energy gap centred on E = 0. States within this gap undergo intense spatial modulations, with the spatial correlations of a four CuO2-unit-cell square 'checkerboard', independent of energy. Intricate atomic-scale electronic structure variations also exist within the checkerboard.

However, the mechanical responses of soft tissues and semiflexible polymer gels differ in many respects. Tissues stiffen in compression but not in extension(1-5), whereas semiflexible polymer networks soften in compression and stiffen in extension(6,7). In shear deformation, semiflexible polymer gels stiffen with increasing strain, but tissues do not(1-8). Here we use multiple experimental systems and a theoretical model to show that a combination of nonlinear polymer network elasticity and particle (cell) inclusions is essential to mimic tissue mechanics that cannot be reproduced by either biopolymer networks or colloidal particle systems alone. Tissue rheology emerges from an interplay between strain-stiffening polymer networks and volume-conserving cells within them. Polymer networks that soften in compression but stiffen in extension can be converted to materials that stiffen in compression but not in extension by including within the network either cells or inert particles to restrict the relaxation modes of the fibrous networks that surround them. Particle inclusions also suppress stiffening in shear deformation; when the particle volume fraction is low, they have little effect on the elasticity of the polymer networks. However, as the particles become more closely packed, the material switches from compression softening to compression stiffening. The emergence of an elastic response in these composite materials has implications for how tissue stiffness is altered in disease and can lead to cellular dysfunction(9-11). Additionally, the findings could be used in the design of biomaterials with physiologically relevant mechanical properties."], ["High-fidelity readout and control of a nuclear spin qubit in silicon", "Detection of nuclear spin precession is critical for a wide range of scientific techniques that have applications in diverse fields including analytical chemistry, materials science, medicine and biology. Fundamentally, it is possible because of the extreme isolation of nuclear spins from their environment. This isolation also makes single nuclear spins desirable for quantum-information processing, as shown by pioneering studies on nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond(1-4). The nuclear spin of a P-31 donor in silicon is very promising as a quantum bit(5): bulk measurements indicate that it has excellent coherence times(6,7) and silicon is the dominant material in the microelectronics industry. Here we demonstrate electrical detection and coherent manipulation of a single P-31 nuclear spin qubit with sufficiently high fidelities for fault-tolerant quantum computing(8). By integrating single-shot readout of the electron spin(9) with on-chip electron spin resonance(10), we demonstrate quantum non-demolition(11) and electrical single-shot readout of the nuclear spin with a readout fidelity higher than 99.8 per cent-the highest so far reported for any solid-state qubit. The single nuclear spin is then operated as a qubit by applying coherent radio-frequency pulses. For an ionized P-31 donor, we find a nuclear spin coherence time of 60 milliseconds and a one-qubit gate control fidelity exceeding 98 per cent.

Here we present an integrated solid-state Li-air battery that contains an ultrathin, high-ion-conductive lithium-ion-exchanged zeolite X (LiX) membrane as the sole solid electrolyte. This electrolyte is integrated with cast lithium as the anode and carbon nanotubes as the cathode using an in situ assembly strategy. Owing to the intrinsic chemical stability of the zeolite, degeneration of the electrolyte from the effects of lithium or air is effectively suppressed. The battery has a capacity of 12,020 milliamp hours per gram of carbon nanotubes, and has a cycle life of 149 cycles at a current density of 500 milliamps per gram and at a capacity of 1,000 milliamp hours per gram. This cycle life is greater than those of batteries based on lithium aluminium germanium phosphate (12 cycles) and organic electrolytes (102 cycles) under the same conditions.

Despite the fact that only about 1% of the total marine primary production of organic carbon is available for deep-sea microorganisms(7,8), subseafloor sediments harbour over half of all prokaryotic cells on Earth(7). This estimation has been calculated from numerous microscopic cell counts in sediment cores of the Ocean Drilling Program(1,9). Because these counts cannot differentiate between dead and alive cells, the population size of living microorganisms is unknown(10,11). Here, using ribosomal RNA as a target for the technique known as catalysed reporter deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH), we provide direct quantification of live cells as defined by the presence of ribosomes. We show that a large fraction of the sub-seafloor prokaryotes is alive, even in very old (16 million yr) and deep (>400 m) sediments.

Deubiquitinases remove ubiquitin from proteins, and their inhibition can induce the degradation of selected proteins, potentially including otherwise 'undruggable' targets. For example, the inhibition of ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7) results in the degradation of the oncogenic E3 ligase MDM2, and leads to re-activation of the tumour suppressor p53 in various cancers. Here we report that two compounds, FT671 and FT827, inhibit USP7 with high affinity and specificity in vitro and within human cells. Co-crystal structures reveal that both compounds target a dynamic pocket near the catalytic centre of the auto-inhibited apo form of USP7, which differs from other USP deubiquitinases. Consistent with USP7 target engagement in cells, FT671 destabilizes USP7 substrates including MDM2, increases levels of p53, and results in the transcription of p53 target genes, induction of the tumour suppressor p21, and inhibition of tumour growth in mice."], ["Water activity as the determinant for homogeneous ice nucleation in aqueous solutions", "The unique properties of water in the supercooled (metastable) state are not fully understood(1). In particular, the effects of solutes and mechanical pressure on the kinetics of the liquid-to-solid phase transition of supercooled water and aqueous solutions to ice have remained unresolved. Here we show from experimental data that the homogeneous nucleation of ice from supercooled aqueous solutions is independent of the nature of the solute, but depends only on the water activity of the solution-that is, the ratio between the water vapour pressures of the solution and of pure water under the same conditions. In addition, we show that the presence of solutes and the application of pressure have a very similar effect on ice nucleation. We present a thermodynamic theory for homogeneous ice nucleation, which expresses the nucleation rate coefficient as a function of water activity and pressure. Recent observations from clouds containing ice are in good agreement with our theory and our results should help to overcome one of the main weaknesses of numerical models of the atmosphere, the formulation of cloud processes."], ["Biogenically driven organic contribution to marine aerosol", "Marine aerosol contributes significantly to the global aerosol load and consequently has an important impact on both the Earth's albedo and climate. So far, much of the focus on marine aerosol has centred on the production of aerosol from sea-salt(1) and non-sea-salt sulphates(2,3). Recent field experiments, however, have shown that known aerosol production processes for inorganic species cannot account for the entire aerosol mass that occurs in submicrometre sizes(4-6). Several experimental studies have pointed to the presence of significant concentrations of organic matter in marine aerosol(7-11). There is some information available about the composition of organic matter(12-14), but the contribution of organic matter to marine aerosol, as a function of aerosol size, as well as its characterization as hydrophilic or hydrophobic, has been lacking. Here we measure the physical and chemical characteristics of submicrometre marine aerosol over the North Atlantic Ocean during plankton blooms progressing from spring through to autumn. We find that during bloom periods, the organic fraction dominates and contributes 63% to the submicrometre aerosol mass (about 45% is water-insoluble and about 18% water-soluble). In winter, when biological activity is at its lowest, the organic fraction decreases to 15%. Our model simulations indicate that organic matter can enhance the cloud droplet concentration by 15% to more than 100% and is therefore an important component of the aerosol-cloud-climate feedback system involving marine biota."], ["One-dimensional Luttinger liquids in a two-dimensional moire lattice", "The Luttinger liquid (LL) model of one-dimensional (1D) electronic systems provides a powerful tool for understanding strongly correlated physics, including phenomena such as spin-charge separation(1). Substantial theoretical efforts have attempted to extend the LL phenomenology to two dimensions, especially in models of closely packed arrays of 1D quantum wires(2-13), each being described as a LL. Such coupled-wire models have been successfully used to construct two-dimensional (2D) anisotropic non-Fermi liquids(2-6), quantum Hall states(7-9), topological phases(10,11) and quantum spin liquids(12,13). However, an experimental demonstration of high-quality arrays of 1D LLs suitable for realizing these models remains absent. Here we report the experimental realization of 2D arrays of 1D LLs with crystalline quality in a moire superlattice made of twisted bilayer tungsten ditelluride (tWTe(2)). Originating from the anisotropic lattice of the monolayer, the moire pattern of tWTe(2) hosts identical, parallel 1D electronic channels, separated by a fixed nanoscale distance, which is tuneable by the interlayer twist angle. At a twist angle of approximately 5 degrees, we find that hole-doped tWTe(2) exhibits exceptionally large transport anisotropy with a resistance ratio of around 1,000 between two orthogonal in-plane directions. The across-wire conductance exhibits power-law scaling behaviours, consistent with the formation of a 2D anisotropic phase that resembles an array of LLs. Our results open the door for realizing a variety of correlated and topological quantum phases based on coupled-wire models and LL physics."], ["Teraelectronvolt emission from the \u03b3-ray burst GRB 190114C", "Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most luminous sources of electromagnetic radiation known in the Universe. They arise from outflows of plasma with velocities near the speed of light that are ejected by newly formed neutron stars or black holes (of stellar mass) at cosmological distances(1,2). Prompt flashes of megaelectronvoltenergy gamma-rays are followed by a longer-lasting afterglow emission in a wide range of energies (from radio waves to gigaelectronvolt gamma-rays), which originates from synchrotron radiation generated by energetic electrons in the accompanying shock waves(3,4). Although emission of gamma-rays at even higher (teraelectronvolt) energies by other radiation mechanisms has been theoretically predicted(5-8), it has not been previously detected(7,8). Here we report observations of teraelectronvolt emission from the gamma-ray burst GRB 190114C. gamma-rays were observed in the energy range 0.2-1 teraelectronvolt from about one minute after the burst (at more than 50 standard deviations in the first 20 minutes), revealing a distinct emission component of the afterglow with power comparable to that of the synchrotron component. The observed similarity in the radiated power and temporal behaviour of the teraelectronvolt and X-ray bands points to processes such as inverse Compton upscattering as the mechanism of the teraelectronvolt emission(9-11). By contrast, processes such as synchrotron emission by ultrahigh-energy protons(10,12,13) are not favoured because of their low radiative efficiency. These results are anticipated to be a step towards a deeper understanding of the physics of GRBs and relativistic shock waves."], ["Hydrogen trapping and embrittlement in high-strength Al alloys", "Ever more stringent regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from transportation motivate effortsto revisit materials used for vehicles(1). High-strength aluminium alloys often used in aircrafts could help reduce the weight of automobiles, but are susceptible to environmental degradation(2,3). Hydrogen 'embrittlement' is often indicated as the main culprit(4): however, the exact mechanisms underpinning failure are not precisely known: atomic-scale analysis of H inside an alloy remains a challenge, and this prevents deploying alloy design strategiesto enhance the durability of the materials. Here we performed near-atomic-scale analysis of H trapped in second-phase particles and at grain boundaries in a high-strength 7xxx Al alloy. We used these observations to guide atomistic ab initio calculations, which showthat the co-segregation of alloying elements and H favours grain boundary decohesion, and the strong partitioning of H into the second-phase particles removes solute H from the matrix, hence preventing H embrittlement. Our insights further advance the mechanistic understanding of H-assisted embrittlement in Al alloys, emphasizing the role of H traps in minimizing cracking and guiding new alloy design."], ["Two-electron redox chemistry via single-atom catalyst for reversible zinc\u2013air batteries", "Rechargeable zinc\u2013air batteries (ZABs) are considered to be one of the most sustainable alternative systems in a post-lithium-ion future owing to their lowest possible dependency on critical raw materials and high theoretical energy densities. However, their performance is still not up to par with their potential because of the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction. Here we report a single-atom catalyst design that transforms the sluggish four-electron oxygen reduction reaction into a fast two-electron pathway and enables a zinc peroxide (ZnO2) chemistry in ZABs. With accessible FeN2S2 active sites on mesoporous graphene, the catalyst serves to promote transport of electrolyte, oxygen and electron and confines the growth of ZnO2, which would otherwise form dead products. As a result, as-fabricated ZAB in a neutral electrolyte shows a voltage as high as 1.2\u2009V at 0.2\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122, a high round-trip efficiency of 61% and an excellent operation stability beyond \u223c400\u2009h.

We develop codes to compute all characters of all symmetries of 26,938 stoichiometric materials, and find 3,307 topological insulators, 4,078 topological semimetals and no fragile phases. For these 7,385 materials we provide the electronic band structure, including some electronic properties (bandgap and number of electrons), symmetry indicators, and other topological information. Our results show that more than 27 per cent of all materials in nature are topological. We provide an open-source code that checks the topology of any material and allows other researchers to reproduce our results."], ["A very luminous jet from the disruption of a star by a massive black hole", "Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are bursts of electromagnetic energy that are released when supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies violently disrupt a star that passes too close(1). TDEs provide a window through which to study accretion onto supermassive black holes; in some rare cases, this accretion leads to launching of a relativistic jet(2-9), but the necessary conditions are not fully understood. The best-studied jetted TDE so far is Swift J1644+57, which was discovered in.-rays, but was too obscured by dust to be seen at optical wavelengths. Here we report the optical detection of AT2022cmc, a rapidly fading source at cosmological distance (redshift z = 1.19325) the unique light curve of which transitioned into a luminous plateau within days. Observations of a bright counterpart at other wavelengths, including X-ray, submillimetre and radio, supports the interpretation of AT2022cmc as a jetted TDE containing a synchrotron 'afterglow', probably launched by a supermassive black hole with spin greater than approximately 0.3. Using four years of Zwicky Transient Facility(10) survey data, we calculate a rate of 0.02(-0.01)(+0.04) Gpc(-3) yr(-1) for on-axis jetted TDEs on the basis of the luminous, fast-fading red component, thus providing a measurement complementary to the rates derived from X-ray and radio observations(11). Correcting for the beaming angle effects, this rate confirms that approximately 1 per cent of TDEs have relativistic jets. Optical surveys can use AT2022cmc as a prototype to unveil a population of jetted TDEs."], ["Transition-metal-free C(sp2)\u2013C(sp3) cross-coupling of \u03b1-(pseudo)halo aliphatic ketones with boronic acids via a 1,4-metallate shift", "Suzuki-type cross-coupling is one of the most common strategies for the construction of C\u2013C bonds. Despite great progress on the preparation of C(sp2)\u2013C(sp2) bonds, C(sp2)\u2013C(sp3) cross-coupling with aliphatic halides remains rare, especially with tertiary aliphatic halides and under transition-metal-free conditions. Here we report an efficient C(sp2)\u2013C(sp3) cross-coupling between \u03b1-(pseudo)halo aliphatic ketones and arylboronic acids via a 1,4-metallate shift. The \u03b1-arylated ketones obtained from this protocol under transition-metal-free and additive-free conditions in the presence of base are formed when the key intermediate enolate traps the arylboronic acid, leading to a tetracoordinate boron intermediate. A subsequent 1,4-metallate shift affords the Suzuki-type coupling products. This strategy provides a practical, scalable and operationally straightforward method for the synthesis of C(sp2)\u2013C(sp3) bonds, and is compatible with challenging tertiary aliphatic halides, allowing for the preparation of 1,3-disubstituted target products."], ["Molybdenum-catalysed ammonia production with samarium diiodide and alcohols or water", "The production of ammonia from nitrogen gas is one of the most important industrial processes, owing to the use of ammonia as a raw material for nitrogen fertilizers. Currently, the main method of ammonia production is the Haber-Bosch process, which operates under very high temperatures and pressures and is therefore very energy-intensive(1). The transition-metal-catalysed reduction of nitrogen gas(2-6) is an alternative method for the formation of ammonia. In these reaction systems, metallocenes or potassium graphite are typically used as the reducing reagent, and conjugate acids of pyridines or related compounds are used as a proton source. To develop a next-generation nitrogen-fixation system, these reagents should be low cost, readily available and environmentally friendly. Here we show that the combination of samarium(II) diiodide (SmI2) with alcohols or water enables the fixation of nitrogen to be catalysed by molybdenum complexes under ambient conditions. Up to 4,350 equivalents of ammonia can be produced (based on the molybdenum catalyst), with a turnover frequency of around 117 per minute. The amount of ammonia produced and its rate of formation are one and two orders of magnitude larger, respectively, than those achieved in artificial reaction systems reported so far, and the formation rate approaches that observed with nitrogenase enzymes. The high reactivity is achieved by a proton-coupled electron-transfer process that is enabled by weakening of the O-H bonds of alcohols and water coordinated to SmI2. Although the current reaction is not suitable for use on an industrial scale, this work demonstrates an opportunity for further research into catalytic nitrogen fixation."], ["Transferrin receptor 1 is a cellular receptor for New World haemorrhagic fever arenaviruses", "At least five arenaviruses cause viral haemorrhagic fevers in humans. Lassa virus, an Old World arenavirus, uses the cellular receptor alpha-dystroglycan to infect cells(1). Machupo, Guanarito, Junin and Sabia viruses are New World haemorrhagic fever viruses that do not use alpha-dystroglycan(2). Here we show a specific, high-affinity association between transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and the entry glycoprotein ( GP) of Machupo virus. Expression of human TfR1, but not human transferrin receptor 2, in hamster cell lines markedly enhanced the infection of viruses pseudotyped with the GP of Machupo, Guanarito and Junin viruses, but not with those of Lassa or lymphocytic choriomeningitis viruses. An anti-TfR1 antibody efficiently inhibited the replication of Machupo, Guanarito, Junin and Sabia viruses, but not that of Lassa virus. Iron depletion of culture medium enhanced, and iron supplementation decreased, the efficiency of infection by Junin and Machupo but not Lassa pseudoviruses. These data indicate that TfR1 is a cellular receptor for New World haemorrhagic fever arenaviruses."], ["Effective breast cancer combination therapy targeting BACH1 and mitochondrial metabolism", "Mitochondrial metabolism is an attractive target for cancer therapy(1,2). Reprogramming metabolic pathways could improve the ability of metabolic inhibitors to suppress cancers with limited treatment options, such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)(1,3). Here we show that BTB and CNC homology1 (BACH1)(4), a haem-binding transcription factor that is increased in expression in tumours from patients with TNBC, targets mitochondrial metabolism. BACH1 decreases glucose utilization in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and negatively regulates transcription of electron transport chain (ETC) genes. BACH1 depletion by shRNA or degradation by hemin sensitizes cells to ETC inhibitors such as metformin(5,6), suppressing growth of both cell line and patient-derived tumour xenografts. Expression of a haem-resistant BACH1 mutant in cells that express a short hairpin RNA for BACH1 rescues the BACH1 phenotype and restores metformin resistance in hemin-treated cells and tumours(7). Finally, BACH1 gene expression inversely correlates with ETC gene expression in tumours from patients with breast cancer and in other tumour types, which highlights the clinical relevance of our findings. This study demonstrates that mitochondrial metabolism can be exploited by targeting BACH1 to sensitize breast cancer and potentially other tumour tissues to mitochondrial inhibitors."], ["Broad neutralization coverage of HIV by multiple highly potent antibodies", "Broadly neutralizing antibodies against highly variable viral pathogens are much sought after to treat or protect against global circulating viruses. Here we probed the neutralizing antibody repertoires of four human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected donors with remarkably broad and potent neutralizing responses and rescued 17 new monoclonal antibodies that neutralize broadly across clades. Many of the new monoclonal antibodies are almost tenfold more potent than the recently described PG9, PG16 and VRC01 broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and 100-fold more potent than the original prototype HIV broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies(1-3). The monoclonal antibodies largely recapitulate the neutralization breadth found in the corresponding donor serum and many recognize novel epitopes on envelope (Env) glycoprotein gp120, illuminating new targets for vaccine design. Analysis of neutralization by the full complement of anti-HIV broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies now available reveals that certain combinations of antibodies should offer markedly more favourable coverage of the enormous diversity of global circulating viruses than others and these combinations might be sought in active or passive immunization regimes. Overall, the isolation of multiple HIV broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from several donors that, in aggregate, provide broad coverage at low concentrations is a highly positive indicator for the eventual design of an effective antibody-based HIV vaccine."], ["Origin of structural degradation in Li-rich layered oxide cathode", "Li- and Mn-rich (LMR) cathode materials that utilize both cation and anion redox can yield substantial increases in battery energy density(1-3). However, although voltage decay issues cause continuous energy loss and impede commercialization, the prerequisite driving force for this phenomenon remains a mystery(3-6) Here, with in situ nanoscale sensitive coherent X-ray diffraction imaging techniques, we reveal that nanostrain and lattice displacement accumulate continuously during operation of the cell. Evidence shows that this effect is the driving force for both structure degradation and oxygen loss, which trigger the well-known rapid voltage decay in LMR cathodes. By carrying out micro- to macro-length characterizations that span atomic structure, the primary particle, multiparticle and electrode levels, we demonstrate that the heterogeneous nature of LMR cathodes inevitably causes pernicious phase displacement/strain, which cannot be eliminated by conventional doping or coating methods. We therefore propose mesostructural design as a strategy to mitigate lattice displacement and inhomogeneous electrochemical/structural evolutions, thereby achieving stable voltage and capacity profiles. These findings highlight the significance of lattice strain/displacement in causing voltage decay and will inspire a wave of efforts to unlock the potential of the broad-scale commercialization of LMR cathode materials."], ["The X-ray counterpart to the gravitational-wave event GW170817", "A long-standing paradigm in astrophysics is that collisionsor mergers-of two neutron stars form highly relativistic and collimated outflows (jets) that power gamma-ray bursts of short (less than two seconds) duration(1-3). The observational support for this model, however, is only indirect(4,5). A hitherto outstanding prediction is that gravitational-wave events from such mergers should be associated with gamma-ray bursts, and that a majority of these bursts should be seen off-axis, that is, they should point away from Earth(6,7). Here we report the discovery observations of the X-ray counterpart associated with the gravitational-wave event GW170817. Although the electromagnetic counterpart at optical and infrared frequencies is dominated by the radioactive glow (known as a 'kilonova') from freshly synthesized rapid neutron capture (r-process) material in the merger ejecta(8-10), observations at X-ray and, later, radio frequencies are consistent with a short gamma-ray burst viewed off-axis(7,11). Our detection of X-ray emission at a location coincident with the kilonova transient provides the missing observational link between short gamma-ray bursts and gravitational waves from neutron-star mergers, and gives independent confirmation of the collimated nature of the gamma-ray-burst emission."], ["A large source of cloud condensation nuclei from new particle formation in the tropics", "Cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) can affect cloud properties and therefore Earth's radiative balance(1-3). New particle formation (NPF) from condensable vapours in the free troposphere has been suggested to contribute to CCN, especially in remote, pristine atmospheric regions(4), but direct evidence is sparse, and the magnitude of this contribution is uncertain(5-7). Here we use in situ aircraft measurements of vertical profiles of aerosol size distributions to present a global-scale survey of NPF occurrence. We observe intense NPF at high altitudes in tropical convective regions over both Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Together with the results of chemical-transport models, our findings indicate that NPF persists at all longitudes as a global-scale band in the tropical upper troposphere, covering about 40 per cent of Earth's surface. Furthermore, we find that this NPF in the tropical upper troposphere is a globally important source of CCN in the lower troposphere, where CCN can affect cloud properties. Our findings suggest that the production of CCN as new particles descend towards the surface is not adequately captured in global models, which tend to underestimate both the magnitude of tropical upper tropospheric NPF and the subsequent growth of new particles to CCN sizes."], ["Evidence for unconventional superconductivity in twisted trilayer graphene", "Magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATTG) has emerged as a moire material that exhibits strong electronic correlations and unconventional superconductivity(1,2). However, local spectroscopic studies of this system are still lacking. Here we perform high-resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy of MATTG that reveal extensive regions of atomic reconstruction favouring mirror-symmetric stacking. In these regions, we observe symmetry-breaking electronic transitions and doping-dependent band-structure deformations similar to those in magic-angle bilayers, as expected theoretically given the commonality of flat bands(3,4). Most notably in a density window spanning two to three holes per moire unit cell, the spectroscopic signatures of superconductivity are manifest as pronounced dips in the tunnelling conductance at the Fermi level accompanied by coherence peaks that become gradually suppressed at elevated temperatures and magnetic fields. The observed evolution of the conductance with doping is consistent with a gate-tunable transition from a gapped superconductor to a nodal superconductor, which is theoretically compatible with a sharp transition from a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superconductor to a Bose-Einstein-condensation superconductor with a nodal order parameter. Within this doping window, we also detect peak-dip-hump structures that suggest that superconductivity is driven by strong coupling to bosonic modes of MATTG. Our results will enable further understanding of superconductivity and correlated states in graphene-based moire structures beyond twisted bilayers(5)."], ["Highly efficient phosphorescent emission from organic electroluminescent devices", "The efficiency of electroluminescent organic light-emitting devices(1,2) can be improved by the introduction(3) of a fluorescent dye. Energy transfer from the host to the dye occurs via excitons, but only the singlet spin states induce fluorescent emission; these represent a small fraction (about 25%) of the total excited-state population (the remainder are triplet states). Phosphorescent dyes, however, offer a means of achieving improved light-emission efficiencies, as emission may result from both singlet and triplet states. Here we report high-efficiency (greater than or similar to 90%) energy transfer from both singlet and triplet states, in a host material doped with the phosphorescent dye 2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18-octaethyl-21H,23H-porphine platinum(II) (PtOEP). Our doped electroluminescent devices generate saturated red emission with peak external and internal quantum efficiencies of 4% and 23%, respectively. The luminescent efficiencies attainable with phosphorescent dyes may lead to new applications for organic materials. Moreover, our work establishes the utility of PtOEP as a probe of triplet behaviour and energy transfer in organic solid-state systems."], ["Gram-scale bottom-up flash graphene synthesis", "Most bulk-scale graphene is produced by a top-down approach, exfoliating graphite, which often requires large amounts of solvent with high-energy mixing, shearing, sonication or electrochemical treatment(1-3). Although chemical oxidation of graphite to graphene oxide promotes exfoliation, it requires harsh oxidants and leaves the graphene with a defective perforated structure after the subsequent reduction step(3,4). Bottom-up synthesis of high-quality graphene is often restricted to ultrasmall amounts if performed by chemical vapour deposition or advanced synthetic organic methods, or it provides a defect-ridden structure if carried out in bulk solution(4-6). Here we show that flash Joule heating of inexpensive carbon sources-such as coal, petroleum coke, biochar, carbon black, discarded food, rubber tyres and mixed plastic waste-can afford gram-scale quantities of graphene in less than one second. The product, named flash graphene (FG) after the process used to produce it, shows turbostratic arrangement (that is, little order) between the stacked graphene layers. FG synthesis uses no furnace and no solvents or reactive gases. Yields depend on the carbon content of the source; when using a high-carbon source, such as carbon black, anthracitic coal or calcined coke, yields can range from 80 to 90 per cent with carbon purity greater than 99 per cent. No purification steps are necessary. Raman spectroscopy analysis shows a low-intensity or absent D band for FG, indicating that FG has among the lowest defect concentrations reported so far for graphene, and confirms the turbostratic stacking of FG, which is clearly distinguished from turbostratic graphite. The disordered orientation of FG layers facilitates its rapid exfoliation upon mixing during composite formation. The electric energy cost for FG synthesis is only about 7.2 kilojoules per gram, which could render FG suitable for use in bulk composites of plastic, metals, plywood, concrete and other building materials. Flash Joule heating of inexpensive carbon sources is used to produce gram-scale quantities of high-quality graphene in under a second, without the need for a furnace, solvents or reactive gases."], ["Enzyme-catalysed [6+4] cycloadditions in the biosynthesis of natural products", "Pericyclic reactions are powerful transformations for the construction of carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds in organic synthesis. Their role in biosynthesis is increasingly apparent, and mechanisms by which pericyclases can catalyse reactions are of major interest(1). [4+2] cycloadditions (Diels-Alder reactions) have been widely used in organic synthesis2 for the formation of six-membered rings and are now well-established in biosynthesis(3-6). [6+4] and other 'higher-order' cycloadditions were predicted(7) in 1965, and are now increasingly common in the laboratory despite challenges arising from the generation of a highly strained ten-membered ring system(8,9). However, although enzyme-catalysed [6+4] cycloadditions have been proposed(10-12), they have not been proven to occur. Here we demonstrate a group of enzymes that catalyse a pericyclic [6+4] cycloaddition, which is a crucial step in the biosynthesis of streptoseomycin-type natural products. This type of pericyclase catalyses [6+4] and [4+2] cycloadditions through a single ambimodal transition state, which is consistent with previous proposals(11,12). The [6+4] product is transformed to a less stable [4+2] adduct via a facile Cope rearrangement, and the [4+2] adduct is converted into the natural product enzymatically. Crystal structures of three pericyclases, computational simulations of potential energies and molecular dynamics, and site-directed mutagenesis establish the mechanism of this transformation. This work shows how enzymes are able to catalyse concerted pericyclic reactions involving ambimodal transition states."], ["Experimental demonstration of memory-enhanced quantum communication", "The ability to communicate quantum information over long distances is of central importance in quantum science and engineering(1). Although some applications of quantum communication such as secure quantum key distribution(2,3) are already being successfully deployed(4-7), their range is currently limited by photon losses and cannot be extended using straightforward measure-and-repeat strategies without compromising unconditional security(8). Alternatively, quantum repeaters(9), which utilize intermediate quantum memory nodes and error correction techniques, can extend the range of quantum channels. However, their implementation remains an outstanding challenge(10-16), requiring a combination of efficient and high-fidelity quantum memories, gate operations, and measurements. Here we use a single solid-state spin memory integrated in a nanophotonic diamond resonator(17-19) to implement asynchronous photonic Bell-state measurements, which are a key component of quantum repeaters. In a proof-of-principle experiment, we demonstrate high-fidelity operation that effectively enables quantum communication at a rate that surpasses the ideal loss-equivalent direct-transmission method while operating at megahertz clock speeds. These results represent a crucial step towards practical quantum repeaters and large-scale quantum networks(20,21).

These micropore dimensions are relevant for many valuable chemical intermediates, and therefore MFI-type zeolites are widely used in the chemical industry as selective catalysts or adsorbents(3-5). As with all zeolites, strategies to tailor them for specific applications include controlling their crystal size and shape(5-8). Nanometre-thick MFI crystals (nanosheets) have been introduced in pillared(9) and self-pillared (intergrown)(10) architectures, offering improved mass-transfer characteristics for certain adsorption and catalysis applications(11-14). Moreover, single (non-intergrown and nonlayered) nanosheets have been used to prepare thin membranes(15,16) that could be used to improve the energy efficiency of separation processes(17). However, until now, single MFI nanosheets have been prepared using a multi-step approach based on the exfoliation of layered MFI9,15, followed by centrifugation to remove non-exfoliated particles(18). This top-down method is time-consuming, costly and low-yield and it produces fragmented nanosheets with submicrometre lateral dimensions. Alternatively, direct (bottom-up) synthesis could produce high-aspect-ratio zeolite nanosheets, with improved yield and at lower cost. Here we use a nanocrystal-seeded growth method triggered by a single rotational intergrowth to synthesize high-aspect-ratio MFI nanosheets with a thickness of 5 nanometres (2.5 unit cells). These high-aspect-ratio nanosheets allow the fabrication of thin and defect-free coatings that effectively cover porous substrates. These coatings can be intergrown to produce high-flux and ultra-selective MFI membranes that compare favourably with other MFI membranes prepared from existing MFI materials (such as exfoliated nanosheets or nanocrystals)."], ["The Chemistry of CO: Carbonylation", "Carbon monoxide is one of the most important C1 molecules in organic chemistry.

Some features have been identified as the stretching and bending modes of aromatic compounds(2,3), and are commonly attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules(4,5). The central argument supporting this attribution is that single-photon excitation of the molecule can account for the unidentified infrared emission features observed in 'cirrus' clouds in the diffuse interstellar medium(6). Of the more than 160 molecules identified in the circumstellar and interstellar environments, however, not one is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecule. The detections of discrete and broad aliphatic spectral features suggest that the carrier of the unidentified infrared emission features cannot be a pure aromatic compound. Here we report an analysis of archival spectroscopic observations and demonstrate that the data are most consistent with the carriers being amorphous organic solids with a mixed aromatic-aliphatic structure. This structure is similar to that of the organic materials found in meteorites, as would be expected if the Solar System had inherited these organic materials from interstellar sources."], ["Transition Metal (Ni, Cu, Pd)-Catalyzed Alkene Dicarbofunctionalization Reactions", "Recently, alkene dicarbofunctionalization, i.e., the powerful organic synthesis method of alkene difunctionalization with two carbon sources, emerged as a formidable reaction with immense promise to synthesize complex molecules expeditiously from simple chemicals. This reaction is generally achieved with transition metals (TMs) through interception by carbon sources of an alkylmetal [\u03b2-H\u2013C(sp3)\u2013[M]] species, a key intermediate prone to undergo rapid \u03b2-H elimination. Related prior reports, since Paolo Chiusoli and Catellani\u2019s work in 1982 [ Tetrahedron Lett. 1982, 23, 4517], have used bicyclic and disubstituted terminal alkenes, wherein \u03b2-H elimination is avoided by geometric restriction or complete lack of \u03b2-H\u2019s. With reasoning that \u03b2-H\u2013C(sp3)\u2013[M] intermediates could be rendered amenable to interception with the use of first row late TMs and formation of coordination-assisted transient metallacycles, these two strategies were implemented to address the \u03b2-H elimination problem in alkene dicarbofunctionalization reactions.\nBecause first row late TMs catalyze C(sp3)\u2013C(sp3) coupling, Cu and Ni were anticipated to impart sufficient stability to \u03b2-H\u2013C(sp3)\u2013[M] intermediates, generated catalytically upon alkene carbometalation, for their subsequent interception by carbon electrophiles/nucleophiles in three-component reactions. Additionally, such an innate property could enable alkene difunctionalization with carbon coupling partners through entropically driven cyclization/coupling reactions. The cyclometalation concept to stabilize intractable \u03b2-H\u2013C(sp3)\u2013[M] intermediates was hypothesized when three-component reactions were performed. The idea of cyclometalation to curtail \u03b2-H elimination is founded upon Whitesides\u2019s [ J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1976, 98, 6521] observation that metallacycles undergo \u03b2-H elimination much slower than acyclic alkylmetals.\nIn this Account, examples of alkene dicarbofunctionalization reactions demonstrate that Cu and Ni catalysts could enable cyclization/coupling of alkenylzinc reagents, alkyl halides, and aryl halides to afford complex carbo- and heterocycles. In addition, forming coordination-assisted transient nickellacycles enabled regioselective performance of three-component dicarbofunctionalization of various alkenyl compounds. In situ reaction of [M]-H with alkenes generated after \u03b2-H elimination induced an unprecedented metallacycle contraction process, in which six-membered metal-containing rings shrank to five-membered cycles, allowing creation of new carbon\u2013carbon bonds at allylic (1,3) positions. Applications of these regioselective alkene dicarbofunctionalization reactions are discussed."], ["A universal interface for plug-and-play assembly of stretchable devices", "Stretchable hybrid devices have enabled high-fidelity implantable(1-3) and on-skin(4-6) monitoring of physiological signals. These devices typically contain soft modules that match the mechanical requirements in humans(7,8) and soft robots(9,10), rigid modules containing Si-based microelectronics(11,12) and protective encapsulation modules(13,14). To make such a system mechanically compliant, the interconnects between the modules need to tolerate stress concentration that may limit their stretching and ultimately cause debonding failure(15-17). Here, we report a universal interface that can reliably connect soft, rigid and encapsulation modules together to form robust and highly stretchable devices in a plug-and-play manner. The interface, consisting of interpenetrating polymer and metal nanostructures, connects modules by simply pressing without using pastes. Its formation is depicted by a biphasic network growth model. Soft-soft modules joined by this interface achieved 600% and 180% mechanical and electrical stretchability, respectively. Soft and rigid modules can also be electrically connected using the above interface. Encapsulation on soft modules with this interface is strongly adhesive with an interfacial toughness of 0.24 N mm(-1). As a proof of concept, we use this interface to assemble stretchable devices for in vivo neuromodulation and on-skin electromyography, with high signal quality and mechanical resistance. We expect such a plug-and-play interface to simplify and accelerate the development of on-skin and implantable stretchable devices."], ["Enzymes for chemical synthesis", "New catalytic synthetic methods in organic chemistry that satisfy increasingly stringent environmental constraints are in great demand by the pharmaceutical and chemical industries.

A system of DNA repair, called the DNA damage response, detects and repairs damaged DNA and prevents cell division until the repair is complete. Here we report that methylation at the 6 position of adenosine (m(6)A) in RNA is rapidly (within 2 min) and transiently induced at DNA damage sites in response to ultraviolet irradiation. This modification occurs on numerous poly(A)+ transcripts and is regulated by the methyltransferase METTL3 (methyltransferase-like 3) 1 and the demethylase FTO (fat mass and obesity-associated protein) 2. In the absence of METTL3 catalytic activity, cells showed delayed repair of ultraviolet-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine adducts and elevated sensitivity to ultraviolet, demonstrating the importance of m(6)A in the ultraviolet-responsive DNA damage response. Multiple DNA polymerases are involved in the ultraviolet response, some of which resynthesize DNA after the lesion has been excised by the nucleotide excision repair pathway3, while others participate in trans-lesion synthesis to allow replication past damaged lesions in S phase(4). DNA polymerase. (Pol.), which has been implicated in both nucleotide excision repair and trans-lesion synthesis(5,6), required the catalytic activity of METTL3 for immediate localization to ultravioletinduced DNA damage sites. Importantly, Pol. overexpression qualitatively suppressed the cyclobutane pyrimidine removal defect associated with METTL3 loss. Thus, we have uncovered a novel function for RNA m(6)A modification in the ultraviolet-induced DNA damage response, and our findings collectively support a model in which m(6)A RNA serves as a beacon for the selective, rapid recruitment of Pol. to damage sites to facilitate repair and cell survival."], ["Regioselective and Stereospecific Deuteration of Bioactive AzaCompounds by the Use of Ruthenium Nanoparticles", "An efficient H/D exchange method allowing the deuteration of pyridines, quinolines, indoles, and alkyl amines with D2 in the presence of Ru@PVP nanoparticles is described. By a general and simple procedure involving mild reaction conditions and simple filtration to recover the labeled product, the isotopic labeling of 22 compounds proceeded in good yield with high chemo- and regioselectivity. The viability of this procedure was demonstrated by the labeling of eight biologically active compounds. Remarkably, enantiomeric purity was conserved in the labeled compounds, even though labeling took place in the vicinity of the stereogenic center. The level of isotopic enrichment observed is suitable for metabolomic studies in most cases. This approach is also perfectly adapted to tritium labeling because it uses a gas as an isotopic source. Besides these applications to molecules of biological interest, this study reveals a rich and underestimated chemistry on the surface of ruthenium nanoparticles."], ["Inhibitors of histone acetyltransferases KAT6A/B induce senescence and arrest tumour growth", "Acetylation of histones by lysine acetyltransferases (KATs) is essential for chromatin organization and function(1). Among the genes coding for the MYST family of KATs (KAT5-KAT8) are the oncogenes KAT6A (also known as MOZ) and KAT6B (also known as MORF and QKF)(2,3). KAT6A has essential roles in normal haematopoietic stem cells(4-6) and is the target of recurrent chromosomal translocations, causing acute myeloid leukaemia(7,8). Similarly, chromosomal translocations in KAT6B have been identified in diverse cancers(8). KAT6A suppresses cellular senescence through the regulation of suppressors of the CDKN2A locus(9,10), a function that requires its KAT activity(10). Loss of one allele of KAT6A extends the median survival of mice with MYC-induced lymphoma from 105 to 413 days(11). These findings suggest that inhibition of KAT6A and KAT6B may provide a therapeutic benefit in cancer. Here we present highly potent, selective inhibitors of KAT6A and KAT6B, denoted WM-8014 and WM-1119. Biochemical and structural studies demonstrate that these compounds are reversible competitors of acetyl coenzyme A and inhibit MYST-catalysed histone acetylation. WM-8014 and WM-1119 induce cell cycle exit and cellular senescence without causing DNA damage. Senescence is INK4A/ARF-dependent and is accompanied by changes in gene expression that are typical of loss of KAT6A function. WM-8014 potentiates oncogene-induced senescence in vitro and in a zebrafish model of hepatocellular carcinoma. WM-1119, which has increased bioavailability, arrests the progression of lymphoma in mice. We anticipate that this class of inhibitors will help to accelerate the development of therapeutics that target gene transcription regulated by histone acetylation."], ["Crystal structure of a small heat-shock protein", "The principal heat-shock proteins that have chaperone activity (that is, they protect newly made proteins from misfolding) belong to five conserved classes: HSP100, HSP90, HSP70, HSP60 and the small heat-shock proteins (sHSPs). The sHSPs can form large multimeric structures and have a wide range of cellular functions, including endowing cells with thermotolerance in vivo(1,2) and being able to act as molecular chaperones in vitro(3-8); sHSPs do this by forming stable complexes with folding intermediates of their protein substrates(9,10). However, there is little information available about these structures or the mechanism by which substrates are protected from thermal denaturation by sHSPs. Here we report the crystal structure of a small heat-shock protein from Methanococcus jannaschii, a hyperthermophilic archaeon. The monomeric folding unit is a composite beta-sandwich in which one of the beta-strands comes from a neighbouring molecule. Twenty-four monomers form a hollow spherical complex of octahedral symmetry, with eight trigonal and six square 'windows'.

Biogenic volatile organic compounds such as terpenoids emitted from plants are important secondary organic aerosol precursors with isoprene dominating the emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds globally. However, the particle mass from isoprene oxidation is generally modest compared to that of other terpenoids. Here we show that isoprene, carbon monoxide and methane can each suppress the instantaneous mass and the overall mass yield derived from monoterpenes in mixtures of atmospheric vapours. We find that isoprene 'scavenges' hydroxyl radicals, preventing their reaction with monoterpenes, and the resulting isoprene peroxy radicals scavenge highly oxygenated monoterpene products. These effects reduce the yield of low-volatility products that would otherwise form secondary organic aerosol. Global model calculations indicate that oxidant and product scavenging can operate effectively in the real atmosphere. Thus highly reactive compounds (such as isoprene) that produce a modest amount of aerosol are not necessarily net producers of secondary organic particle mass and their oxidation in mixtures of atmospheric vapours can suppress both particle number and mass of secondary organic aerosol. We suggest that formation mechanisms of secondary organic aerosol in the atmosphere need to be considered more realistically, accounting for mechanistic interactions between the products of oxidizing precursor molecules (as is recognized to be necessary when modelling ozone production)."], ["Topological superconductivity in a phase-controlled Josephson junction", "Topological superconductors can support localized Majorana states at their boundaries(1-5). These quasi-particle excitations obey non-Abelian statistics that can be used to encode and manipulate quantum information in a topologically protected manner(6,7). Although signatures of Majorana bound states have been observed in one-dimensional systems, there is an ongoing effort to find alternative platforms that do not require fine-tuning of parameters and can be easily scaled to large numbers of states(8-21). Here we present an experimental approach towards a two-dimensional architecture of Majorana bound states. Using a Josephson junction made of a HgTe quantum well coupled to thin-film aluminium, we are able to tune the transition between a trivial and a topological superconducting state by controlling the phase difference across the junction and applying an in-plane magnetic field(22). We determine the topological state of the resulting superconductor by measuring the tunnelling conductance at the edge of the junction. At low magnetic fields, we observe a minimum in the tunnelling spectra near zero bias, consistent with a trivial superconductor. However, as the magnetic field increases, the tunnelling conductance develops a zero-bias peak, which persists over a range of phase differences that expands systematically with increasing magnetic field. Our observations are consistent with theoretical predictions for this system and with full quantum mechanical numerical simulations performed on model systems with similar dimensions and parameters. Our work establishes this system as a promising platform for realizing topological superconductivity and for creating and manipulating Majorana modes and probing topological superconducting phases in two-dimensional systems."], ["Large emissions from floodplain trees close the Amazon methane budget", "Wetlands are the largest global source of atmospheric methane (CH4)(1), a potent greenhouse gas. However, methane emission inventories from the Amazon floodplain(2,3), the largest natural geographic source of CH4 in the tropics, consistently underestimate the atmospheric burden of CH4 determined via remote sensing and inversion modelling(4,5), pointing to a major gap in our understanding of the contribution of these ecosystems to CH4 emissions. Here we report CH4 fluxes from the stems of 2,357 individual Amazonian floodplain trees from 13 locations across the central Amazon basin. We find that escape of soil gas through wetland trees is the dominant source of regional CH4 emissions. Methane fluxes from Amazon tree stems were up to 200 times larger than emissions reported for temperate wet forests(6) and tropical peat swamp forests(7), representing the largest non-ebullitive wetland fluxes observed. Emissions from trees had an average stable carbon isotope value (delta C-13) of -66.2 +/- 6.4 per mil, consistent with a soil biogenic origin. We estimate that floodplain trees emit 15.1 +/- 1.8 to 21.2 +/- 2.5 teragrams of CH4 a year, in addition to the 20.5 +/- 5.3 teragrams a year emitted regionally from other sources. Furthermore, we provide a 'topdown' regional estimate of CH4 emissions of 42.7 +/- 5.6 teragrams of CH4 a year for the Amazon basin, based on regular vertical lower-troposphere CH4 profiles covering the period 2010-2013. We find close agreement between our 'top-down' and combined 'bottom-up' estimates, indicating that large CH4 emissions from trees adapted to permanent or seasonal inundation can account for the emission source that is required to close the Amazon CH4 budget. Our findings demonstrate the importance of tree stem surfaces in mediating approximately half of all wetland CH4 emissions in the Amazon floodplain, a region that represents up to one-third of the global wetland CH4 source when trees are combined with other emission sources."], ["DWARF14 is a non-canonical hormone receptor for strigolactone", "Classical hormone receptors reversibly and non-covalently bind active hormone molecules, which are generated by biosynthetic enzymes, to trigger signal transduction. The alpha/beta hydrolase DWARF14 (D14), which hydrolyses the plant branching hormone strigolactone and interacts with the F-box protein D3/MAX2, is probably involved in strigolactone detection(1-3). However, the active form of strigolactone has yet to be identified and it is unclear which protein directly binds the active form of strigolactone, and in which manner, to act as the genuine strigolactone receptor. Here we report the crystal structure of the strigolactone-induced AtD14-D3-ASK1 complex, reveal that Arabidopsis thaliana (At) D14 undergoes an open-to-closed state transition to trigger strigolactone signalling, and demonstrate that strigolactone is hydrolysed into a covalently linked intermediate molecule (CLIM) to initiate a conformational change of AtD14 to facilitate interaction with D3. Notably, analyses of a highly branched Arabidopsis mutant d14-5 show that the AtD14(G158E) mutant maintains enzyme activity to hydrolyse strigolactone, but fails to efficiently interact with D3/MAX2 and loses the ability to act as a receptor that triggers strigolactone signalling in planta. These findings uncover a mechanism underlying the allosteric activation of AtD14 by strigolactone hydrolysis into CLIM, and define AtD14 as a non-canonical hormone receptor with dual functions to generate and sense the active form of strigolactone."], ["The road to fully programmable protein catalysis", "The ability to design efficient enzymes from scratch would have a profound effect on chemistry, biotechnology and medicine. Rapid progress in protein engineering over the past decade makes us optimistic that this ambition is within reach. The development of artificial enzymes containing metal cofactors and noncanonical organocatalytic groups shows how protein structure can be optimized to harness the reactivity of nonproteinogenic elements. In parallel, computational methods have been used to design protein catalysts for diverse reactions on the basis of fundamental principles of transition state stabilization. Although the activities of designed catalysts have been quite low, extensive laboratory evolution has been used to generate efficient enzymes. Structural analysis of these systems has revealed the high degree of precision that will be needed to design catalysts with greater activity. To this end, emerging protein design methods, including deep learning, hold particular promise for improving model accuracy.

To maintain performance, the filter units must inevitably be replaced at some point, which requires maintenance, involves costs and generates solid waste(6,7). Here we show that an ion-doped conjugated polymer-coated matrix infiltrated with a selected functional liquid enables efficient, continuous and maintenance-free air purification. As the air to be purified moves through the system in the form of bubbles, the functional fluid provides interfaces for filtration and for removal of particulate matter and pollutant molecules from air. Theoretical modelling and experimental results demonstrate that the system exhibits high efficiency and robustness: its one-time air purification efficiency can reach 99.6%, and its dust-holding capacity can reach 950 g m(-2). The system is durable and resistant to fouling and corrosion, and the liquid acting as filter can be reused and adjusted to also enable removal of bacteria or odours.

Here we show how the K+ channel displaces water molecules around an ion at its extracellular entryway, and how it holds a K+ ion in a square antiprism of water molecules in a cavity near its intracellular entryway. Carbonyl oxygen atoms within the selectivity filter form a very similar square antiprism around each K+ binding site, as if to mimic the waters of hydration. The selectivity filter changes its ion coordination structure in low K+ solutions. This structural change is crucial to the operation of the selectivity filter in the cellular context, where the K+ ion concentration near the selectivity filter varies in response to channel gating."], ["Reversible Mn<SUP>2+</SUP>/Mn<SUP>4+</SUP> double redox in lithium-excess cathode materials", "There is an urgent need for low-cost, resource-friendly, high-energy-density cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries to satisfy the rapidly increasing need for electrical energy storage. To replace the nickel and cobalt, which are limited resources and are associated with safety problems, in current lithium-ion batteries, high-capacity cathodes based on manganese would be particularly desirable owing to the low cost and high abundance of the metal, and the intrinsic stability of the Mn4+ oxidation state. Here we present a strategy of combining high-valent cations and the partial substitution of fluorine for oxygen in a disordered-rocksalt structure to incorporate the reversible Mn2+/Mn4+ double redox couple into lithium-excess cathode materials. The lithium-rich cathodes thus produced have high capacity and energy density.

With the rapid depletion of the limited petroleum reserves that serve as the source of these hydrocarbons, there is an urgent need for processes that can produce lower olefins from alternative feedstocks(3-9). The 'Fischer-Tropsch to olefins' (FTO) process has long offered a way of producing lower olefins directly from syngas-a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide that is readily derived from coal, biomass and natural gas(3-7). But the hydrocarbons obtained with the FTO process typically follow the so-called Anderson-Schulz-Flory distribution, which is characterized by a maximum C-2-C-4 hydrocarbon fraction of about 56.7 per cent and an undesired methane fraction of about 29.2 per cent (refs 1, 10-12). Here we show that, under mild reaction conditions, cobalt carbide quadrangular nanoprisms catalyse the FTO conversion of syngas with high selectivity for the production of lower olefins (constituting around 60.8 per cent of the carbon products), while generating little methane (about 5.0 per cent), with the ratio of desired unsaturated hydrocarbons to less valuable saturated hydrocarbons amongst the C-2-C-4 products being as high as 30. Detailed catalyst characterization during the initial reaction stage and theoretical calculations indicate that preferentially exposed {101} and {020} facets play a pivotal role during syngas conversion, in that they favour olefin production and inhibit methane formation, and thereby render cobalt carbide nanoprisms a promising new catalyst system for directly converting syngas into lower olefins."], ["Lock and key colloids", "New functional materials can in principle be created using colloids that self-assemble into a desired structure by means of a programmable recognition and binding scheme. This idea has been explored by attaching 'programmed' DNA strands to nanometre-(1-3) and micrometre-(4,5) sized particles and then using DNA hybridization to direct the placement of the particles in the final assembly. Here we demonstrate an alternative recognition mechanism for directing the assembly of composite structures, based on particles with complementary shapes. Our system, which uses Fischer's lock-and-key principle(6), employs colloidal spheres as keys and monodisperse colloidal particles with a spherical cavity as locks that bind spontaneously and reversibly via the depletion interaction. The lock-and-key binding is specific because it is controlled by how closely the size of a spherical colloidal key particle matches the radius of the spherical cavity of the lock particle. The strength of the binding can be further tuned by adjusting the solution composition or temperature. The composite assemblies have the unique feature of having flexible bonds, allowing us to produce flexible dimeric, trimeric and tetrameric colloidal molecules as well as more complex colloidal polymers. We expect that this lock-and-key recognition mechanism will find wider use as a means of programming and directing colloidal self-assembly."], ["Pan genome of the phytoplankton <i>Emiliania</i> underpins its global distribution", "Coccolithophores have influenced the global climate for over 200 million years(1). These marine phytoplankton can account for 20 per cent of total carbon fixation in some systems(2). They form blooms that can occupy hundreds of thousands of square kilometres and are distinguished by their elegantly sculpted calcium carbonate exoskeletons (coccoliths), rendering them visible from space(3). Although coccolithophores export carbon in the form of organic matter and calcite to the sea floor, they also release CO2 in the calcification process. Hence, they have a complex influence on the carbon cycle, driving either CO2 production or uptake, sequestration and export to the deep ocean(4). Here we report the first haptophyte reference genome, from the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi strain CCMP1516, and sequences from 13 additional isolates. Our analyses reveal a pan genome (core genes plus genes distributed variably between strains) probably supported by an atypical complement of repetitive sequence in the genome. Comparisons across strains demonstrate that E. huxleyi, which has long been considered a single species, harbours extensive genome variability reflected in different metabolic repertoires. Genome variability within this species complex seems to underpin its capacity both to thrive in habitats ranging from the equator to the subarctic and to form large-scale episodic blooms under a wide variety of environmental conditions."], ["Two types of luminescence blinking revealed by spectroelectrochemistry of single quantum dots", "Photoluminescence blinking-random switching between states of high (ON) and low (OFF) emissivities-is a universal property of molecular emitters found in dyes(1), polymers(2), biological molecules(3) and artificial nanostructures such as nanocrystal quantum dots, carbon nanotubes and nanowires(4-6). For the past 15 years, colloidal nanocrystals have been used as a model system to study this phenomenon(5,6). The occurrence of OFF periods in nanocrystal emission has been commonly attributed to the presence of an additional charge(7), which leads to photoluminescence quenching by non-radiative recombination (the Auger mechanism)(8). However, this 'charging' model was recently challenged in several reports(9,10). Here we report time-resolved photoluminescence studies of individual nanocrystal quantum dots performed while electrochemically controlling the degree of their charging, with the goal of clarifying the role of charging in blinking. We find that two distinct types of blinking are possible: conventional (A-type) blinking due to charging and discharging of the nanocrystal core, in which lower photoluminescence intensities correlate with shorter photoluminescence lifetimes; and a second sort (B-type), in which large changes in the emission intensity are not accompanied by significant changes in emission dynamics. We attribute B-type blinking to charge fluctuations in the electron-accepting surface sites. When unoccupied, these sites intercept 'hot' electrons before they relax into emitting core states. Both blinking mechanisms can be electrochemically controlled and completely suppressed by application of an appropriate potential."], ["Metastable high-entropy dual-phase alloys overcome the strength-ductility trade-off", "Metals have been mankind's most essential materials for thousands of years; however, their use is affected by ecological and economical concerns. Alloys with higher strength and ductility could alleviate some of these concerns by reducing weight and improving energy efficiency. However, most metallurgical mechanisms for increasing strength lead to ductility loss, an effect referred to as the strength-ductility trade-off(1,2). Here we present a metastability-engineering strategy in which we design nanostructured, bulk high-entropy alloys with multiple compositionally equivalent high-entropy phases. High-entropy alloys were originally proposed to benefit from phase stabilization through entropy maximization(3-6). Yet here, motivated by recent work that relaxes the strict restrictions on high-entropy alloy compositions by demonstrating the weakness of this connection(7-11), the concept is overturned. We decrease phase stability to achieve two key benefits: interface hardening due to a dual-phase microstructure (resulting from reduced thermal stability of the high-temperature phase(12)); and transformation-induced hardening (resulting from the reduced mechanical stability of the room-temperature phase(13)). This combines the best of two worlds: extensive hardening due to the decreased phase stability known from advanced steels(14,15) and massive solid-solution strengthening of high-entropy alloys(3). In our transformation-induced plasticity-assisted, dual-phase high-entropy alloy (TRIP-DP-HEA), these two contributions lead respectively to enhanced trans-grain and inter-grain slip resistance, and hence, increased strength. Moreover, the increased strain hardening capacity that is enabled by dislocation hardening of the stable phase and transformation-induced hardening of the metastable phase produces increased ductility. This combined increase in strength and ductility distinguishes the TRIP-DP-HEA alloy from other recently developed structural materials(16,17). This metastability-engineering strategy should thus usefully guide design in the near-infinite compositional space of high-entropy alloys."], ["Carbon-heteroatom bond formation catalysed by organometallic complexes", "At one time the synthetic chemist's last resort, reactions catalysed by transition metals are now the preferred method for synthesizing many types of organic molecule.

The development of these catalytic processes has been supported by the discovery of new elementary reactions that occur at metal - heteroatom bonds and by the identification of factors that control these reactions.

However, the successful realization of critical complementary logic OECTs is currently limited by temporal and/or operational instability, slow redox processes and/or switching, incompatibility with high-density monolithic integration and inferior n-type OECT performance(6-8). Here we demonstrate p- and n-type vertical OECTs with balanced and ultra-high performance by blending redox-active semiconducting polymers with a redox-inactive photocurable and/or photopatternable polymer to form an ion-permeable semiconducting channel, implemented in a simple, scalable vertical architecture that has a dense, impermeable top contact. Footprint current densities exceeding 1 kA cm(-2) at less than +/- 0.7 V, transconductances of 0.2-0.4 S, short transient times of less than 1 ms and ultra-stable switching (> 50,000 cycles) are achieved in, to our knowledge, the first vertically stacked complementary vertical OECT logic circuits.

Although the biological significance of qE is established(4-6), the molecular mechanisms involved are not(7-9). LHCII, the main light-harvesting complex, has an inbuilt capability to undergo transformation into a dissipative state by conformational change(10) and it was suggested that this provides a molecular basis for qE, but it is not known if such events occur in vivo or how energy is dissipated in this state. The transition into the dissipative state is associated with a twist in the configuration of the LHCII-bound carotenoid neoxanthin, identified using resonance Raman spectroscopy(11). Applying this technique to study isolated chloroplasts and whole leaves, we show here that the same change in neoxanthin configuration occurs in vivo, to an extent consistent with the magnitude of energy dissipation. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy(12), performed on purified LHCII in the dissipative state, shows that energy is transferred from chlorophyll a to a low-lying carotenoid excited state, identified as one of the two luteins (lutein 1) in LHCII. Hence, it is experimentally demonstrated that a change in conformation of LHCII occurs in vivo, which opens a channel for energy dissipation by transfer to a bound carotenoid. We suggest that this is the principal mechanism of photoprotection."], ["MATERIALS WITH STRUCTURAL HIERARCHY", "Many natural and man-made materials exhibit structure on more than one length scale; in some materials, the structural elements themselves have structure.

The formation of quasicrystals(7-9) from such a broad range of 'soft' macromolecular micelles suggests that they assemble by a generic mechanism rather than being dependent on the specific chemistry of each system. Indeed, micellar softness has been postulated(7) and shown to lead to quasicrystalline order(10). Here we theoretically explore this link by studying two-dimensional hard disks decorated with step-like square-shoulder repulsion that mimics, for example, the soft alkyl shell around the aromatic core in dendritic micelles(2). We find a family of quasicrystals with 10-, 12-, 18- and 24-fold bond orientational order which originate from mosaics of equilateral and isosceles triangles formed by particles arranged core-to-core and shoulder-to-shoulder. The pair interaction responsible for these phases highlights the role of local packing geometry in generating quasicrystallinity in soft matter, complementing the principles that lead to quasicrystal formation in hard tetrahedra(11,12). Based on simple interparticle potentials, quasicrystalline mosaics may well find use in diverse applications ranging from improved image reproduction(13) to advanced photonic materials(14)."], ["Supercritical fluids as solvents for chemical and materials processing", "Fluids near their critical point have dissolving power comparable to that of liquids, are much more compressible than dilute gases, and have transport properties intermediate between gas- and liquid-like.

DNA sequencing has been extensively and creatively repurposed, including as a 'counter' for a vast range of molecular phenomena. We predict that in the long view of history, the impact of DNA sequencing will be on a par with that of the microscope."], ["Femtosecond X-ray measurement of coherent lattice vibrations near the Lindemann stability limit", "The study of phase-transition dynamics in solids beyond a time-averaged kinetic description requires direct measurement of the changes in the atomic configuration along the physical pathways leading to the new phase. The timescale of interest is in the range 10(-14) to 10(-12) s. Until recently, only optical techniques were capable of providing adequate time resolution(1), albeit with indirect sensitivity to structural arrangement. Ultrafast laser-induced changes of long-range order have recently been directly established for some materials using time-resolved X-ray diffraction(2-8). However, the measurement of the atomic displacements within the unit cell, as well as their relationship with the stability limit of a structural phase(9-11), has to date remained obscure. Here we report time-resolved X-ray diffraction measurements of the coherent atomic displacement of the lattice atoms in photoexcited bismuth close to a phase transition. Excitation of large-amplitude coherent optical phonons gives rise to a periodic modulation of the X-ray diffraction efficiency. Stronger excitation corresponding to atomic displacements exceeding 10 per cent of the nearest-neighbour distance-near the Lindemann limit-leads to a subsequent loss of long-range order, which is most probably due to melting of the material."], ["The formation of cubic ice under conditions relevant to Earth's atmosphere", "An important mechanism for ice cloud formation in the Earth's atmosphere is homogeneous nucleation of ice in aqueous droplets, and this process is generally assumed to produce hexagonal ice(1,2). However, there are some reports that the metastable crystalline phase of ice, cubic ice, may form in the Earth's atmosphere(3-5). Here we present laboratory experiments demonstrating that cubic ice forms when micrometre-sized droplets of pure water and aqueous solutions freeze homogeneously at cooling rates approaching those found in the atmosphere. We find that the formation of cubic ice is dominant when droplets freeze at temperatures below 190 K, which is in the temperature range relevant for polar stratospheric clouds and clouds in the tropical tropopause region. These results, together with heat transfer calculations, suggest that cubic ice will form in the Earth's atmosphere. If there were a significant fraction of cubic ice in some cold clouds this could increase their water vapour pressure, and modify their microphysics and ice particle size distributions(5). Under specific conditions this may lead to enhanced dehydration of the tropopause region(5)."], ["3D Hierarchical Electrodes Boosting Ultrahigh Power Output for Gelatin-KCl-FeCN4\u2212/3\u2212 Ionic Thermoelectric Cells", "Ionic thermoelectric (i-TE) cells, using ions as energy carriers, have theadvantage of achieving a high voltage of 1\u22125 V at approximately ambienttemperature, showing a promise as a technology for powering Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors. However, the low output power of i-TE cells restrictstheir applications. Here, a 3D hierarchical structure electrode is designed toenlarge the electroactive surface area, significantly increasing the thermogal-vanic reaction sites and decreasing the interface charge transfer resistance.The quasi-solid-state gelatin-KCl-FeCN4\u2013/3\u2013 i-TE cells achieve a record instan-taneous output power density (8.9 mW m\u20132 K \u20132 ) and an ultrahigh 2 h outputenergy density (E2h) (80 J m\u20132) under an optimal temperature range.

However, it is not clear why. Here we distinguish among three major competing mechanisms for this phenomenon, by using the 50- year California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations ( CalCOFI) larval fish record. First, variable fishing pressure directly increases variability in exploited populations. Second, commercial fishing can decrease the average body size and age of a stock, causing the truncated population to track environmental fluctuations directly. Third, age- truncated or juvenescent populations have increasingly unstable population dynamics because of changing demographic parameters such as intrinsic growth rates. We find no evidence for the first hypothesis, limited evidence for the second and strong evidence for the third. Therefore, in California Current fisheries, increased temporal variability in the population does not arise from variable exploitation, nor does it reflect direct environmental tracking. More fundamentally, it arises from increased instability in dynamics. This finding has implications for resource management as an empirical example of how selective harvesting can alter the basic dynamics of exploited populations, and lead to unstable booms and busts that can precede systematic declines in stock levels."], ["Surface patterning of nanoparticles with polymer patches", "Patterning of colloidal particles with chemically or topographically distinct surface domains (patches) has attracted intense research interest(1-3). Surface-patterned particles act as colloidal analogues of atoms and molecules(4,5), serve as model systems in studies of phase transitions in liquid systems(6), behave as 'colloidal surfactants'(7) and function as templates for the synthesis of hybrid particles(8). The generation of micrometre- and submicrometre-sized patchy colloids is now efficient(9-11), but surface patterning of inorganic colloidal nanoparticles with dimensions of the order of tens of nanometres is uncommon. Such nanoparticles exhibit size-and shape-dependent optical, electronic and magnetic properties, and their assemblies show new collective properties(12). At present, nanoparticle patterning is limited to the generation of two-patch nanoparticles(13-15), and nanoparticles with surface ripples(16) or a 'raspberry' surface morphology(17). Here we demonstrate nanoparticle surface patterning, which utilizes thermodynamically driven segregation of polymer ligands from a uniform polymer brush into surface-pinned micelles following a change in solvent quality. Patch formation is reversible but can be permanently preserved using a photocrosslinking step. The methodology offers the ability to control the dimensions of patches, their spatial distribution and the number of patches per nanoparticle, in agreement with a theoretical model. The versatility of the strategy is demonstrated by patterning nanoparticles with different dimensions, shapes and compositions, tethered with various types of polymers and subjected to different external stimuli. These patchy nanocolloids have potential applications in fundamental research, the self-assembly of nanomaterials, diagnostics, sensing and colloidal stabilization."], ["In vivo base editing rescues Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome in mice", "Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS or progeria) is typically caused by a dominant-negative C center dot G-to-T center dot A mutation (c.1824 C>T; p.G608G) in LMNA, the gene that encodes nuclear lamin A. This mutation causes RNA mis-splicing that produces progerin, a toxic protein that induces rapid ageing and shortens the lifespan of children with progeria to approximately 14 years1-4. Adenine base editors (ABEs) convert targeted A center dot T base pairs to G center dot C base pairs with minimal by-products and without requiring double-strand DNA breaks or donor DNA templates(5,6) . Here we describe the use of an ABE to directly correct the pathogenic HGPS mutation in cultured fibroblasts derived from children with progeria and in a mouse model of HGPS. Lentiviral delivery of the ABE to fibroblasts from children with HGPS resulted in 87-91% correction of the pathogenic allele, mitigation of RNA mis-splicing, reduced levels of progerin and correction of nuclear abnormalities. Unbiased off-target DNA and RNA editing analysis did not detect off-target editing in treated patient-derived fibroblasts. In transgenic mice that are homozygous for the human LMNA c.1824 C>T allele, a single retro-orbital injection of adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9) encoding the ABE resulted in substantial, durable correction of the pathogenic mutation (around 20-60% across various organs six months after injection), restoration of normal RNA splicing and reduction of progerin protein levels. In vivo base editing rescued the vascular pathology of the mice, preserving vascular smooth muscle cell counts and preventing adventitial fibrosis. A single injection of ABE-expressing AAV9 at postnatal day 14 improved vitality and greatly extended the median lifespan of the mice from 215 to 510 days. These findings demonstrate the potential of in vivo base editing as a possible treatment for HGPS and other genetic diseases by directly correcting their root cause."], ["Membrane proteins bind lipids selectively to modulate their structure and function", "Previous studies have established that the folding, structure and function of membrane proteins are influenced by their lipid environments(1-7) and that lipids can bind to specific sites, for example, in potassium channels(8). Fundamental questions remain however regarding the extent of membrane protein selectivity towards lipids. Here we report a mass spectrometry approach designed to determine the selectivity of lipid binding to membrane protein complexes. We investigate the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) from Myco-bacterium tuberculosis and aquaporin Z (AqpZ) and the ammonia channel (AmtB) from Escherichia coli, using ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS), which reports gas-phase collision cross-sections. We demonstrate that folded conformations of membrane protein complexes can exist in the gas phase. By resolving lipid-bound states, we then rank bound lipids on the basis of their ability to resist gas phase unfolding and thereby stabilize membrane protein structure. Lipids bind non-selectively and with high avidity to MscL, all imparting comparable stability; however, the highest-ranking lipid is phosphatidylinositol phosphate, in line with its proposed functional role in mechanosensation(9). AqpZ is also stabilized by many lipids, with cardiolipin imparting the most significant resistance to unfolding. Subsequently, through functional assays we show that cardiolipin modulates AqpZ function. Similar experiments identify AmtB as being highly selective for phosphatidylglycerol, prompting us to obtain an X-ray structure in this lipid membrane-like environment. The 2.3 angstrom resolution structure, when compared with others obtained without lipid bound, reveals distinct conformational changes that re-position AmtB residues to interact with the lipid bilayer. Our results demonstrate that resistance to unfolding correlates with specific lipid-binding events, enabling a distinction to be made between lipids that merely bind from those that modulate membrane protein structure and/or function. We anticipate that these findings will be important not only for defining the selectivity of membrane proteins towards lipids, but also for understanding the role of lipids in modulating protein function or drug binding."], ["Spin-transfer torque generated by a topological insulator", "Magnetic devices are a leading contender for the implementation of memory and logic technologies that are non-volatile, that can scale to high density and high speed, and that do not wear out. However, widespread application of magnetic memory and logic devices will require the development of efficient mechanisms for reorienting their magnetization using the least possible current and power(1). There has been considerable recent progress in this effort; in particular, it has been discovered that spin-orbit interactions in heavy-metal/ferromagnet bilayers can produce strong current-driven torques on the magnetic layer(2-11), via the spin Hall effect(12,13) in the heavy metal or the Rashba-Edelstein effect(14,15) in the ferromagnet. In the search for materials to provide even more efficient spin-orbit-induced torques, some proposals(16-19) have suggested topological insulators(20,21), which possess a surface state in which the effects of spin-orbit coupling are maximal in the sense that an electron's spin orientation is fixed relative to its propagation direction. Here we report experiments showing that charge current flowing in-plane in a thin film of the topological insulator bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3) at room temperature can indeed exert a strong spin-transfer torque on an adjacent ferromagnetic permalloy (Ni81Fe19) thin film, with a direction consistent with that expected from the topological surface state. We find that the strength of the torque per unit charge current density in Bi2Se3 is greater than for any source of spin-transfer torque measured so far, even for non-ideal topological insulator films in which the surface states coexist with bulk conduction. Our data suggest that topological insulators could enable very efficient electrical manipulation of magnetic materials at room temperature, for memory and logic applications."], ["Activation of TIR signalling boosts pattern-triggered immunity", "Plant immune responses are mainly activated by two types of receptor. Pattern recognition receptors localized on the plasma membrane perceive extracellular microbial features, and nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs) recognize intracellular effector proteins from pathogens(1). NLRs possessing amino-terminal Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains activate defence responses via the NADase activity of the TIR domain(2,3). Here we report that activation of TIR signalling has a key role in pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) mediated by pattern recognition receptors. TIR signalling mutants exhibit attenuated PTI responses and decreased resistance against pathogens. Consistently, PTI is compromised in plants with reduced NLR levels. Treatment with the PTI elicitor flg22 or nlp20 rapidly induces many genes encoding TIR-domain-containing proteins, which is likely to be responsible for activating TIR signalling during PTI. Overall, our study reveals that activation of TIR signalling is an important mechanism for boosting plant defence during PTI."], ["Enhanced strength and ductility in a high-entropy alloy via ordered oxygen complexes", "Oxygen, one of the most abundant elements on Earth, often forms an undesired interstitial impurity or ceramic phase (such as an oxide particle) in metallic materials. Even when it adds strength, oxygen doping renders metals brittle1-3. Here we show that oxygen can take the form of ordered oxygen complexes, a state in between oxide particles and frequently occurring random interstitials. Unlike traditional interstitial strengthening4,5, such ordered interstitial complexes lead to unprecedented enhancement in both strength and ductility in compositionally complex solid solutions, the so-called high-entropy alloys (HEAs) 6-10. The tensile strength is enhanced (by 48.5 +/- 1.8 per cent) and ductility is substantially improved (by 95.2 +/- 8.1 per cent) when doping a model TiZrHfNb HEA with 2.0 atomic per cent oxygen, thus breaking the long-standing strength-ductility trade-off11. The oxygen complexes are ordered nanoscale regions within the HEA characterized by (O, Zr, Ti)-rich atomic complexes whose formation is promoted by the existence of chemical short-range ordering among some of the substitutional matrix elements in the HEAs. Carbon has been reported to improve strength and ductility simultaneously in face-centred cubic HEAs12, by lowering the stacking fault energy and increasing the lattice friction stress. By contrast, the ordered interstitial complexes described here change the dislocation shear mode from planar slip to wavy slip, and promote double cross-slip and thus dislocation multiplication through the formation of Frank-Read sources (a mechanism explaining the generation of multiple dislocations) during deformation. This ordered interstitial complex-mediated strain-hardening mechanism should be particularly useful in Ti-, Zr-and Hf-containing alloys, in which interstitial elements are highly undesirable owing to their embrittlement effects, and in alloys where tuning the stacking fault energy and exploiting athermal transformations13 do not lead to property enhancement. These results provide insight into the role of interstitial solid solutions and associated ordering strengthening mechanisms in metallic materials."], ["Chan\u2013Evans\u2013Lam Couplings with Copper Iminoarylsulfonate Complexes: Scope and Mechanism", "Copper(II) pyridyliminoarylsulfonate complexes with chloride or triflate counteranions were employed in Chan\u2013Evans\u2013Lam (CEL) couplings of N-nucleophiles and arylboronic acids. The complexes avoided typical side reactions in CEL couplings, and an excess of boronic acid was not required. Water was tolerated, and addition of neither base nor other additives was necessary. Primary amines, acyclic and cyclic secondary amines, anilines, aminophenol, imidazole, pyrazole, and phenyltetrazole can be quantitatively arylated at either 25 or 50 \u00b0C with 2.5 mol % of the catalyst. Reaction kinetics were investigated in detail. Kinetic and spectroscopic studies provide evidence for the formation of unproductive copper\u2013substrate complexes. Formation of an aniline\u2013phenylboronic acid adduct was responsible for the zero-order dependence of reaction rates on phenylboronic acid concentration. Kinetic evidence indicates that the order of reaction steps is transmetalation, nucleophile coordination, and oxidation. Couplings performed poorly with electron-deficient arylboronic acids, due to a slower Cu(II)/Cu(III) oxidation in the catalytic cycle. Photoredox catalysis partially resolved this problem, but addition of copper acetate as an external oxidant proved to be more efficient."], ["Structural mechanism for NEK7-licensed activation of NLRP3 inflammasome", "The NLRP3 inflammasome can be activated by stimuli that include nigericin, uric acid crystals, amyloid-beta fibrils and extracellnlar ATP. The mitotic kinase NEK7 licenses the assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in interphase. Here we report a cryo-electron microscopy structure of inactive human NLRP3 in complex with NEK7, at a resolution of 3.8 angstrom. The earring-shaped NLRP3 consists of curved leucine -rich-repeat and globular NACHT domains, and the C-terminal lobe of NEK7 nestles against both NLRP3 domains. Structural recognition between NLRP3 and NEK7 is confirmed by mutagenesis both in vitro and in cells. Modelling of an active NLRP3-NEK7 conformation based on the NLRC4 inflammasome predicts an additional contact between an NLRP3-bound NEK7 and a neighbouring NLRP3. Mutations to this interface abolish the ability of NEK7 or NLRP3 to rescue NLRP3 activation in NEK7-knockout or NLRP3-knockout cells. These data suggest that NEK7 bridges adjacent NLRP3 subunits with bipartite interactions to mediate the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome."], ["Controlling anisotropic nanoparticle growth through plasmon excitation", "Inorganic nanoparticles exhibit size-dependent properties that are of interest for applications ranging from biosensing(1-5) and catalysis(6) to optics(7) and data storage(8). They are readily available in a wide variety of discrete compositions and sizes(9-14). Shape-selective synthesis strategies now also yield shapes other than nanospheres, such as anisotropic metal nanostructures with interesting optical properties(15-23). Here we demonstrate that the previously described photoinduced method(23) for converting silver nanospheres into triangular silver nanocrystals-so-called nanoprisms-can be extended to synthesize relatively mono-disperse nanoprisms with desired edge lengths in the 30-120 nm range. The particle growth process is controlled using dual-beam illumination of the nanoparticles, and appears to be driven by surface plasmon excitations. We find that, depending on the illumination wavelengths chosen, the plasmon excitations lead either to fusion of nanoprisms in an edge-selective manner or to the growth of the nanoprisms until they reach their light-controlled final size."], ["A new method for fast preparation of highly surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) active silver colloids at room temperature by reduction of silver nitrate with hydroxylamine hydrochloride", "A very effective and simple way to produce silver colloids for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is reported. Reduction of silver nitrate with hydroxylamine hydrochloride at alkaline pH and at room temperature yields highly sensitive SERS colloids within a short time. The so-produced colloids can be used for SERS spectroscopy immediately after preparation. The overall procedure is fast, simple, and characterized by a high preparation success rate. Changing the mixing order and rate of the two involved solutions, silver nitrate and hydroxylamine hydrochloride containing sodium hydroxide, one can control the size and dispersion of the produced colloids. The obtained colloids have been characterized by UV\u2212vis spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and SERS using a 1064 nm laser line on a Fourier transform and a 785 nm laser line on a dispersive Raman spectrometer. The SERS enhancement factor of the hydroxylamine-reduced silver colloids was tested using crystal violet, rhodamine 6G, methylene blue, and 9-aminoacridine. It was found that for both excitation lines sensitivities comparable to those achievable with a Lee\u2212Meisel silver colloid were obtained thus rendering the new colloid advantageous because of its significantly simpler and faster synthesis."], ["STRANGE KINETICS", "The once abstract notions of fractal space and time now appear naturally and inevitably in chaotic dynamical systems and lead to 'strange kinetics' and anomalous transport properties.

Molecular triplet excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) are 'dark states' because of the forbidden nature of the direct optical transition between the spin-zero ground state and the spin-one triplet levels(8). Hence, triplet dynamics are conventionally controlled through heavy-metal-based spin-orbit coupling(9-11) or tuning of the singlet-triplet energy splitting(12,13) via molecular design. Both these methods place constraints on the range of properties that can be modified and the molecular structures that can be used. Here we demonstrate that it is possible to control triplet dynamics by coupling organic molecules to lanthanide-doped inorganic insulating nanoparticles. This allows the classically forbidden transitions from the ground-state singlet to excited-state triplets to gain oscillator strength, enabling triplets to be directly generated on molecules via photon absorption. Photogenerated singlet excitons can be converted to triplet excitons on sub-10-picosecond timescales with unity efficiency by intersystem crossing. Triplet exciton states of the molecules can undergo energy transfer to the lanthanide ions with unity efficiency, which allows us to achieve luminescent harvesting of the dark triplet excitons. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the triplet excitons generated in the lanthanide nanoparticle-molecule hybrid systems by near-infrared photoexcitation can undergo efficient upconversion via a lanthanide-triplet excitation fusion process: this process enables endothermic upconversion and allows efficient upconversion from near-infrared to visible frequencies in the solid state. These results provide a new way to control triplet excitons, which is essential for many fields of optoelectronic and biomedical research."], ["In situ surface stress measurement and computational analysis examining the oxygen reduction reaction on Pt and Pd", "Dynamic electrochemical surface stress response during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on Pt and Pd cantilever electrodes in HClO4 and KOH was examined to elucidate surface binding configurations during O2 reduction electrocatalysis. Upon reduction of O2, the surface of Pt exhibits a compressive surface stress response, \u0394Stress, in both acid and base electrolytes due to adsorption of the ORR reactant and intermediates (O2, O, and OH). The magnitude of compressive \u0394Stress on Pt is greater in acid relative to base. On the other hand, the surface of Pd exhibits a negligible \u0394Stress in acid and a slight compressive \u0394Stress in base. Thus, magnitudes of the compressive \u0394Stress (surface expansion) during the ORR follow the order of Pt (acid)\u202f>\u202fPt (base)\u202f>\u202fPd (base)\u202f>\u202fPd (acid)\u202f\u223c\u202f0. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of adsorbate-induced excess surface stress on Pt(111) and Pd(111) surfaces imply a greater compressive surface stress induced on Pt(111) for nearly all adsorbate geometries examined. This trend, which agrees with the experimental observations, can be correlated to a greater tensile intrinsic surface stress of Pt(111) relative to Pd(111) resulting from difference in bond strength and bulk modulus of two metals. On stepped Pt(221) and Pd(221) surfaces, both the intrinsic tensile stress of the clean surface and the adsorbate-induced excess compressive stress are significantly reduced due to the presence of less coordinated, flexible step sites. Moreover, this difference between surface stress at terrace and step sites is more pronounced on Pt, which exhibits a greater intrinsic surface stress."], ["Deep strong light-matter coupling in plasmonic nanoparticle crystals", "Photons and plasmons hybridize into polaritons in three-dimensional crystals of plasmonic nanoparticles, leading to deep strong light-matter coupling and the breakdown of the Purcell effect. In the regime of deep strong light-matter coupling, the coupling strength exceeds the transition energies of the material(1-3), fundamentally changing its properties(4,5); for example, the ground state of the system contains virtual photons and the internal electromagnetic field gets redistributed by photon self-interaction(1,6). So far, no electronic excitation of a material has shown such strong coupling to free-space photons. Here we show that three-dimensional crystals of plasmonic nanoparticles can realize deep strong coupling under ambient conditions, if the particles are ten times larger than the interparticle gaps. The experimental Rabi frequencies (1.9 to 3.3 electronvolts) of face-centred cubic crystals of gold nanoparticles with diameters between 25 and 60 nanometres exceed their plasmon energy by up to 180 per cent. We show that the continuum of photons and plasmons hybridizes into polaritons that violate the rotating-wave approximation. The coupling leads to a breakdown of the Purcell effect-the increase of radiative damping through light-matter coupling-and increases the radiative polariton lifetime. The results indicate that metallic and semiconducting nanoparticles can be used as building blocks for an entire class of materials with extreme light-matter interaction, which will find application in nonlinear optics, the search for cooperative effects and ground states, polariton chemistry and quantum technology(4,5)."], ["Electronic reconstruction at an interface between a Mott insulator and a band insulator", "Surface science is an important and well-established branch of materials science involving the study of changes in material properties near a surface or interface. A fundamental issue has been atomic reconstruction: how the surface lattice symmetry differs from the bulk. 'Correlated-electron compounds' are materials in which strong electron-electron and electron-lattice interactions produce new electronic phases, including interaction-induced (Mott) insulators, many forms of spin, charge and orbital ordering, and (presumably) high-transition-temperature superconductivity(1,2). Here we propose that the fundamental issue for the new field of correlated-electron surface/interface science is 'electronic reconstruction': how does the surface/interface electronic phase differ from that in the bulk? As a step towards a general understanding of such phenomena, we present a theoretical study of an interface between a strongly correlated Mott insulator and a band insulator. We find dramatic interface-induced electronic reconstructions: in wide parameter ranges, the near-interface region is metallic and ferromagnetic, whereas the bulk phase on either side is insulating and anti-ferromagnetic. Extending the analysis to a wider range of interfaces and surfaces is a fundamental scientific challenge and may lead to new applications for correlated electron materials."], ["TDP-43 loss and ALS-risk SNPs drive mis-splicing and depletion of UNC13A", "Risk variants for ALS and FTD in the synaptic gene UNC13A increase the expression of an UNC13A cryptic exon in neurons with TDP-43 depletion. Variants of UNC13A, a critical gene for synapse function, increase the risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia(1-3), two related neurodegenerative diseases defined by mislocalization of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43(4,5). Here we show that TDP-43 depletion induces robust inclusion of a cryptic exon in UNC13A, resulting in nonsense-mediated decay and loss of UNC13A protein. Two common intronic UNC13A polymorphisms strongly associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia risk overlap with TDP-43 binding sites. These polymorphisms potentiate cryptic exon inclusion, both in cultured cells and in brains and spinal cords from patients with these conditions. Our findings, which demonstrate a genetic link between loss of nuclear TDP-43 function and disease, reveal the mechanism by which UNC13A variants exacerbate the effects of decreased TDP-43 function. They further provide a promising therapeutic target for TDP-43 proteinopathies."], ["Adaptive immunity induces mutualism between commensal eukaryotes", "Pathogenic fungi reside in the intestinal microbiota but rarely cause disease. Little is known about the interactions between fungi and the immune system that promote commensalism. Here we investigate the role of adaptive immunity in promoting mutual interactions between fungi and host. We find that potentially pathogenic Candida species induce and are targeted by intestinal immunoglobulin A (IgA) responses. Focused studies on Candida albicans reveal that the pathogenic hyphal morphotype, which is specialized for adhesion and invasion, is preferentially targeted and suppressed by intestinal IgA responses. IgA from mice and humans directly targets hyphal-enriched cell-surface adhesins. Although typically required for pathogenesis, C. albicans hyphae are less fit for gut colonization(1,2) and we show that immune selection against hyphae improves the competitive fitness of C. albicans. C. albicans exacerbates intestinal colitis(3) and we demonstrate that hyphae and an IgA-targeted adhesin exacerbate intestinal damage. Finally, using a clinically relevant vaccine to induce an adhesin-specific immune response protects mice from C. albicans-associated damage during colitis. Together, our findings show that adaptive immunity suppresses harmful fungal effectors, with benefits to both C. albicans and its host. Thus, IgA uniquely uncouples colonization from pathogenesis in commensal fungi to promote homeostasis."], ["A PHD finger of NURF couples histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation with chromatin remodelling", "Lysine methylation of histones is recognized as an important component of an epigenetic indexing system demarcating transcriptionally active and inactive chromatin domains. Trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) marks transcription start sites of virtually all active genes(1-4). Recently, we reported that the WD40-repeat protein WDR5 is important for global levels of H3K4me3 and control of HOX gene expression(5). Here we show that a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger of nucleosome remodelling factor (NURF), an ISWI-containing ATP-dependent chromatin-remodelling complex, mediates a direct preferential association with H3K4me3 tails. Depletion of H3K4me3 causes partial release of the NURF subunit, BPTF (bromodomain and PHD finger transcription factor), from chromatin and defective recruitment of the associated ATPase, SNF2L (also known as ISWI and SMARCA1), to the HOXC8 promoter. Loss of BPTF in Xenopus embryos mimics WDR5 loss-of-function phenotypes, and compromises spatial control of Hox gene expression. These results strongly suggest that WDR5 and NURF function in a common biological pathway in vivo, and that NURF-mediated ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling is directly coupled to H3K4 trimethylation to maintain Hox gene expression patterns during development. We also identify a previously unknown function for the PHD finger as a highly specialized methyl-lysine-binding domain."], ["1H and 19F PGSE diffusion and HOESY NMR studies on cationic palladium (II) 1,3\u2010diphenylallyl complexes in THF solution", "THF solutions of the cationic chiral 1,3-diphenylallyl bidentate phosphine complexes [Pd(\u03b73-PhCHCHCHPh)(Duphos)](CF3SO3), Duphos = 1,2-Bis-((2R,5R)-2,5-dimethylphospholano)benzene), 2, and [Pd(\u03b73-PhCHCHCHPh)(P,S)]BF4, 4, P,S = [8-((o-(diphenylphosphino)benzyl) thiomethyl]\u2014(7,7\u2032-dimethyl)-exo-norborneol, have been studied via pulsed gradient spin-echo (PGSE) diffusion, 1H, 19F HOESY and a variety of other multi-dimensional NMR methods.

All of these hypotheses imply that DOC levels will continue to rise, with unpredictable consequences for the global carbon cycle. Alternatively, it has been proposed that DOC concentrations are returning toward pre-industrial levels as a result of a gradual decline in the sulphate content of atmospheric deposition(8-10). Here we show, through the assessment of time series data from 522 remote lakes and streams in North America and northern Europe, that rising trends in DOC between 1990 and 2004 can be concisely explained by a simple model based solely on changes in deposition chemistry and catchment acid-sensitivity. We demonstrate that DOC concentrations have increased in proportion to the rates at which atmospherically deposited anthropogenic sulphur and sea salt have declined. We conclude that acid deposition to these ecosystems has been partially buffered by changes in organic acidity and that the rise in DOC is integral to recovery from acidification. Over recent decades, deposition-driven increases in organic matter solubility may have increased the export of DOC to the oceans, a potentially important component of regional carbon balances(11). The increase in DOC concentrations in these regions appears unrelated to other climatic factors."], ["Thermolysis of fluoropolymers as a potential source of halogenated organic acids in the environment", "Following the introduction of hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbon (HFCs) gases as replacements for the ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), it has been discovered that HCFCs/HFCs can degrade in the atmosphere to produce trifluoroacetic acid(1), a compound with no known loss mechanisms in the environment(2,3), and higher concentrations in natural waters(4) have been shown to be mildly phytotoxic(5). Present environmental levels of trifluooracetic acid are not accounted by HCFC/HFC degradation alone(8-10). Here we report that thermolysis of fluorinated polymers, such as the commercial polymers Teflon and Kel-F, can also produce trifluoroacetate and the similar compound chlorodifluoroacetate. This can occur either directly, or indirectly via products that are known to degrade to these haloacetates in the atmosphere(11). The environmental significance of these findings is confirmed by modelling, which indicates that the thermolysis of fluoropolymers in industrial and consumer high-temperature applications (ovens, nonstick cooking utensils and combustion engines) is likely to be a significant source of trifluoroacetate in urban rain water (similar to 25 ng l(-1), as estimated for Toronto). Thermolysis also leads to longer chain polyfluoro- and/or polychlorofluoro- (C3-C14) carboxylic acids which may be equally persistent. Some of these products have recently been linked with possible adverse health(6) and environmental impacts and are being phased out of the US market(7). Furthermore, we detected CFCs and fluorocarbons- groups that can destroy ozone and act as greenhouse gases, respectively-among the other thermal degradation products, suggesting that continued use of fluoropolymers may also exacerbate stratospheric ozone-depletion and global warming."], ["Wafer-scale heterostructured piezoelectric bio-organic thin films", "Piezoelectric biomaterials are intrinsically suitable for coupling mechanical and electrical energy in biological systems to achieve in vivo real-time sensing, actuation, and electricity generation. However, the inability to synthesize and align the piezoelectric phase at a large scale remains a roadblock toward practical applications. We present a wafer-scale approach to creating piezoelectric biomaterial thin films based on \u03b3-glycine crystals. The thin film has a sandwich structure, where a crystalline glycine layer self-assembles and automatically aligns between two polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) thin films. The heterostructured glycine-PVA films exhibit piezoelectric coefficients of 5.3 picocoulombs per newton or 157.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 volt meters per newton and nearly an order of magnitude enhancement of the mechanical flexibility compared with pure glycine crystals. With its natural compatibility and degradability in physiological environments, glycine-PVA films may enable the development of transient implantable electromechanical devices."], ["Quantum simulation of antiferromagnetic spin chains in an optical lattice", "Understanding exotic forms of magnetism in quantum mechanical systems is a central goal of modern condensed matter physics, with implications for systems ranging from high-temperature superconductors to spintronic devices. Simulating magnetic materials in the vicinity of a quantum phase transition is computationally intractable on classical computers, owing to the extreme complexity arising from quantum entanglement between the constituent magnetic spins. Here we use a degenerate Bose gas of rubidium atoms confined in an optical lattice to simulate a chain of interacting quantum Ising spins as they undergo a phase transition. Strong spin interactions are achieved through a site-occupation to pseudo-spin mapping. As we vary a magnetic field, quantum fluctuations drive a phase transition from a paramagnetic phase into an antiferromagnetic phase. In the paramagnetic phase, the interaction between the spins is overwhelmed by the applied field, which aligns the spins. In the antiferromagnetic phase, the interaction dominates and produces staggered magnetic ordering. Magnetic domain formation is observed through both in situ site-resolved imaging and noise correlation measurements. By demonstrating a route to quantum magnetism in an optical lattice, this work should facilitate further investigations of magnetic models using ultracold atoms, thereby improving our understanding of real magnetic materials."], ["Transition Metal-Catalyzed C\u2013H Amination: Scope, Mechanism, and Applications", "Catalytic transformation of ubiquitous C\u2013H bonds into valuable C\u2013N bonds offers an efficient synthetic approach to construct N-functionalized molecules. Over the last few decades, transition metal catalysis has been repeatedly proven to be a powerful tool for the direct conversion of cheap hydrocarbons to synthetically versatile amino-containing compounds. This Review comprehensively highlights recent advances in intra- and intermolecular C\u2013H amination reactions utilizing late transition metal-based catalysts. Initial discovery, mechanistic study, and additional applications were categorized on the basis of the mechanistic scaffolds and types of reactions. Reactivity and selectivity of novel systems are discussed in three sections, with each being defined by a proposed working mode."], ["Mitochondrial stress is relayed to the cytosol by an OMA1-DELE1-HRI pathway", "In mammalian cells, mitochondrial dysfunction triggers the integrated stress response, in which the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2 alpha) results in the induction of the transcription factor ATF4(1-3). However, how mitochondrial stress is relayed to ATF4 is unknown. Here we show that HRI is the eIF2 alpha kinase that is necessary and sufficient for this relay. In a genome-wide CRISPR interference screen, we identified factors upstream of HRI: OMA1, a mitochondrial stress-activated protease; and DELE1, a little-characterized protein that we found was associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane. Mitochondrial stress stimulates OMA1-dependent cleavage of DELE1 and leads to the accumulation of DELE1 in the cytosol, where it interacts with HRI and activates the eIF2 alpha kinase activity of HRI. In addition, DELE1 is required for ATF4 translation downstream of eIF2 alpha phosphorylation. Blockade of the OMA1-DELE1-HRI pathway triggers an alternative response in which specific molecular chaperones are induced. The OMA1-DELE1-HRI pathway therefore represents a potential therapeutic target that could enable fine-tuning of the integrated stress response for beneficial outcomes in diseases that involve mitochondrial dysfunction. A genome-wide CRISPR interference screen shows that a signalling pathway involving OMA1, DELE1 and the eIF2 alpha kinase HRI relays mitochondrial stress to the cytosol to trigger the integrated stress response."], ["Impact of Glyme Ether Chain Length on the Interphasial Stability of Lithium-Electrode in High-Capacity Lithium-Metal Battery", "The realization of lithium-metal (Li) batteries faces challenges due to dendritic Li deposition causing internal short-circuit and low Coulombic efficiency. In this regard, the Li-deposition stability largely depends on the electrolyte, which reacts with Li to form a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with diverse physico-chemical properties, and dictates the interphasial kinetics. Therefore, optimizing the electrolyte for stability and performance remains pivotal. Hereof, glyme ethers are an emerging class of electrolytes, showing improved compatibility with metallic Li and enhanced stability in Li\u2500Air and Li\u2500Sulfur batteries. Yet, the criteria for selecting glyme solvents, particularly concerning Li deposition and dissolution processes, remain unclear. The SEI characteristics and Li deposition/dissolution processes are investigated in glyme-ether-based electrolytes with varying chain lengths, using lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and lithium nitrate (LiNO\u2083) salts under high capacity and limited electrolyte conditions. Longer glymes led to more homogeneous SEI, particularly pronounced with LiNO\u2083, minimizing surface roughness during stripping, and promoting compact Li deposits. Higher reductive stability, resulting in homogeneous interphasial properties, and slower kinetics due to high desolvation barrier and viscosity, underline stable Li growth in longer glymes. This study clarifies factors guiding the selection of glyme ether-based electrolytes in Li metal batteries, offering insights for next-generation energy storage systems."], ["Structural water as an essential comonomer in supramolecular polymerization", "Although the concept of structural water that is bound inside hydrophobic pockets and helps to stabilize protein structures is well established, water has rarely found a similar role in supramolecular polymers. Water is often used as a solvent for supramolecular polymerization, however without taking the role of a comonomer for the supramolecular polymer structure. We report a low\u2013molecular weight monomer whose supramolecular polymerization is triggered by the incorporation of water. The presence of water molecules as comonomers is essential to the polymerization process. The supramolecular polymeric material exhibits strong adhesion to surfaces, such as glass and paper. It can be used as a water-activated glue, which can be released at higher temperatures and reused many times without losing its performance."], ["Relationship between structural order and the anomalies of liquid water", "In contrast to crystalline solids-for which a precise framework exists for describing structure(1)-quantifying structural order in liquids and glasses has proved more difficult because even though such systems possess short-range order, they lack long-range crystalline order. Some progress has been made using model systems of hard spheres(2,3), but it remains difficult to describe accurately liquids such as water, where directional attractions (hydrogen bonds) combine with short-range repulsions to determine the relative orientation of neighbouring molecules as well as their instantaneous separation. This difficulty is particularly relevant when discussing the anomalous kinetic and thermodynamic properties of water, which have long been interpreted qualitatively in terms of underlying structural causes. Here we attempt to gain a quantitative understanding of these structure- property relationships through the study of translational(2,3) and orientational(4) order in a model(5) of water. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we identify a structurally anomalous region-bounded by loci of maximum orientational order (at low densities) and minimum translational order (at high densities)-in which order decreases on compression, and where orientational and translational order are strongly coupled. This region encloses the entire range of temperatures and densities for which the anomalous diffusivity(6-9) and thermal expansion coefficient(10) of water are observed, and enables us to quantify the degree of structural order needed for these anomalies to occur. We also find that these structural, kinetic and thermodynamic anomalies constitute a cascade: they occur consecutively as the degree of order is increased."], ["Electrically controlled water permeation through graphene oxide membranes", "Controlled transport of water molecules through membranes and capillaries is important in areas as diverse as water purification and healthcare technologies(1-7). Previous attempts to control water permeation through membranes (mainly polymeric ones) have concentrated on modulating the structure of the membrane and the physicochemical properties of its surface by varying the pH, temperature or ionic strength(3,8). Electrical control over water transport is an attractive alternative; however, theory and simulations(9-14) have often yielded conflicting results, from freezing of water molecules to melting of ice(14-16) under an applied electric field. Here we report electrically controlled water permeation through micrometre-thick graphene oxide membranes(17-21). Such membranes have previously been shown to exhibit ultrafast permeation of water(17,22) and molecular sieving properties(18,21), with the potential for industrial-scale production. To achieve electrical control over water permeation, we create conductive filaments in the graphene oxide membranes via controllable electrical breakdown. The electric field that concentrates around these current-carrying filaments ionizes water molecules inside graphene capillaries within the graphene oxide membranes, which impedes water transport. We thus demonstrate precise control of water permeation, from ultrafast permeation to complete blocking. Our work opens up an avenue for developing smart membrane technologies for artificial biological systems, tissue engineering and filtration."], ["Medium-scale carbon nanotube thin-film integrated circuits on flexible plastic substrates", "The ability to form integrated circuits on flexible sheets of plastic enables attributes (for example conformal and flexible formats and lightweight and shock resistant construction) in electronic devices that are difficult or impossible to achieve with technologies that use semiconductor wafers or glass plates as substrates(1). Organic small-molecule and polymer-based materials represent the most widely explored types of semiconductors for such flexible circuitry(2). Although these materials and those that use films or nanostructures of inorganics have promise for certain applications, existing demonstrations of them in circuits on plastic indicate modest performance characteristics that might restrict the application possibilities. Here we report implementations of a comparatively high-performance carbon-based semiconductor consisting of sub-monolayer, random networks of single-walled carbon nanotubes to yield small-to medium-scale integrated digital circuits, composed of up to nearly 100 transistors on plastic substrates. Transistors in these integrated circuits have excellent properties: mobilities as high as 80 cm(2)V(-1) s(-1), subthreshold slopes as low as 140 m V dec(-1), operating voltages less than 5 V together with deterministic control over the threshold voltages, on/off ratios as high as 10(5), switching speeds in the kilohertz range even for coarse (similar to 100-mu m) device geometries, and good mechanical flexibility - all with levels of uniformity and reproducibility that enable high- yield fabrication of integrated circuits. Theoretical calculations, in contexts ranging from heterogeneous percolative transport through the networks to compact models for the transistors to circuit level simulations, provide quantitative and predictive understanding of these systems. Taken together, these results suggest that sub-monolayer films of single-walled carbon nanotubes are attractive materials for flexible integrated circuits, with many potential areas of application in consumer and other areas of electronics."], ["A limit on the variation of the speed of light arising from quantum gravity effects", "A cornerstone of Einstein's special relativity is Lorentz invariance-the postulate that all observers measure exactly the same speed of light in vacuum, independent of photon-energy. While special relativity assumes that there is no fundamental length-scale associated with such invariance, there is a fundamental scale (the Planck scale, l(Planck) approximate to 1.62 x 10(-33) cm or E-Planck = M(Planck)c(2) approximate to 1.22 x 10(19) GeV), at which quantum effects are expected to strongly affect the nature of space-time. There is great interest in the (not yet validated) idea that Lorentz invariance might break near the Planck scale. A key test of such violation of Lorentz invariance is a possible variation of photon speed with energy(1-7). Even a tiny variation in photon speed, when accumulated over cosmological light-travel times, may be revealed by observing sharp features in gamma-ray burst (GRB) light-curves(2). Here we report the detection of emission up to similar to 31GeV from the distant and short GRB090510. We find no evidence for the violation of Lorentz invariance, and place a lower limit of 1.2E(Planck) on the scale of a linear energy dependence (or an inverse wavelength dependence), subject to reasonable assumptions about the emission (equivalently we have an upper limit of l(Planck)/1.2 on the length scale of the effect). Our results disfavour quantum-gravity theories(3,6,7) in which the quantum nature of space-time on a very small scale linearly alters the speed of light."], ["Identifying SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses in Malayan pangolins", "The ongoing outbreak of viral pneumonia in China and across the world is associated with a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2(1). This outbreak has been tentatively associated with a seafood market in Wuhan, China, where the sale of wild animals may be the source of zoonotic infection(2).Although bats are probable reservoir hosts for SARS-CoV-2, the identity of any intermediate host that may have facilitated transfer to humans is unknown. Here we report the identification of SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses in Malayan pangolins (Manisjavanica) seized in anti-smuggling operations in southern China. Metagenomic sequencing identified pangolin-associated coronaviruses that belong to two sub-lineages of SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses, including one that exhibits strong similarity in the receptor-binding domain to SARS-CoV-2. The discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin coronavirus and their similarity to SARS-CoV-2 suggests that pangolins should be considered as possible hosts in the emergence of new coronaviruses and should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission."], ["A platinum(II) metallonitrene with a triplet ground state", "Metallonitrenes (M\u2013N) are complexes with a subvalent atomic nitrogen ligand that have been proposed as key reactive intermediates in nitrogen atom transfer reactions. However, in contrast to the common classes of nitride complexes (M\u2261N) and organic nitrenes (R\u2013N), structurally and spectroscopically well defined \u2018authentic\u2019 metallonitrenes with a monovalent atomic nitrogen ligand remain elusive. Here we report that the photolysis of a platinum(II) pincer azide complex enabled the crystallographic, spectroscopic, magnetic and computational characterization of a metallonitrene that is best described as a singly bonded atomic nitrogen diradical ligand bound to platinum(II). The photoproduct exhibits selective C\u2013H, B\u2013H and B\u2013C nitrogen atom insertion reactivity. Despite the subvalent metallonitrene character, mechanistic analysis for aldehyde C\u2013H amidation shows nucleophilic reactivity of the N-diradical ligand.

Most humans have antibodies against S. aureus, but these are highly variable and often not protective in immunocompromised patients(3). Previous vaccine development programs have not been successful(4). A large percentage of human antibodies against S. aureus target wall teichoic acid (WTA), a ribitol-phosphate (RboP) surface polymer modified with N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)(5,6). It is currently unknown whether the immune evasion capacities of MRSA are due to variation of dominant surface epitopes such as those associated with WTA. Here we show that a considerable proportion of the prominent healthcare-associated and livestock-associated MRSA clones CC5 and CC398, respectively, contain prophages that encode an alternative WTA glycosyltransferase. This enzyme, TarP, transfers GlcNAc to a different hydroxyl group of the WTA RboP than the standard enzyme TarS(7), with important consequences for immune recognition. TarP-glycosylated WTA elicits 7.5-40-fold lower levels of immunoglobulin G in mice than TarS-modified WTA. Consistent with this, human sera contained only low levels of antibodies against TarP-modified WTA. Notably, mice immunized with TarS-modified WTA were not protected against infection with tarP-expressing MRSA, indicating that TarP is crucial for the capacity of S. aureus to evade host defences. High-resolution structural analyses of TarP bound to WTA components and uridine diphosphate GlcNAc (UDP-GlcNAc) explain the mechanism of altered RboP glycosylation and form a template for targeted inhibition of TarP. Our study reveals an immune evasion strategy of S. aureus based on averting the immunogenicity of its dominant glycoantigen WTA. These results will help with the identification of invariant S. aureus vaccine antigens and may enable the development of TarP inhibitors as a new strategy for rendering MRSA susceptible to human host defences."], ["Computational planning of the synthesis of complex natural products", "Training algorithms to computationally plan multistep organic syntheses has been a challenge for more than 50 years(1-7). However, the field has progressed greatly since the development of early programs such as LHASA(1,7), for which reaction choices at each step were made by human operators. Multiple software platforms(6,8-14) are now capable of completely autonomous planning. But these programs 'think' only one step at a time and have so far been limited to relatively simple targets, the syntheses of which could arguably be designed by human chemists within minutes, without the help of a computer. Furthermore, no algorithm has yet been able to design plausible routes to complex natural products, for which much more far-sighted, multistep planning is necessary(15,16) and closely related literature precedents cannot be relied on. Here we demonstrate that such computational synthesis planning is possible, provided that the program's knowledge of organic chemistry and data-based artificial intelligence routines are augmented with causal relationships(17,18), allowing it to 'strategize' over multiple synthetic steps. Using a Turing-like test administered to synthesis experts, we show that the routes designed by such a program are largely indistinguishable from those designed by humans. We also successfully validated three computer-designed syntheses of natural products in the laboratory. Taken together, these results indicate that expert-level automated synthetic planning is feasible, pending continued improvements to the reaction knowledge base and further code optimization. A synthetic route-planning algorithm, augmented with causal relationships that allow it to strategize over multiple steps, can design complex natural-product syntheses that are indistinguishable from those designed by human experts."], ["A protein functionalization platform based on selective reactions at methionine residues", "Nature has a remarkable ability to carry out site-selective post-translational modification of proteins, therefore enabling a marked increase in their functional diversity(1). Inspired by this, chemical tools have been developed for the synthetic manipulation of protein structure and function, and have become essential to the continued advancement of chemical biology, molecular biology and medicine. However, the number of chemical transformations that are suitable for effective protein functionalization is limited, because the stringent demands inherent to biological systems preclude the applicability of many potential processes(2). These chemical transformations often need to be selective at a single site on a protein, proceed with very fast reaction rates, operate under biologically ambient conditions and should provide homogeneous products with near-perfect conversion(2-7). Although many bioconjugation methods exist at cysteine, lysine and tyrosine, a method targeting a less-explored amino acid would considerably expand the protein functionalization toolbox. Here we report the development of a multifaceted approach to protein functionalization based on chemoselective labelling at methionine residues. By exploiting the electrophilic reactivity of a bespoke hypervalent iodine reagent, the S-Me group in the side chain of methionine can be targeted. The bioconjugation reaction is fast, selective, operates at low-micromolar concentrations and is complementary to existing bioconjugation strategies. Moreover, it produces a protein conjugate that is itself a high-energy intermediate with reactive properties and can serve as a platform for the development of secondary, visible-light-mediated bioorthogonal protein functionalization processes. The merger of these approaches provides a versatile platform for the development of distinct transformations that deliver information-rich protein conjugates directly from the native biomacromolecules."], ["Mechanical twisting of a guest by a photoresponsive host", "Molecular analogues of a variety of mechanical devices such as shuttles, brakes, unidirectional rotors and tweezers have been created(1-11). But these 'molecular machines' have not yet been used to mechanically manipulate a second molecule in a controlled and reversible manner. Here we show that light-induced scissor-like conformational changes of one molecule(5) can give rise to mechanical twisting of a non-covalently bound guest molecule. To realize this coupling of molecular motions, we use a previously designed system(5): a ferrocene moiety with an azobenzene strap, each end of which is attached to one of the two cyclopentadienyl rings of the ferrocene unit, acts as a pivot so that photoisomerization of the strap rotates the ferrocene rings relative to each other and thereby also changes the relative position of two 'pedal' moieties attached to the ferrocene rings. We translate this effect into intermolecular coupling of motion by endowing the pedals with binding sites, which allow the host system to form a stable complex with a bidentate rotor molecule. Using circular dichroism spectroscopy, we show that the photoinduced conformational changes of the host are indeed transmitted and induce mechanical twisting of the rotor molecule. This design concept, which significantly extends the successful coupling of motion beyond the intramolecular level seen in synthetic allosteric receptors(12), might allow for the remote control of molecular events in larger interlocked molecular systems."], ["Scalable production of high-performing woven lithium-ion fibre batteries", "Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries produced in the form of metre-long fibres can be woven into sturdy, washable textiles on an industrial loom and used to power other fabric-based electronic components. Fibre lithium-ion batteries are attractive as flexible power solutions because they can be woven into textiles, offering a convenient way to power future wearable electronics(1-4). However, they are difficult to produce in lengths of more than a few centimetres, and longer fibres were thought to have higher internal resistances(3,5) that compromised electrochemical performance(6,7). Here we show that the internal resistance of such fibres has a hyperbolic cotangent function relationship with fibre length, where it first decreases before levelling off as length increases. Systematic studies confirm that this unexpected result is true for different fibre batteries. We are able to produce metres of high-performing fibre lithium-ion batteries through an optimized scalable industrial process. Our mass-produced fibre batteries have an energy density of 85.69 watt hour per kilogram (typical values(8) are less than 1 watt hour per kilogram), based on the total weight of a lithium cobalt oxide/graphite full battery, including packaging. Its capacity retention reaches 90.5% after 500 charge-discharge cycles and 93% at 1C rate (compared with 0.1C rate capacity), which is comparable to commercial batteries such as pouch cells. Over 80 per cent capacity can be maintained after bending the fibre for 100,000 cycles. We show that fibre lithium-ion batteries woven into safe and washable textiles by industrial rapier loom can wirelessly charge a cell phone or power a health management jacket integrated with fibre sensors and a textile display."], ["BA.2.12.1, BA.4 and BA.5 escape antibodies elicited by Omicron infection", "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron sublineages BA.2.12.1, BA.4 and BA.5 exhibit higher transmissibility than the BA.2 lineage(1). The receptor binding and immune-evasion capability of these recently emerged variants require immediate investigation. Here, coupled with structural comparisons of the spike proteins, we show that BA.2.12.1, BA.4 and BA.5 (BA.4 and BA.5 are hereafter referred collectively to as BA.4/BA.5) exhibit similar binding affinities to BA.2 for the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Of note, BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/BA.5 display increased evasion of neutralizing antibodies compared with BA.2 against plasma from triple-vaccinated individuals or from individuals who developed a BA.1 infection after vaccination. To delineate the underlying antibody-evasion mechanism, we determined the escape mutation profiles(2), epitope distribution(3) and Omicron-neutralization efficiency of 1,640 neutralizing antibodies directed against the receptor-binding domain of the viral spike protein, including 614 antibodies isolated from people who had recovered from BA.1 infection. BA.1 infection after vaccination predominantly recalls humoral immune memory directed against ancestral (hereafter referred to as wild-type (WT)) SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The resulting elicited antibodies could neutralize both WT SARS-CoV-2 and BA.1 and are enriched on epitopes on spike that do not bind ACE2. However, most of these cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies are evaded by spike mutants L452Q, L452R and F486V. BA.1 infection can also induce new clones of BA.1-specific antibodies that potently neutralize BA.1. Nevertheless, these neutralizing antibodies are largely evaded by BA.2 and BA.4/BA.5 owing to D405N and F486V mutations, and react weakly to pre-Omicron variants, exhibiting narrow neutralization breadths. The therapeutic neutralizing antibodies bebtelovimab(4) and cilgavimab(5) can effectively neutralize BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/BA.5, where as the S371F, D405N and R408S mutations undermine most broadly sarbecovirus-neutralizing antibodies. Together, our results indicate that Omicron may evolve mutations to evade the humoral immunity elicited by BA.1 infection, suggesting that BA.1-derived vaccine boosters may not achieve broad-spectrum protection against new Omicron variants."], ["Light-driven post-translational installation of reactive protein side chains", "A wide range of side chains are installed into proteins by addition of photogenerated alkyl or difluroalkyl radicals, providing access to new functionality and reactivity in proteins. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) greatly expand the structures and functions of proteins in nature(1,2). Although synthetic protein functionalization strategies allow mimicry of PTMs3,4, as well as formation of unnatural protein variants with diverse potential functions, including drug carrying(5), tracking, imaging(6)and partner crosslinking(7), the range of functional groups that can be introduced remains limited. Here we describe the visible-light-driven installation of side chains at dehydroalanine residues in proteins through the formation of carbon-centred radicals that allow C-C bond formation in water. Control of the reaction redox allows site-selective modification with good conversions and reduced protein damage. In situ generation of boronic acid catechol ester derivatives generates RH(2)C(center dot)radicals that form the native (beta-CH2-gamma-CH2) linkage of natural residues and PTMs, whereas in situ potentiation of pyridylsulfonyl derivatives by Fe(ii) generates RF(2)C(center dot)radicals that form equivalent beta-CH2-gamma-CF(2)linkages bearing difluoromethylene labels. These reactions are chemically tolerant and incorporate a wide range of functionalities (more than 50 unique residues/side chains) into diverse protein scaffolds and sites. Initiation can be applied chemoselectively in the presence of sensitive groups in the radical precursors, enabling installation of previously incompatible side chains. The resulting protein function and reactivity are used to install radical precursors for homolytic on-protein radical generation; to study enzyme function with natural, unnatural and CF2-labelled post-translationally modified protein substrates via simultaneous sensing of both chemo- and stereoselectivity; and to create generalized 'alkylator proteins' with a spectrum of heterolytic covalent-bond-forming activity (that is, reacting diversely with small molecules at one extreme or selectively with protein targets through good mimicry at the other). Post-translational access to such reactions and chemical groups on proteins could be useful in both revealing and creating protein function."], ["Structural transformation in supercooled water controls the crystallization rate of ice", "One of water's unsolved puzzles is the question of what determines the lowest temperature to which it can be cooled before freezing to ice. The supercooled liquid has been probed experimentally to near the homogeneous nucleation temperature, T approximate to 232 K, yet the mechanism of ice crystallization-including the size and structure of critical nuclei-has not yet been resolved. The heat capacity and compressibility of liquid water anomalously increase on moving into the supercooled region, according to power laws that would diverge ( that is, approach infinity) at similar to 225K (refs 1, 2), so there may be a link between water's thermodynamic anomalies and the crystallization rate of ice. But probing this link is challenging because fast crystallization prevents experimental studies of the liquid below T-H. And although atomistic studies have captured water crystallization(3), high computational costs have so far prevented an assessment of the rates and mechanism involved. Here we report coarse-grained molecular simulations with the mW water model(4) in the supercooled regime around TH which reveal that a sharp increase in the fraction of four-coordinated molecules in supercooled liquid water explains its anomalous thermodynamics and also controls the rate and mechanisms of ice formation. The results of the simulations and classical nucleation theory using experimental data suggest that the crystallization rate of water reaches a maximum around 225 K, below which ice nuclei form faster than liquid water can equilibrate. This implies a lower limit of metastability of liquid water just below TH and well above its glass transition temperature, 136 K. By establishing a relationship between the structural transformation in liquid water and its anomalous thermodynamics and crystallization rate, our findings also provide mechanistic insight into the observed(5) dependence of homogeneous ice nucleation rates on the thermodynamics of water."], ["Polymers with controlled assembly and rigidity made with click-functional peptide bundles", "The engineering of biological molecules is a key concept in the design of highly functional, sophisticated soft materials. Biomolecules exhibit a wide range of functions and structures, including chemical recognition (of enzyme substrates or adhesive ligands(1), for instance), exquisite nanostructures (composed of peptides(2), proteins(3) or nucleic acids(4)), and unusual mechanical properties (such as silk-like strength(3), stiffness(5), viscoelasticity(6) and resiliency(7)). Here we combine the computational design of physical (noncovalent) interactions with pathway-dependent, hierarchical 'click' covalent assembly to produce hybrid synthetic peptide-based polymers. The nanometre-scale monomeric units of these polymers are homotetrameric, alpha-helical bundles of low-molecular-weight peptides. These bundled monomers, or 'bundlemers', can be designed to provide complete control of the stability, size and spatial display of chemical functionalities. The protein-like structure of the bundle allows precise positioning of covalent linkages between the ends of distinct bundlemers, resulting in polymers with interesting and controllable physical characteristics, such as rigid rods, semiflexible or kinked chains, and thermally responsive hydrogel networks. Chain stiffness can be controlled by varying only the linkage. Furthermore, by controlling the amino acid sequence along the bundlemer periphery, we use specific amino acid side chains, including non-natural 'click' chemistry functionalities, to conjugate moieties into a desired pattern, enabling the creation of a wide variety of hybrid nanomaterials."], ["Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor \u03b17 subunit is an essential regulator of inflammation", "Excessive inflammation and tumour-necrosis factor (TNF) synthesis cause morbidity and mortality in diverse human diseases including endotoxaemia, sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease(1-4). Highly conserved, endogenous mechanisms normally regulate the magnitude of innate immune responses and prevent excessive inflammation. The nervous system, through the vagus nerve, can inhibit significantly and rapidly the release of macrophage TNF, and attenuate systemic inflammatory responses(5-7). This physiological mechanism, termed the 'cholinergic anti- inflammatory pathway'(5) has major implications in immunology and in therapeutics; however, the identity of the essential macrophage acetylcholine-mediated (cholinergic) receptor that responds to vagus nerve signals was previously unknown. Here we report that the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha7 subunit is required for acetylcholine inhibition of macrophage TNF release. Electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve inhibits TNF synthesis in wild-type mice, but fails to inhibit TNF synthesis in alpha7-deficient mice. Thus, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha7 subunit is essential for inhibiting cytokine synthesis by the cholinergic anti- inflammatory pathway."], ["An origin of the radio jet in M87 at the location of the central black hole", "Powerful radio jets from active galactic nuclei are thought to be powered by the accretion of material onto the supermassive black hole (the 'central engine')(1,2). M87 is one of the closest examples of this phenomenon, and the structure of its jet has been probed on a scale of about 100 Schwarzschild radii (R(s), the radius of the event horizon)(3). However, the location of the central black hole relative to the jet base (a bright compact radio 'core') remains elusive(4,5). Observations of other jets indicate that the central engines are located about 10(4)-10(6)R(s) upstream from the radio core(6-9). Here we report radio observations of M87 at six frequencies that allow us to achieve a positional accuracy of about 20 microarcseconds. As the jet base becomes more transparent at higher frequencies, the multifrequency position measurements of the radio core enable us to determine the upstream end of the jet. The data reveal that the central engine of M87 is located within 14-23R(s) of the radio core at 43 GHz. This implies that the site of material infall onto the black hole and the eventual origin of the jet reside in the bright compact region seen on the image at 43 GHz."], ["Subterahertz collective dynamics of polar vortices", "The collective dynamics of topological structures(1-6) are of interest from both fundamental and applied perspectives. For example, studies of dynamical properties of magnetic vortices and skyrmions(3,4) have not only deepened our understanding of many-body physics but also offered potential applications in data processing and storage(7). Topological structures constructed from electrical polarization, rather than electron spin, have recently been realized in ferroelectric superlattices(5,6), and these are promising for ultrafast electric-field control of topological orders. However, little is known about the dynamics underlying the functionality of such complex extended nanostructures. Here, using terahertz-field excitation and femtosecond X-ray diffraction measurements, we observe ultrafast collective polarization dynamics that are unique to polar vortices, with orders-of-magnitude higher frequencies and smaller lateral size than those of experimentally realized magnetic vortices(3). A previously unseen tunable mode, hereafter referred to as a vortexon, emerges in the form of transient arrays of nanoscale circular patterns of atomic displacements, which reverse their vorticity on picosecond timescales. Its frequency is considerably reduced (softened) at a critical strain, indicating a condensation (freezing) of structural dynamics. We use first-principles-based atomistic calculations and phase-field modelling to reveal the microscopic atomic arrangements and corroborate the frequencies of the vortex modes. The discovery of subterahertz collective dynamics in polar vortices opens opportunities for electric-field-driven data processing in topological structures with ultrahigh speed and density."], ["Ecology drives a global network of gene exchange connecting the human microbiome", "Horizontal gene transfer (HGT), the acquisition of genetic material from non-parental lineages, is known to be important in bacterial evolution(1,2). In particular, HGT provides rapid access to genetic innovations, allowing traits such as virulence(3), antibiotic resistance(4) and xenobiotic metabolism(5) to spread through the human microbiome. Recent anecdotal studies providing snapshots of active gene flow on the human body have highlighted the need to determine the frequency of such recent transfers and the forces that govern these events(4,5). Here we report the discovery and characterization of a vast, human-associated network of gene exchange, large enough to directly compare the principal forces shaping HGT. We show that this network of 10,770 unique, recently transferred (more than 99% nucleotide identity) genes found in 2,235 full bacterial genomes, is shaped principally by ecology rather than geography or phylogeny, with most gene exchange occurring between isolates from ecologically similar, but geographically separated, environments. For example, we observe 25-fold more HGT between human-associated bacteria than among ecologically diverse non-human isolates (P = 3.0 x 10(-270)). We show that within the human microbiome this ecological architecture continues across multiple spatial scales, functional classes and ecological niches with transfer further enriched among bacteria that inhabit the same body site, have the same oxygen tolerance or have the same ability to cause disease. This structure offers a window into the molecular traits that define ecological niches, insight that we use to uncover sources of antibiotic resistance and identify genes associated with the pathology of meningitis and other diseases."], ["PLETHORA gradient formation mechanism separates auxin responses", "During plant growth, dividing cells in meristems must coordinate transitions from division to expansion and differentiation, thus generating three distinct developmental zones: the meristem, elongation zone and differentiation zone(1). Simultaneously, plants display tropisms, rapid adjustments of their direction of growth to adapt to environmental conditions. It is unclear how stable zonation is maintained during transient adjustments in growth direction. In Arabi-dopsis roots, many aspects of zonation are controlled by the phytohormone auxin and auxin-induced PLETHORA(PLT) transcription factors, both of which display a graded distribution with a maximum near the root tip(2-12). In addition, auxin is also pivotal for tropic responses(13,14). Here, using an iterative experimental and computational approach, we show how an interplay between auxin and PLTs controls zonation and gravitropism. We find that the PLT gradient is not a direct, proportionate readout of the auxin gradient. Rather, prolonged high auxin levels generate a narrow PLT transcription domain from which a gradient of PLT protein is subsequently generated through slow growth dilution and cell-to-cell movement. The resulting PLT levels define the location of developmental zones. In addition to slowly promoting PLT transcription, auxin also rapidly influences division, expansion and differentiation rates. We demonstrate how this specific regulatory design in which auxin cooperates with PLTs through different mechanisms and on different time scales enables both the fast tropic environmental responses and stable zonation dynamics necessary for coordinated cell differentiation."], ["An ultrafast rechargeable aluminium-ion battery", "The development of new rechargeable battery systems could fuel various energy applications, from personal electronics to grid storage(1,2). Rechargeable aluminium-based batteries offer the possibilities of low cost and low flammability, together with three-electron-redox properties leading to high capacity'. However, research efforts over the past 30 years have encountered numerous problems, such as cathode material disintegration'', low cell discharge voltage (about 0.55 volts; ref. 5), capacitive behaviour without discharge voltage plateaus (1.1-0.2 volts(6) or 1.8-0.8 volts(7)) and insufficient cycle life (less than 100 cycles) with rapid capacity decay (by 26-85 per cent over 100 cydes)(4-7). Here we present a rechargeable aluminium battery with high-rate capability that uses an aluminium metal anode and a three-dimensional graphitic-foam cathode. The battery operates through the electrochemical deposition and dissolution of aluminium at the anode, and intercalation/de-intercalation of chloroaluminate anions in the graphite, using a non-flammable ionic liquid electrolyte. The cell exhibits well-defined discharge voltage plateaus near 2 volts, a specific capacity of about 70 mA h g(-1) and a Coulombic efficiency of approximately 98 per cent. The cathode was found to enable fast anion diffusion and intercalation, affording charging times of around one minute with a current density of similar to 4,000 mA g(-1) (equivalent to similar to 3,000 W kg(-1)) and to withstand more than 7,500 cycles without capacity decay."], ["Structural and mechanistic insights into the bacterial amyloid secretion channel CsgG", "Curli are functional amyloid fibres that constitute the major protein component of the extracellular matrix in pellicle biofilms formed by Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria (predominantly of the alpha and gamma classes)(1-3). They provide a fitness advantage in pathogenic strains and induce a strong pro-inflammatory response during bacteraemia(1,4,5). Curli formation requires a dedicated protein secretion machinery comprising the outer membrane lipoprotein CsgG and two soluble accessory proteins, CsgE and CsgF(6,7). Here we report the X-ray structure of Escherichia coli CsgGin a non-lipidated, soluble form as well as in its native membrane-extracted conformation. CsgG forms an oligomeric transport complex composed of nine anticodon-binding-domain-like units that give rise to a 36-stranded beta-barrel that traverses the bilayer and is connected to a cage-like vestibule in the periplasm. The transmembrane and periplasmic domains are separated by a 0.9-nm channel constriction composed of three stacked concentric phenylalanine, asparagine and tyrosine rings that may guide the extended polypeptide substrate through the secretion pore. The specificity factor CsgE forms a nonameric adaptor that binds and closes off the periplasmic face of the secretion channel, creating a 24,000 angstrom(3) pre-constriction chamber. Our structural, functional and electrophysiological analyses imply that CsgG is an ungated, non-selective protein secretion channel that is expected to employ a diffusion-based, entropy-driven transport mechanism."], ["Lattice-strain control of the activity in dealloyed core\u2013shell fuel cell catalysts", "Electrocatalysis will play a key role in future energy conversion and storage technologies, such as water electrolysers, fuel cells and metal\u2013air batteries. Molecular interactions between chemical reactants and the catalytic surface control the activity and efficiency, and hence need to be optimized; however, generalized experimental strategies to do so are scarce. Here we show how lattice strain can be used experimentally to tune the catalytic activity of dealloyed bimetallic nanoparticles for the oxygen-reduction reaction, a key barrier to the application of fuel cells and metal\u2013air batteries. We demonstrate the core\u2013shell structure of the catalyst and clarify the mechanistic origin of its activity. The platinum-rich shell exhibits compressive strain, which results in a shift of the electronic band structure of platinum and weakening chemisorption of oxygenated species. We combine synthesis, measurements and an understanding of strain from theory to generate a reactivity\u2013strain relationship that provides guidelines for tuning electrocatalytic activity."], ["Inherent toxicity of aggregates implies a common mechanism for protein misfolding diseases", "A range of human degenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, light-chain amyloidosis and the spongiform encephalopathies, is associated with the deposition in tissue of proteinaceous aggregates known as amyloid fibrils or plaques. It has been shown previously that fibrillar aggregates that are closely similar to those associated with clinical amyloidoses can be formed in vitro from proteins not connected with these diseases, including the SH3 domain from bovine phosphatidyl-inositol-3'-kinase and the amino-terminal domain of the Escherichia coli HypF protein. Here we show that species formed early in the aggregation of these non-disease-associated proteins can be inherently highly cytotoxic. This finding provides added evidence that avoidance of protein aggregation is crucial for the preservation of biological function and suggests common features in the origins of this family of protein deposition diseases."], ["Molecular machines governing exocytosis of synaptic vesicles", "Calcium-dependent exocytosis of synaptic vesicles mediates the release of neurotransmitters. Important proteins in this process have been identified such as the SNAREs, synaptotagmins, complexins, Munc18 and Munc13.

However, it has been surprisingly difficult to arrive at a unified picture of the molecular sequence of events from vesicle docking to calcium-triggered membrane fusion. Using mainly a biochemical and biophysical perspective, we briefly survey the molecular mechanisms in an attempt to functionally integrate the key proteins into the emerging picture of the neuronal fusion machine."], ["A multinational Delphi consensus to end the COVID-19 public health threat", "Despite notable scientific and medical advances, broader political, socioeconomic and behavioural factors continue to undercut the response to the COVID-19 pandemic(1,2). Here we convened, as part of this Delphi study, a diverse, multidisciplinary panel of 386 academic, health, non-governmental organization, government and other experts in COVID-19 response from 112 countries and territories to recommend specific actions to end this persistent global threat to public health. The panel developed a set of 41 consensus statements and 57 recommendations to governments, health systems, industry and other key stakeholders across six domains: communication; health systems; vaccination; prevention; treatment and care; and inequities. In the wake of nearly three years of fragmented global and national responses, it is instructive to note that three of the highest-ranked recommendations call for the adoption of whole-of-society and whole-of-government approaches(1), while maintaining proven prevention measures using a vaccines-plus approach(2) that employs a range of public health and financial support measures to complement vaccination. Other recommendations with at least 99% combined agreement advise governments and other stakeholders to improve communication, rebuild public trust and engage communities(3) in the management of pandemic responses. The findings of the study, which have been further endorsed by 184 organizations globally, include points of unanimous agreement, as well as six recommendations with >5% disagreement, that provide health and social policy actions to address inadequacies in the pandemic response and help to bring this public health threat to an end."], ["Hyperbolic lattices in circuit quantum electrodynamics", "After two decades of development, cavity quantum electrodynamics with superconducting circuits has emerged as a rich platform for quantum computation and simulation. Lattices of coplanar waveguide resonators constitute artificial materials for microwave photons, in which interactions between photons can be incorporateded either through the use of nonlinear resonator materials or through coupling between qubits and resonators. Here we make use of the previously overlooked property that these lattice sites are deformable and permit tight-binding lattices that are unattainable even in solid-state systems. We show that networks of coplanar waveguide resonators can create a class of materials that constitute lattices in an effective hyperbolic space with constant negative curvature. We present numerical simulations of hyperbolic analogues of the kagome lattice that show unusual densities of states in which a macroscopic number of degenerate eigenstates comprise a spectrally isolated flat band. We present a proof-of-principle experimental realization of one such lattice.

In this reaction, typically two olefin subunits (two sigma-electrons per olefin) cyclize to form two new C-C sigma-bonds. Although the development of photochemical [2+2]-cycloadditions has made enormous progress within the last century, research has been focused on such [2 pi-2 pi]-systems, in which two pi-bonds are converted into two new sigma-bonds(1,2). Here we report an intermolecular [2+2]-photocycloaddition that uses bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes as 2 sigma-electron reactants(3,7). This strain-release-driven [2/T+20]-photocycloaddition reaction was realized by visible-light-mediated triplet energytransfer catalysis(8,9). A simple, modular and diastereoselective synthesis of bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes from heterocyclic olefin coupling partners, namely coumarins, flavones and indoles, is disclosed. Given the increasing importance of bicyclo[2.1.1] hexanes as bioisosteres-groupsthat convey similar biological propertiesto those they replace-in pharmaceutical research and considering their limited access(10,11), there remains a need for new synthetic methodologies. Applying this strategy enabled us to extend the intermolecular [2+2]-photocycloadditionsto a-bonds and provides previously inaccessible structural motifs."], ["Water splitting with silicon p-i-n superlattices suspended in solution", "Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting to produce hydrogen fuel was first reported 50 years ago(1), yet artificial photosynthesis has not become a widespread technology. Although planar Si solar cells have become a ubiquitous electrical energy source economically competitive with fossil fuels, analogous PEC devices have not been realized, and standard Si p-type/n- type (p-n) junctions cannot be used for water splitting because the bandgap precludes the generation of the needed photovoltage. An alternative paradigm, the particle suspension reactor (PSR), forgoes the rigid design in favour of individual PEC particles suspended in solution, a potentially low- cost option compared with planar systems(2,3). Here we report Si-based PSRs by synthesizing high-photovoltage multijunction Si nanowires (SiNWs) that are co-functionalized to catalytically split water. By encoding a p- type-intrinsic-n-type (p-i-n) superlattice within single SiNWs, tunable photovoltages exceeding 10 V were observed under 1 sun illumination. Spatioselective photoelectrodeposition of oxygen and hydrogen evolution co-catalysts enabled water splitting at infrared wavelengths up to approximately 1,050 nm, with the efficiency and spectral dependence of hydrogen generation dictated by the photonic characteristics of the sub-wavelength-diameter SiNWs. Although initial energy conversion efficiencies are low, multijunction SiNWs bring the photonic advantages of a tunable, mesoscale geometry and the material advantages of Si- including the small bandgap and economies of scale-to the PSR design, providing a new approach for water-splitting reactors."], ["Roton pair density wave in a strong-coupling kagome superconductor", "The transition metal kagome lattice materials host frustrated, correlated and topological quantum states of matter(1-9). Recently, a new family of vanadium-based kagome metals, AV(3)Sb(5) (A = K, Rb or Cs), with topological band structures has been discovered(10,11). These layered compounds are nonmagnetic and undergo charge density wave transitions before developing superconductivity at low temperatures(11-19). Here we report the observation of unconventional superconductivity and a pair density wave (PDW) in CsV3Sb5 using scanning tunnelling microscope/spectroscopy and Josephson scanning tunnelling spectroscopy. We find that CsV3Sb5 exhibits a V-shaped pairing gap Delta similar to 0.5 meV and is a strong-coupling superconductor (2 Delta/k(B)T(c) - 5) that coexists with 4a(0) unidirectional and 2a(0) x 2a(0) charge order. Remarkably, we discover a 3Q PDW accompanied by bidirectional 4a(0)/3 spatial modulations of the superconducting gap, coherence peak and gap depth in the tunnelling conductance. We term this novel quantum state a roton PDW associated with an underlying vortex-antivortex lattice that can account for the observed conductance modulations. Probing the electronic states in the vortex halo in an applied magnetic field, in strong field that suppresses superconductivity and in zero field above T-c, reveals that the PDW is a primary state responsible for an emergent pseudogap and intertwined electronic order. Our findings show striking analogies and distinctions to the phenomenology of high-T-c cuprate superconductors, and provide groundwork for understanding the microscopic origin of correlated electronic states and superconductivity in vanadium-based kagome metals."], ["High-efficiency two-dimensional Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite solar cells", "Three-dimensional organic-inorganic perovskites have emerged as one of the most promising thin-film solar cell materials owing to their remarkable photophysical properties(1-5), which have led to power conversion efficiencies exceeding 20 per cent(6,7), with the prospect of further improvements towards the Shockley-Queisser limit for a single-junction solar cell (33.5 per cent) (8). Besides efficiency, another critical factor for photovoltaics and other optoelectronic applications is environmental stability and photostability under operating conditions(9-15). In contrast to their three-dimensional counterparts, Ruddlesden-Popper phases-layered two-dimensional perovskite films-have shown promising stability, but poor efficiency at only 4.73 per cent(13,16,17). This relatively poor efficiency is attributed to the inhibition of out-of-plane charge transport by the organic cations, which act like insulating spacing layers between the conducting inorganic slabs. Here we overcome this issue in layered perovskites by producing thin films of near-single-crystalline quality, in which the crystallographic planes of the inorganic perovskite component have a strongly preferential out-of-plane alignment with respect to the contacts in planar solar cells to facilitate efficient charge transport. We report a photovoltaic efficiency of 12.52 per cent with no hysteresis, and the devices exhibit greatly improved stability in comparison to their three-dimensional counterparts when subjected to light, humidity and heat stress tests. Unencapsulated two-dimensional perovskite devices retain over 60 per cent of their efficiency for over 2,250 hours under constant, standard (AM1.5G) illumination, and exhibit greater tolerance to 65 per cent relative humidity than do three-dimensional equivalents. When the devices are encapsulated, the layered devices do not show any degradation under constant AM1.5G illumination or humidity. We anticipate that these results will lead to the growth of single-crystalline, solution-processed, layered, hybrid, perovskite thin films, which are essential for high-performance opto-electronic devices with technologically relevant long-term stability."], ["Rotational multimaterial printing of filaments with subvoxel control", "Helical structures are ubiquitous in nature and impart unique mechanical properties and multifunctionality1. So far, synthetic architectures that mimic these natural systems have been fabricated by winding, twisting and braiding of individual filaments(1-7), microfluidics(8,9), self-shaping(1,10-13) and printing methods(14-17). However, those fabrication methods are unable to simultaneously create and pattern multimaterial, helically architected filaments with subvoxel control in arbitrary two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) motifs from a broad range of materials. Towards this goal, both multimaterial18-23 and rotational24 3D printing of architected filaments have recently been reported; however, the integration of these two capabilities has yet to be realized. Here we report a rotational multimaterial 3D printing (RM-3DP) platform that enables subvoxel control over the local orientation of azimuthally heterogeneous architected filaments. By continuously rotating a multimaterial nozzle with a controlled ratio of angular-to-translational velocity, we have created helical filaments with programmable helix angle, layer thickness and interfacial area between several materials within a given cylindrical voxel. Using this integrated method, we have fabricated functional artificial muscles composed of helical dielectric elastomer actuators with high fidelity and individually addressable conductive helical channels embedded within a dielectric elastomer matrix. We have also fabricated hierarchical lattices comprising architected helical struts containing stiff springs within a compliant matrix.

This type of stress crazing is accelerated by solvents that are typically weak enough not to dissolve the polymer substantially, but which permeate and plasticize the polymer to facilitate the cavity and microfibril formation process(1-3). Here we show that microfibril and cavity formation in polymer films can be controlled and harnessed using standing-wave optics to design a periodic stress field within the film(4). We can then develop the periodic stress field with a weak solvent to create alternating layers of cavity and microfibril-filled polymers, in a process that we call organized stress microfibrillation. These multi-layered porous structures show structural colour across the full visible spectrum, and the colour can be tuned by varying the temperature and solvent conditions under which the films are developed. By further use of standard lithographic and masking tools, the organized stress microfibrillation process becomes an inkless, large-scale colour printing process generating images at resolutions of up to 14,000 dots per inch on a number of flexible and transparent formats(5,6)."], ["Design of biologically active binary protein 2D materials", "Ordered two-dimensional arrays such as S-layers(1,2) and designed analogues(3-5) have intrigued bioengineers(6,7), but with the exception of a single lattice formed with flexible linkers(8), they are constituted from just one protein component. Materials composed of two components have considerable potential advantages for modulating assembly dynamics and incorporating more complex functionality(9-)(12). Here we describe a computational method to generate co-assembling binary layers by designing rigid interfaces between pairs of dihedral protein building blocks, and use it to design a p6m lattice. The designed array components are soluble at millimolar concentrations, but when combined at nanomolar concentrations, they rapidly assemble into nearly crystalline micrometre-scale arrays nearly identical to the computational design model in vitro and in cells without the need for a two-dimensional support. Because the material is designed from the ground up, the components can be readily functionalized and their symmetry reconfigured, enabling formation of ligand arrays with distinguishable surfaces, which we demonstrate can drive extensive receptor clustering, downstream protein recruitment and signalling. Using atomic force microscopy on supported bilayers and quantitative microscopy on living cells, we show that arrays assembled on membranes have component stoichiometry and structure similar to arrays formed in vitro, and that our material can therefore impose order onto fundamentally disordered substrates such as cell membranes. In contrast to previously characterized cell surface receptor binding assemblies such as antibodies and nanocages, which are rapidly endocytosed, we find that large arrays assembled at the cell surface suppress endocytosis in a tunable manner, with potential therapeutic relevance for extending receptor engagement and immune evasion.

Interactions between electrons and the topology of their energy bands can create unusual quantum phases of matter. Most topological electronic phases appear in systems with weak electron-electron interactions. The instances in which topological phases emerge only as a result of strong interactions are rare and mostly limited to those realized in intense magnetic fields(1). The discovery of flat electronic bands with topological character in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) has created a unique opportunity to search for strongly correlated topological phases(2-9). Here we introduce a local spectroscopic technique using a scanning tunnelling microscope to detect a sequence of topological insulators in MATBG with Chern numbers C = +/- 1, +/- 2 and +/- 3, which form near filling factors of +/- 3, +/- 2 and +/- 1 electrons per moire unit cell, respectively, and are stabilized by modest magnetic fields. One of the phases detected here (C = +1) was previously observed when the sublattice symmetry of MATBG was intentionally broken by a hexagonal boron nitride substrate, with interactions having a secondary role(9). We demonstrate that strong electron-electron interactions alone can produce not only the previously observed phase, but also other unexpected Chern insulating phases in MATBG. The full sequence of phases that we observe can be understood by postulating that strong correlations favour breaking time-reversal symmetry to form Chern insulators that are stabilized by weak magnetic fields. Our findings illustrate that many-body correlations can create topological phases in moire systems beyond those anticipated from weakly interacting models."], ["Identification of protein pheromones that promote aggressive behaviour", "Mice use pheromones, compounds emitted and detected by members of the same species, as cues to regulate social behaviours such as pup suckling, aggression and mating(1). Neurons that detect pheromones are thought to reside in at least two separate organs within the nasal cavity: the vomeronasal organ (VNO) and the main olfactory epithelium (MOE)(2). Each pheromone ligand is thought to activate a dedicated subset of these sensory neurons. However, the nature of the pheromone cues and the identity of the responding neurons that regulate specific social behaviours are largely unknown. Here we show, by direct activation of sensory neurons and analysis of behaviour, that at least two chemically distinct ligands are sufficient to promote male-male aggression and stimulate VNO neurons. We have purified and analysed one of these classes of ligand and found its specific aggression-promoting activity to be dependent on the presence of the protein component of the major urinary protein (MUP) complex, which is known to comprise specialized lipocalin proteins bound to small organic molecules(1,3,4). Using calcium imaging of dissociated vomeronasal neurons (VNs), we have determined that the MUP protein activates a sensory neuron subfamily characterized by the expression of the G-protein G alpha(o) subunit ( also known as Gnao) and Vmn2r putative pheromone receptors (V2Rs). Genomic analysis indicates species-specific co-expansions of MUPs and V2Rs, as would be expected among pheromone-signalling components. Finally, we show that the aggressive behaviour induced by the MUPs occurs exclusively through VNO neuronal circuits. Our results substantiate the idea of MUP proteins as pheromone ligands that mediate male-male aggression through the accessory olfactory neural pathway."], ["Cu(ii/i) redox couples: potential alternatives to traditional electrolytes for dye-sensitized solar cells", "The redox shuttle is one of the essential ingredients in dye-sensitized solar cell devices. Though the I\u2212/I3\u2212 redox couple has dominated in the last couple of decades, however, due to the loss of open-circuit potential, complementary absorption with a sensitizer and the volatile nature restricts the module development. Metal complexes with variable oxidation states are probable alternative candidates as redox shuttles due to the change in their redox potentials with varying ligands in order to suit different sensitizers. Co(III/II) redox couples using polypyridyl ligands have been widely used in DSSC and have crossed the device efficiency of 14%. However, mass transport constraints and health hazards exist due to the commercialization of technology. Inspired from biological electron transfer reactions, Cu(II/I) redox shuttles have gained much attention as redox couples for DSSC applications in recent years. Particularly in low light conditions, it minimizes mass transport, has a device efficiency greater than 32%, and has potential in Internet of Things (IoT) applications.

Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors have attracted intense interest for their unique photophysical properties, including large exciton binding energies and strong gate tunability, which arise from their reduced dimensionality(1-5). Despite considerable efforts, a disconnect persists between the fundamental photophysics in pristine 2D semiconductors and the practical device performances, which are often plagued by many extrinsic factors, including chemical disorder at the semiconductor-contact interface. Here, by using van der Waals contacts with minimal interfacial disorder, we suppress contact-induced Shockley-Read-Hall recombination and realize nearly intrinsic photophysics-dictated device performance in 2D semiconductor diodes. Using an electrostatic field in a split-gate geometry to independently modulate electron and hole doping in tungsten diselenide diodes, we discover an unusual peak in the short-circuit photocurrent at low charge densities. Time-resolved photoluminescence reveals a substantial decrease of the exciton lifetime from around 800 picoseconds in the charge-neutral regime to around 50 picoseconds at high doping densities owing to increased exciton-charge Auger recombination. Taken together, we show that an exciton-diffusion-limited model well explains the charge-density-dependent short-circuit photocurrent, a result further confirmed by scanning photocurrent microscopy. We thus demonstrate the fundamental role of exciton diffusion and two-body exciton-charge Auger recombination in 2D devices and highlight that the intrinsic photophysics of 2D semiconductors can be used to create more efficient optoelectronic devices."], ["Controlling many-body states by the electric-field effect in a two-dimensional material", "To understand the complex physics of a system with strong electron-electron interactions, the ideal is to control and monitor its properties while tuning an external electric field applied to the system (the electric-field effect). Indeed, complete electric-field control of many-body states in strongly correlated electron systems is fundamental to the next generation of condensed matter research and devices(1-3). However, the material must be thin enough to avoid shielding of the electric field in the bulk material. Two-dimensional materials do not experience electrical screening, and their charge-carrier density can be controlled by gating. Octahedral titanium diselenide (1T-TiSe2) is a prototypical two-dimensional material that reveals a charge-density wave (CDW) and superconductivity in its phase diagram(4), presenting several similarities with other layered systems such as copper oxides(5), iron pnictides(6), and crystals of rare-earth elements and actinide atoms(7). By studying 1T-TiSe2 single crystals with thicknesses of 10 nanometres or less, encapsulated in two-dimensional layers of hexagonal boron nitride, we achieve unprecedented control over the CDW transition temperature (tuned from 170 kelvin to 40 kelvin), and over the superconductivity transition temperature (tuned from a quantum critical point at 0 kelvin up to 3 kelvin). Electrically driving TiSe2 over different ordered electronic phases allows us to study the details of the phase transitions between many-body states. Observations of periodic oscillations of magnetoresistance induced by the Little-Parks effect show that the appearance of superconductivity is directly correlated with the spatial texturing of the amplitude and phase of the superconductivity order parameter, corresponding to a two-dimensional matrix of superconductivity. We infer that this superconductivity matrix is supported by a matrix of incommensurate CDW states embedded in the commensurate CDW states. Our results show that spatially modulated electronic states are fundamental to the appearance of two-dimensional superconductivity."], ["Photocontrolled reversible release of guest molecules from coumarin-modified mesoporous silica", "Since the discovery(1) of MCM-41 more than ten years ago, many investigations have explored the suitability of hexagonal mesoporous silicas for potential practical applications(2-4). These range from catalysis(5,6) and optically active materials(7,8) to polymerization science(9-12), separation technology(3,13,14) and drug delivery(15-18), with recent successes in the fabrication of hybrid mesoporous organosilicas(19-21) expected to open up further application possibilities. Because the pore voids of this class of materials exhibit relatively narrow pore size distributions in the range of 2-4 nm in diameter, mesoporous silicas can selectively include organic compounds and release them continuously at a later stage. The functionalization of MCM-41 pore voids with photoactive derivatives(22-25) provides influence over the material's absorption behaviour, but full control over the release process remains difficult. Here we show that the uptake, storage and release of organic molecules in MCM-41 can be regulated through the photocontrolled and reversible intermolecular dimerization 26,27 of coumarin derivatives attached to the pore outlets. Successful functionalization requires uncalcined MCM-41 still filled with the template molecules that directed the formation of its pores, to ensure that coumarin derivatives attach preferentially to the pore outlets, rather than their inside walls. We find that this feature and the one-dimensional, isolated nature of the individual pores allow for efficient and reversible photocontrol over guest access to the material's interior."], ["An integrated design and fabrication strategy for entirely soft, autonomous robots", "Soft robots possess many attributes that are difficult, if not impossible, to achieve with conventional robots composed of rigid materials(1,2). Yet, despite recent advances, soft robots must still be tethered to hard robotic control systems and power sources(3-10). New strategies for creating completely soft robots, including soft analogues of these crucial components, are needed to realize their full potential. Here we report the untethered operation of a robot composed solely of soft materials. The robot is controlled with microfluidic logic(11) that autonomously regulates fluid flow and, hence, catalytic decomposition of an on-board monopropellant fuel supply. Gas generated from the fuel decomposition inflates fluidic networks downstream of the reaction sites, resulting in actuation(12). The body and microfluidic logic of the robot are fabricated using moulding and soft lithography, respectively, and the pneumatic actuator networks, on-board fuel reservoirs and catalytic reaction chambers needed for movement are patterned within the body via a multi-material, embedded 3D printing technique(13,14). The fluidic and elastomeric architectures required for function span several orders of magnitude from the microscale to the macroscale. Our integrated design and rapid fabrication approach enables the programmable assembly of multiple materials within this architecture, laying the foundation for completely soft, autonomous robots."], ["RAF inhibitor resistance is mediated by dimerization of aberrantly spliced BRAF(V600E)", "Activated RAS promotes dimerization of members of the RAF kinase family(1-3). ATP-competitive RAF inhibitors activate ERK signalling(4-7) by transactivating RAF dimers(4). In melanomas with mutant BRAF(V600E), levels of RAS activation are low and these drugs bind to BRAF(V600E) monomers and inhibit their activity. This tumour-specific inhibition of ERK signalling results in a broad therapeutic index and RAF inhibitors have remarkable clinical activity in patients with melanomas that harbour mutant BRAF(V600E)(8). However, resistance invariably develops. Here, we identify a new resistance mechanism. We find that a subset of cells resistant to vemurafenib (PLX4032, RG7204) express a 61-kDa variant form of BRAF(V600E), p61BRAF(V600E), which lacks exons 4-8, a region that encompasses the RAS-binding domain. p61BRAF(V600E) shows enhanced dimerization in cells with low levels of RAS activation, as compared to full-length BRAF(V600E). In cells in which p61BRAF(V600E) is expressed endogenously or ectopically, ERK signalling is resistant to the RAF inhibitor. Moreover, a mutation that abolishes the dimerization of p61BRAF(V600E) restores its sensitivity to vemurafenib. Finally, we identified BRAF(V600E) splicing variants lacking the RAS-binding domain in the tumours of six of nineteen patients with acquired resistance to vemurafenib. These data support the model that inhibition of ERK signalling by RAF inhibitors is dependent on levels of RAS-GTP too low to support RAF dimerization and identify a novel mechanism of acquired resistance in patients: expression of splicing isoforms of BRAF(V600E) that dimerize in a RAS-independent manner."], ["Towards uranium catalysts", "The forefront of research into the complexes of uranium reveals chemical transformations that challenge and expand our view of this unique element. Certain ligands form multiple bonds to uranium, and small, inert molecules such as nitrogen and carbon dioxide become reactive when in complex with the metal. Such complexes provide clues to the catalytic future of uranium, in which the applications of the element extend far beyond the nuclear industry. Most excitingly, the ability of uranium to use its outermost f electrons for binding ligands might enable the element to catalyse reactions that are impossible with conventional, transition- metal catalysts."], ["Functional cartography of complex metabolic networks", "High-throughput techniques are leading to an explosive growth in the size of biological databases and creating the opportunity to revolutionize our understanding of life and disease. Interpretation of these data remains, however, a major scientific challenge. Here, we propose a methodology that enables us to extract and display information contained in complex networks(1-3). Specifically, we demonstrate that we can find functional modules(4,5) in complex networks, and classify nodes into universal roles according to their pattern of intra- and inter-module connections. The method thus yields a 'cartographic representation' of complex networks. Metabolic networks(6-8) are among the most challenging biological networks and, arguably, the ones with most potential for immediate applicability(9). We use our method to analyse the metabolic networks of twelve organisms from three different superkingdoms. We find that, typically, 80% of the nodes are only connected to other nodes within their respective modules, and that nodes with different roles are affected by different evolutionary constraints and pressures. Remarkably, we find that metabolites that participate in only a few reactions but that connect different modules are more conserved than hubs whose links are mostly within a single module."], ["Bacteria activate sensory neurons that modulate pain and inflammation", "Nociceptor sensory neurons are specialized to detect potentially damaging stimuli, protecting the organism by initiating the sensation of pain and eliciting defensive behaviours. Bacterial infections produce pain by unknown molecular mechanisms, although they are presumed to be secondary to immune activation. Here we demonstrate that bacteria directly activate nociceptors, and that the immune response mediated through TLR2, MyD88, T cells, B cells, and neutrophils and monocytes is not necessary for Staphylococcus aureus-induced pain in mice. Mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia in mice is correlated with live bacterial load rather than tissue swelling or immune activation. Bacteria induce calcium flux and action potentials in nociceptor neurons, in part via bacterial N-formylated peptides and the pore-forming toxin alpha-haemolysin, through distinct mechanisms. Specific ablation of Nav1.8-lineage neurons, which include nociceptors, abrogated pain during bacterial infection, but concurrently increased local immune infiltration and lymphadenopathy of the draining lymph node. Thus, bacterial pathogens produce pain by directly activating sensory neurons that modulate inflammation, an unsuspected role for the nervous systemin host-pathogen interactions."], ["Chemical genetics strategy identifies an HCV NS5A inhibitor with a potent clinical effect", "The worldwide prevalence of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is estimated to be approaching 200 million people(1). Current therapy relies upon a combination of pegylated interferon-alpha and ribavirin, a poorly tolerated regimen typically associated with less than 50% sustained virological response rate in those infected with genotype 1 virus(2,3). The development of direct-acting antiviral agents to treat HCV has focused predominantly on inhibitors of the viral enzymes NS3 protease and the RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase NS5B(4). Here we describe the profile of BMS-790052, a small molecule inhibitor of the HCV NS5A protein that exhibits picomolar half-maximum effective concentrations (EC50) towards replicons expressing a broad range of HCV genotypes and the JFH-1 genotype 2a infectious virus in cell culture. In a phase I clinical trial in patients chronically infected with HCV, administration of a single 100-mg dose of BMS-790052 was associated with a 3.3 log(10) reduction in mean viral load measured 24 h post-dose that was sustained for an additional 120 h in two patients infected with genotype 1b virus. Genotypic analysis of samples taken at baseline, 24 and 144 h post-dose revealed that the major HCV variants observed had substitutions at amino-acid positions identified using the in vitro replicon system. These results provide the first clinical validation of an inhibitor of HCV NS5A, a protein with no known enzymatic function, as an approach to the suppression of virus replication that offers potential as part of a therapeutic regimen based on combinations of HCV inhibitors."], ["Reducing the contact time of a bouncing drop", "Surfaces designed so that drops do not adhere to them but instead bounce off have received substantial attention because of their ability to stay dry(1-4), self-clean(5-7) and resist icing(8-10). A drop striking a non-wetting surface of this type will spread out to a maximum diameter(11-14) and then recoil to such an extent that it completely rebounds and leaves the solid material(15-18). The amount of time that the drop is in contact with the solid-the 'contact time'-depends on the inertia and capillarity of the drop(1), internal dissipation(19) and surface-liquid interactions(20-22). And because contact time controls the extent to which mass, momentum and energy are exchanged between drop and surface(23), it is often advantageous to minimize it. The conventional approach has been to minimize surface-liquid interactions that can lead to contact line pinning(20-22); but even in the absence of any surface interactions, drop hydrodynamics imposes a minimum contact time that was conventionally assumed to be attained with axisymmetrically spreading and recoiling drops(21,24). Here we demonstrate that it is possible to reduce the contact time below this theoretical limit by using superhydrophobic surfaces with a morphology that redistributes the liquid mass and thereby alters the drop hydrodynamics. We show theoretically and experimentally that this approach allows us to reduce the overall contact time between a bouncing drop and a surface below what was previously thought possible."], ["Observation of moire excitons in WSe<sub>2</sub>/WS<sub>2</sub> heterostructure superlattices", "Moire superlattices enable the generation of new quantum phenomena in two-dimensional heterostructures, in which the interactions between the atomically thin layers qualitatively change the electronic band structure of the superlattice. For example, mini-Dirac points, tunable Mott insulator states and the Hofstadter butterfly pattern can emerge in different types of graphene/boron nitride moire superlattices, whereas correlated insulating states and superconductivity have been reported in twisted bilayer graphene moire superlattices(1-12). In addition to their pronounced effects on single-particle states, moire superlattices have recently been predicted to host excited states such as moire exciton bands(13-15). Here we report the observation of moire superlattice exciton states in tungsten diselenide/tungsten disulfide (WSe2/WS2) heterostructures in which the layers are closely aligned. These moire exciton states manifest as multiple emergent peaks around the original WSe2 A exciton resonance in the absorption spectra, and they exhibit gate dependences that are distinct from that of the A exciton in WSe2 monolayers and in WSe2/WS2 heterostructures with large twist angles. These phenomena can be described by a theoretical model in which the periodic moire potential is much stronger than the exciton kinetic energy and generates multiple flat exciton minibands. The moire exciton bands provide an attractive platform from which to explore and control excited states of matter, such as topological excitons and a correlated exciton Hubbard model, in transitionmetal dichalcogenides."], ["Tuning clathrate hydrates for hydrogen storage", "The storage of large quantities of hydrogen at safe pressures(1) is a key factor in establishing a hydrogen-based economy. Previous strategies-where hydrogen has been bound chemically(2), adsorbed in materials with permanent void space(3) or stored in hybrid materials that combine these elements(3)-have problems arising from either technical considerations or materials cost(2-5). A recently reported(6-8) clathrate hydrate of hydrogen exhibiting two different-sized cages does seem to meet the necessary storage requirements; however, the extreme pressures (similar to 2 kbar) required to produce the material make it impractical. The synthesis pressure can be decreased by filling the larger cavity with tetrahydrofuran (THF) to stabilize the material(9), but the potential storage capacity of the material is compromised with this approach. Here we report that hydrogen storage capacities in THF-containing binary-clathrate hydrates can be increased to similar to 4wt% at modest pressures by tuning their composition to allow the hydrogen guests to enter both the larger and the smaller cages, while retaining low-pressure stability. The tuning mechanism is quite general and convenient, using water-soluble hydrate promoters and various small gaseous guests."], ["Cleavable comonomers enable degradable, recyclable thermoset plastics", "Thermosets-polymeric materials that adopt a permanent shape upon curing-have a key role in the modern plastics and rubber industries, comprising about 20 per cent of polymeric materials manufactured today, with a worldwide annual production of about 65 million tons(1,2). The high density of crosslinks that gives thermosets their useful properties (for example, chemical and thermal resistance and tensile strength) comes at the expense of degradability and recyclability. Here, using the industrial thermoset polydicyclopentadiene as a model system, we show that when a small number of cleavable bonds are selectively installed within the strands of thermosets using a comonomer additive in otherwise traditional curing workflows, the resulting materials can display the same mechanical properties as the native material, but they can undergo triggered, mild degradation to yield soluble, recyclable products of controlled size and functionality. By contrast, installation of cleavable crosslinks, even at much higher loadings, does not produce degradable materials. These findings reveal that optimization of the cleavable bond location can be used as a design principle to achieve controlled thermoset degradation. Moreover, we introduce a class of recyclable thermosets poised for rapid deployment. A method of endowing thermoset plastics with a degree of recyclability and reprocessability by incorporating cleavable chemical linkages in the strands of the polymer, rather than in the crosslinks, is presented."], ["A 3D extra-large-pore zeolite enabled by 1D-to-3Dtopotactic condensation of a chain silicate", "Zeolites are microporous silicates with a large variety of applications as catalysts, adsorbents, and cation exchangers. Stable silica-based zeolites with increased porosity are in demand to allow adsorption and processing of large molecules but challenge our synthetic ability. We report a new, highly stable pure silica zeolite called ZEO-3, which has a multidimensional, interconnected system of extra-large pores open through windows made by 16 and 14 silicate tetrahedra, the least dense polymorph of silica known so far. This zeolite was formed by an unprecedented one-dimensional to three-dimensional (1D-to-3D) topotactic condensation of a chain silicate. With a specific surface area of more than 1000 square meters per gram, ZEO-3 showed a high performance for volatile organic compound abatement and recovery compared with other zeolites and metal-organic frameworks."], ["Simulated response of the ocean carbon cycle to anthropogenic climate warming", "A 1995 report(1) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change provides a set of illustrative anthropogenic CO2 emission models leading to stabilization of atmospheric CO2 concentrations ranging from 350 to 1,000 p.p.m. (refs 1-4). Ocean carbon-cycle models used in calculating these scenarios assume that oceanic circulation and biology remain unchanged through time. Here we examine the importance of this assumption by using a coupled atmosphere-ocean model of global warming(5) for the period 1765 to 2065. We find a large potential modification to the ocean carbon sink in a vast region of the Southern Ocean where increased rainfall leads to surface freshening and increased stratification(6). The increased stratification reduces the downward flux of carbon and the loss of heat to the atmosphere, both of which decrease the oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2 relative to a constant-climate control scenario. Changes in the formation, transport and cycling of biological material may counteract the reduced uptake, but the response of the biological community to the climate change is difficult to predict on present understanding. Our simulation suggests that such physical and biological changes might already be occurring, and that they could substantially affect the ocean carbon sink over the next few decades."], ["Are they linear, bent, or cyclic? Quantum chemical investigation of the heavier group 14 and group 15 homologues of HCN and HNC", "The singlet potential-energy surface (PES) of the system involving the atoms H, X, and E (the (H, X, E) system) in which X=N-Bi and E=C-Pb has been explored at the CCSD(T)/TZVPP and BP86/TZ2P+ levels of theory. The nature of the X-E bonding has been analyzed with charge- and energy-partitioning methods. The calculations show that the linear isomers of the nitrogen systems lin-HEN and lin-HNE are minima on the singlet PES. The carbon compound lin-HCN (HCN=hydrogen cyanide) is 14.9 kcal mol(-1) lower in energy than lin-HNC but the heavier group 14 homologues lin-HEN (E=Si-Pb) are between 64.8 and 71.5 kcal mol(-1) less stable than the lin-HNE isomers. The phosphorous system (H, P, E) exhibits significant differences concerning the geometry and stability of the equilibrium structures compared with the nitrogen system. The linear form lin-HEP of the former system is much more stable than lin-HPE. The molecule lin-HCP is the only minimum on the singlet PES. It is 78.5 kcal mol(-1) lower in energy than lin-HPC, which is a second-order saddle point. The heavier homologues lin-HPE, in which E=Si-Pb, are also second-order saddle points, whereas the bent-HPE structures are the global minima on the PES. They are between 10.3 (E=Si) and 36.5 kcal mol(-1) (E=Pb) lower in energy than lin-HEP. The bent-HPE structures possess rather acute bending angles H-P-E between 60.1 (E=Si) and 79.7\u00b0 (E=Pb). The energy differences between the heavier group 15 isomers lin-HEX (X=P-Bi) and the bent structures bent-HXE become continuously smaller. The silicon species lin-HSiBi is even 3.1 kcal mol(-1) lower in energy than bent-HBiSi. The bending angle H-X-E becomes more acute when X becomes heavier. The drastic energy differences between the isomers of the system (H, X, E) are explained with three factors that determine the relative stabilities of the energy minima: 1) The different bond strength between the hydrogen bonds H-X and H-E. 2) The electronic excitation energy of the fragment HE from the X (2)\u03a0 ground state to the (4)\u03a3(-) excited state, which is required to establish a E\u2261X triple bond in the molecules lin-HEX. 3) The strength of the intrinsic X-E interactions in the molecules.

Both techniques are scalable, and scientists and engineers are adapting them to different two-dimensional starting materials to create structures from the macro-to the microscale(1,2). Here we show that graphene(3-6) is well suited for kirigami, allowing us to build robust microscale structures with tunable mechanical properties. The material parameter crucial for kirigami is the Foppl-von Karman number(7,8) gamma: an indication of the ratio between in-plane stiffness and out-of-plane bending stiffness, with high numbers corresponding to membranes that more easily bend and crumple than they stretch and shear. To determine gamma, we measure the bending stiffness of graphene monolayers that are 10-100 micrometres in size and obtain a value that is thousands of times higher than the predicted atomic-scale bending stiffness. Interferometric imaging attributes this finding to ripples in the membrane(9-13) that stiffen the graphene sheets considerably, to the extent that gamma is comparable to that of a standard piece of paper. We may therefore apply ideas from kirigami to graphene sheets to build mechanical metamaterials such as stretchable electrodes, springs, and hinges. These results establish graphene kirigami as a simple yet powerful and customizable approach for fashioning one-atom-thick graphene sheets into resilient and movable parts with microscale dimensions."], ["Simultaneous determination of protein structure and dynamics", "We present a protocol for the experimental determination of ensembles of protein conformations that represent simultaneously the native structure and its associated dynamics. The procedure combines the strengths of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy-for obtaining experimental information at the atomic level about the structural and dynamical features of proteins-with the ability of molecular dynamics simulations to explore a wide range of protein conformations. We illustrate the method for human ubiquitin in solution and find that there is considerable conformational heterogeneity throughout the protein structure. The interior atoms of the protein are tightly packed in each individual conformation that contributes to the ensemble but their overall behaviour can be described as having a significant degree of liquid-like character. The protocol is completely general and should lead to significant advances in our ability to understand and utilize the structures of native proteins."], ["Optical manipulation of electronic dimensionality in a quantum material", "Exotic phenomena can be achieved in quantum materials by confining electronic states into two dimensions. For example, relativistic fermions are realized in a single layer of carbon atoms(1), the quantized Hall effect can result from two-dimensional (2D) systems(2,3), and the superconducting transition temperature can be considerably increased in a one-atomic-layer material(4,5). Ordinarily, a 2D electronic system can be obtained by exfoliating the layered materials, growing monolayer materials on substrates, or establishing interfaces between different materials. Here we use femtosecond infrared laser pulsesto invert the periodic lattice distortion sectionally in a three-dimensional (3D) charge density wave material (1T-TiSe2), creating macroscopic domain walls of transient 2D ordered electronic states with unusual properties. The corresponding ultrafast electronic and lattice dynamics are captured by time-resolved and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy(6) and ultrafast electron diffraction at energies of the order of megaelectronvolts(7). Moreover, in the photoinduced 2D domain wall near the surface we identify a phase with enhanced density of states and signatures of potential opening of an energy gap near the Fermi energy. Such optical modulation of atomic motion is an alternative path towards realizing 2D electronic states and will be a useful platform upon which novel phases in quantum materials may be discovered."], ["Colouration by total internal reflection and interference at microscale concave interfaces", "Many physical phenomena create colour: spectrally selective light absorption by pigments and dyes(1,2), material-specific optical dispersion3 and light interference(4-11) in micrometre-scale and nanometre-scale periodic structures(12-17). In addition, scattering, diffraction and interference mechanisms are inherent to spherical droplets(18), which contribute to atmospheric phenomena such as glories, coronas and rainbows(19). Here we describe a previously unrecognized mechanism for creating iridescent structural colour with large angular spectral separation. Light travelling along different trajectories of total internal reflection at a concave optical interface can interfere to generate brilliant patterns of colour. The effect is generated at interfaces with dimensions that are orders of magnitude larger than the wavelength of visible light and is readily observed in systems as simple as water drops condensed on a transparent substrate. We also exploit this phenomenon in complex systems, including multiphase droplets, three-dimensional patterned polymer surfaces and solid microparticles, to create patterns of iridescent colour that are consistent with theoretical predictions. Such controllable structural colouration is straightforward to generate at microscale interfaces, so we expect that the design principles and predictive theory outlined here will be of interest both for fundamental exploration in optics and for application in functional colloidal inks and paints, displays and sensors."], ["Chemical reprogramming of human somatic cells to pluripotent stem cells", "Cellular reprogramming can manipulate the identity of cells to generate the desired cell types(1-3). The use of cell intrinsic components, including oocyte cytoplasm and transcription factors, can enforce somatic cell reprogramming to pluripotent stem cells(4-7). By contrast, chemical stimulation by exposure to small molecules offers an alternative approach that can manipulate cell fate in a simple and highly controllable manner(8-10). However, human somatic cells are refractory to chemical stimulation owing to their stable epigenome(2,11,12) and reduced plasticity(13,14); it is therefore challenging to induce human pluripotent stem cells by chemical reprogramming. Here we demonstrate, by creating an intermediate plastic state, the chemical reprogramming of human somatic cells to human chemically induced pluripotent stem cells that exhibit key features of embryonic stem cells. The whole chemical reprogramming trajectory analysis delineated the induction of the intermediate plastic state at the early stage, during which chemical-induced dedifferentiation occurred, and this process was similar to the dedifferentiation process that occurs in axolotl limb regeneration. Moreover, we identified the JNK pathway as a major barrier to chemical reprogramming, the inhibition of which was indispensable for inducing cell plasticity and a regeneration-like program by suppressing pro-inflammatory pathways. Our chemical approach provides a platform for the generation and application of human pluripotent stem cells in biomedicine.

Simple parametric models have been used to design a wide range of a-helical coiled-coil structures, but to date there has been no success with beta-barrels. Here we show that accurate de novo design of beta-barrels requires considerable symmetry-breaking to achieve continuous hydrogen-bond connectivity and eliminate backbone strain. We then build ensembles of beta-barrel backbone models with cavity shapes that match the fluorogenic compound DFHBI, and use a hierarchical grid-based search method to simultaneously optimize the rigid-body placement of DFHBI in these cavities and the identities of the surrounding amino acids to achieve high shape and chemical complementarity. The designs have high structural accuracy and bind and fluorescently activate DFHBI in vitro and in Escherichia coli, yeast and mammalian cells. This de novo design of small-molecule binding activity, using backbones custom-built to bind the ligand, should enable the design of increasingly sophisticated ligand-binding proteins, sensors and catalysts that are not limited by the backbone geometries available in known protein structures."], ["Stable amorphous georgeite as a precursor to a high-activity catalyst", "Copper and zinc form an important group of hydroxycarbonate minerals that include zincian malachite, aurichalcite, rosasite and the exceptionally rare and unstable- and hence little known and largely ignored(1)-georgeite. The first three of these minerals are widely used as catalyst precursors(2-4) for the industrially important methanol-synthesis and low-temperature water-gas shift (LTS) reactions(5-7), with the choice of precursor phase strongly influencing the activity of the final catalyst. The preferred phase(2,3,8-10) is usually zincian malachite. This is prepared by a co-precipitation method that involves the transient formation of georgeite(11); with few exceptions(12) it uses sodium carbonate as the carbonate source, but this also introduces sodium ions-a potential catalyst poison. Here we show that supercritical antisolvent (SAS) precipitation using carbon dioxide (refs 13, 14), a process that exploits the high diffusion rates and solvation power of supercritical carbon dioxide to rapidly expand and supersaturate solutions, can be used to prepare copper/zinc hydroxycarbonate precursors with low sodium content. These include stable georgeite, which we find to be a precursor to highly active methanol-synthesis and superior LTS catalysts.

Moire lattices have several applications in everyday life, including artistic design, the textile industry, architecture, image processing, metrology and interferometry. For scientific studies, they have been produced using coupled graphene-hexagonal boron nitride monolayers(1,2), graphene-graphene layers(3,4) and graphene quasicrystals on a silicon carbide surface(5). The recent surge of interest in moire lattices arises from the possibility of exploring many salient physical phenomena in such systems; examples include commensurable-incommensurable transitions and topological defects(2), the emergence of insulating states owing to band flattening(3,6), unconventional superconductivity(4) controlled by the rotation angle(7,8), the quantum Hall effect(9), the realization of non-Abelian gauge potentials(10) and the appearance of quasicrystals at special rotation angles(11). A fundamental question that remains unexplored concerns the evolution of waves in the potentials defined by moire lattices. Here we experimentally create two-dimensional photonic moire lattices, which-unlike their material counterparts-have readily controllable parameters and symmetry, allowing us to explore transitions between structures with fundamentally different geometries (periodic, general aperiodic and quasicrystal). We observe localization of light in deterministic linear lattices that is based on flatband physics(6), in contrast to previous schemes based on light diffusion in optical quasicrystals(12), where disorder is required(13) for the onset of Anderson localization(14) (that is, wave localization in random media). Using commensurable and incommensurable moire patterns, we experimentally demonstrate the twodimensional localization-delocalization transition of light. Moire lattices may feature an almost arbitrary geometry that is consistent with the crystallographic symmetry groups of the sublattices, and therefore afford a powerful tool for controlling the properties of light patterns and exploring the physics of periodic-aperiodic phase transitions and two-dimensional wavepacket phenomena relevant to several areas of science, including optics, acoustics, condensed matter and atomic physics."], ["Snapshots of cooperative atomic motions in the optical suppression of charge density waves", "Macroscopic quantum phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity, colossal magnetoresistance, ferrimagnetism and ferromagnetism arise from a delicate balance of different interactions among electrons, phonons and spins on the nanoscale(1). The study of the interplay among these various degrees of freedom in strongly coupled electron-lattice systems is thus crucial to their understanding and for optimizing their properties. Charge-density-wave (CDW) materials(2), with their inherent modulation of the electron density and associated periodic lattice distortion, represent ideal model systems for the study of such highly cooperative phenomena. With femtosecond time-resolved techniques, it is possible to observe these interactions directly by abruptly perturbing the electronic distribution while keeping track of energy relaxation pathways and coupling strengths among the different subsystems(3-7). Numerous time-resolved experiments have been performed on CDWs(8-13), probing the dynamics of the electronic subsystem. However, the dynamics of the periodic lattice distortion have been only indirectly inferred(14). Here we provide direct atomic-level information on the structural dynamics by using femtosecond electron diffraction(15) to study the quasi two-dimensional CDW system 1T-TaS2. Effectively, we have directly observed the atomic motions that result from the optically induced change in the electronic spatial distribution. The periodic lattice distortion, which has an amplitude of similar to 0.1 angstrom, is suppressed by about 20% on a timescale (similar to 250 femtoseconds) comparable to half the period of the corresponding collective mode. These highly cooperative, electronically driven atomic motions are accompanied by a rapid electron-phonon energy transfer (similar to 350 femtoseconds) and are followed by fast recovery of the CDW (similar to 4 picoseconds). The degree of cooperativity in the observed structural dynamics is remarkable and illustrates the importance of obtaining atomic-level perspectives of the processes directing the physics of strongly correlated systems."], ["Simultaneously enhanced tenacity, rupture work, and thermal conductivity of carbon nanotube fibers by raising effective tube portion", "Although individual carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are superior to polymer chains, the mechanical and thermal properties of CNT fibers (CNTFs) remain inferior to synthetic fibers because of the failure of embedding CNTs effectively in superstructures. Conventional techniques resulted in a mild improvement of target properties while degrading others. Here, a double-drawing technique is developed to rearrange the constituent CNTs. Consequently, the mechanical and thermal properties of the resulting CNTFs can simultaneously reach their highest performances with specific strength ~3.30 N tex\u22121 (4.60 GPa), work of rupture ~70 J g\u22121, and thermal conductivity ~354 W m\u22121 K\u22121 despite starting from low-crystallinity materials (IG:ID ~ 5).

To appreciate how imperfections in solids influence thermal conductivity and diffusivity, it is thus essential to understand phonon-defect interactions. Sophisticated theories are available to explore such interactions, but experimental validation is limited because most phonon-detecting spectroscopic methods do not reach the high spatial resolution needed to resolve local vibrational spectra near individual defects. Here we demonstrate that space- and angle-resolved vibrational spectroscopy in a transmission electron microscope makes it possible to map the vibrational spectra of individual crystal defects. We detect a red shift of several millielectronvolts in the energy of acoustic vibration modes near a single stacking fault in cubic silicon carbide, together with substantial changes in their intensity, and find that these changes are confined to within a few nanometres of the stacking fault. These observations illustrate that the capabilities of a state-of-the-art transmission electron microscope open the door to the direct mapping of phonon propagation around defects, which is expected to provide useful guidance for engineering the thermal properties of materials."], ["The <i>Phaeodactylum</i> genome reveals the evolutionary history of diatom genomes", "Diatoms are photosynthetic secondary endosymbionts found throughout marine and freshwater environments, and are believed to be responsible for around one- fifth of the primary productivity on Earth(1,2). The genome sequence of the marine centric diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana was recently reported, revealing a wealth of information about diatom biology(3-5). Here we report the complete genome sequence of the pennate diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum and compare it with that of T. pseudonana to clarify evolutionary origins, functional significance and ubiquity of these features throughout diatoms. In spite of the fact that the pennate and centric lineages have only been diverging for 90 million years, their genome structures are dramatically different and a substantial fraction of genes (similar to 40%) are not shared by these representatives of the two lineages. Analysis of molecular divergence compared with yeasts and metazoans reveals rapid rates of gene diversification in diatoms. Contributing factors include selective gene family expansions, differential losses and gains of genes and introns, and differential mobilization of transposable elements. Most significantly, we document the presence of hundreds of genes from bacteria. More than 300 of these gene transfers are found in both diatoms, attesting to their ancient origins, and many are likely to provide novel possibilities for metabolite management and for perception of environmental signals. These findings go a long way towards explaining the incredible diversity and success of the diatoms in contemporary oceans."], ["Direct observation of ultrafast hydrogen bond strengthening in liquid water", "Water is one of the most important, yet least understood, liquids in nature. Many anomalous properties of liquid water originate from its well-connected hydrogen bond network, including unusually efficient vibrational energy redistribution and relaxation. An accurate description of the ultrafast vibrational motion of water molecules is essential for understanding the nature of hydrogen bonds and many solution-phase chemical reactions. Most existing knowledge of vibrational relaxation in water is built upon ultrafast spectroscopy experiments. However, these experiments cannot directly resolve the motion of the atomic positions and require difficult translation of spectral dynamics into hydrogen bond dynamics. Here, we measure the ultrafast structural response to the excitation of the OH stretching vibration in liquid water with femtosecond temporal and atomic spatial resolution using liquid ultrafast electron scattering. We observed a transient hydrogen bond contraction of roughly 0.04\u2009\u00c5 on a timescale of 80 femtoseconds, followed by a thermalization on a timescale of approximately 1 picosecond. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal the need to treat the distribution of the shared proton in the hydrogen bond quantum mechanically to capture the structural dynamics on femtosecond timescales. Our experiment and simulations unveil the intermolecular character of the water vibration preceding the relaxation of the OH stretch."], ["A Mott insulator of fermionic atoms in an optical lattice", "Strong interactions between electrons in a solid material can lead to surprising properties. A prime example is the Mott insulator, in which suppression of conductivity occurs as a result of interactions rather than a filled Bloch band(1). Proximity to the Mott insulating phase in fermionic systems is the origin of many intriguing phenomena in condensed matter physics(2), most notably high- temperature superconductivity(3). The Hubbard model(4), which encompasses the essential physics of the Mott insulator, also applies to quantum gases trapped in an optical lattice(5,6). It is therefore now possible to access this regime with tools developed in atomic physics. However, an atomic Mott insulator has so far been realized only with a gas of bosons(7), which lack the rich and peculiar nature of fermions. Here we report the formation of a Mott insulator of a repulsively interacting two- component Fermi gas in an optical lattice. It is identified by three features: a drastic suppression of doubly occupied lattice sites, a strong reduction of the compressibility inferred from the response of double occupancy to an increase in atom number, and the appearance of a gapped mode in the excitation spectrum. Direct control of the interaction strength allows us to compare the Mott insulating regime and the non- interacting regime without changing tunnel- coupling or confinement. Our results pave the way for further studies of the Mott insulator, including spin- ordering and ultimately the question of d- wave superfluidity(6,8)."], ["Structural basis for catalysis and substrate specificity of human ACAT1", "The structure of human ACAT1, which catalyses the transfer of an acyl group from acyl-coenzyme A to cholesterol to form cholesteryl ester, is resolved by cryo-electron microscopy. As members of the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) enzyme family, acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferases (ACATs) catalyse the transfer of an acyl group from acyl-coenzyme A to cholesterol to generate cholesteryl ester, the primary form in which cholesterol is stored in cells and transported in plasma(1). ACATs have gained attention as potential drug targets for the treatment of diseases such as atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and cancer(2-7). Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of human ACAT1 as a dimer of dimers. Each protomer consists of nine transmembrane segments, which enclose a cytosolic tunnel and a transmembrane tunnel that converge at the predicted catalytic site. Evidence from structure-guided mutational analyses suggests that acyl-coenzyme A enters the active site through the cytosolic tunnel, whereas cholesterol may enter from the side through the transmembrane tunnel. This structural and biochemical characterization helps to rationalize the preference of ACAT1 for unsaturated acyl chains, and provides insight into the catalytic mechanism of enzymes within the MBOAT family(8)."], ["Accumulation of autophagic vacuoles and cardiomyopathy in LAMP-2-deficient mice", "Lysosome-associated membrane protein-2 (LAMP-2) is a highly glycosylated protein and an important constituent of the lysosomal membrane(1-7). Here we show that LAMP-2 deficiency in mice increases mortality between 20 and 40 days of age. The surviving mice are fertile and have an almost normal life span. Ultrastructurally, there is extensive accumulation of autophagic vacuoles in many tissues including liver, pancreas, spleen, kidney and skeletal and heart muscle. In hepatocytes, the autophagic degradation of long-lived proteins is severely impaired. Cardiac myocytes are ultrastructurally abnormal and heart contractility is severely reduced. These findings indicate that LAMP-2 is critical for autophagy. This theory is further substantiated by the finding that human LAMP-2 deficiency(8) causing Danon's disease is associated with the accumulation of autophagic material in striated myocytes."], ["Synthesis and medical applications of oligosaccharides", "Our understanding of the different glycoconjugates present on cells, proteins and entire organisms is lagging far behind advances in genomics and proteomics. Carbohydrate sequencing and the synthesis of defined oligosaccharides are two key technologies that have contributed to progress in glycomics research. Synthetic tools and high-throughput experiments such as carbohydrate arrays are beginning to affect biological research. These techniques are now being applied to the development of carbohydrate-based diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics."], ["Noxious compounds activate TRPA1 ion channels through covalent modification of cysteines", "The nervous system senses peripheral damage through nociceptive neurons that transmit a pain signal(1,2). TRPA1 is a member of the Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) family of ion channels and is expressed in nociceptive neurons(3-5). TRPA1 is activated by a variety of noxious stimuli, including cold temperatures, pungent natural compounds, and environmental irritants(6-11). How such diverse stimuli activate TRPA1 is not known. We observed that most compounds known to activate TRPA1 are able to covalently bind cysteine residues. Here we use click chemistry to show that derivatives of two such compounds, mustard oil and cinnamaldehyde, covalently bind mouse TRPA1. Structurally unrelated cysteine-modifying agents such as iodoacetamide (IA) and (2-aminoethyl) methanethiosulphonate ( MTSEA) also bind and activate TRPA1. We identified by mass spectrometry fourteen cytosolic TRPA1 cysteines labelled by IA, three of which are required for normal channel function. In excised patches, reactive compounds activated TRPA1 currents that were maintained at least 10 min after washout of the compound in calcium-free solutions. Finally, activation of TRPA1 by disulphide-bond-forming MTSEA is blocked by the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT). Collectively, our data indicate that covalent modification of reactive cysteines within TRPA1 can cause channel activation, rapidly signalling potential tissue damage through the pain pathway."], ["Hydrogen is an energy source for hydrothermal vent symbioses", "The discovery of deep-sea hydrothermal vents in 1977 revolutionized our understanding of the energy sources that fuel primary productivity on Earth. Hydrothermal vent ecosystems are dominated by animals that live in symbiosis with chemosynthetic bacteria. So far, only two energy sources have been shown to power chemosynthetic symbioses: reduced sulphur compounds and methane. Using metagenome sequencing, single-gene fluorescence in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, shipboard incubations and in situ mass spectrometry, we show here that the symbionts of the hydrothermal vent mussel Bathymodiolus from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge use hydrogen to power primary production. In addition, we show that the symbionts of Bathymodiolus mussels from Pacific vents have hupL, the key gene for hydrogen oxidation. Furthermore, the symbionts of other vent animals such as the tubeworm Riftia pachyptila and the shrimp Rimicaris exoculata also have hupL. We propose that the ability to use hydrogen as an energy source is widespread in hydrothermal vent symbioses, particularly at sites where hydrogen is abundant."], ["Functional materials discovery using energy\u2013structure\u2013function maps", "Molecular crystals cannot be designed in the same manner as macroscopic objects, because they do not assemble according to simple, intuitive rules. Their structures result from the balance of many weak interactions, rather than from the strong and predictable bonding patterns found in metal\u2013organic frameworks and covalent organic frameworks. Hence, design strategies that assume a topology or other structural blueprint will often fail. Here we combine computational crystal structure prediction and property prediction to build energy\u2013structure\u2013function maps that describe the possible structures and properties that are available to a candidate molecule. Using these maps, we identify a highly porous solid, which has the lowest density reported for a molecular crystal so far. Both the structure of the crystal and its physical properties, such as methane storage capacity and guest-molecule selectivity, are predicted using the molecular structure as the only input. More generally, energy\u2013structure\u2013function maps could be used to guide the experimental discovery of materials with any target function that can be calculated from predicted crystal structures, such as electronic structure or mechanical properties."], ["Electrochemical Vicinal Difluorination of Alkenes: Scalable and Amenable to Electron-Rich Substrates", "Fluorinated alkyl groups are important motifs in bioactive compounds, positively influencing pharmacokinetics, potency and conformation. The oxidative difluorination of alkenes represents an important strategy for their preparation, yet current methods are limited in their alkene-types and tolerance of electron-rich, readily oxidized functionalities, as well as in their safety and scalability. Herein, we report a method for the difluorination of a number of unactivated alkene-types that is tolerant of electron-rich functionality, giving products that are otherwise unattainable. Key to success is the electrochemical generation of a hypervalent iodine mediator using an \u201cex-cell\u201d approach, which avoids oxidative substrate decomposition. The more sustainable conditions give good to excellent yields in up to decagram scales."], ["Exciton-polariton topological insulator", "Topological insulators-materials that are insulating in the bulk but allow electrons to flow on their surface-are striking examples of materials in which topological invariants are manifested in robustness against perturbations such as defects and disorder(1). Their most prominent feature is the emergence of edge states at the boundary between areas with different topological properties. The observable physical effect is unidirectional robust transport of these edge states. Topological insulators were originally observed in the integer quantum Hall effect(2) (in which conductance is quantized in a strong magnetic field) and subsequently suggested(3-5) and observed(6) to exist without a magnetic field, by virtue of other effects such as strong spin-orbit interaction. These were systems of correlated electrons. During the past decade, the concepts of topological physics have been introduced into other fields, including microwaves(7,8), photonic systems(9,10), cold atoms(11,12), acoustics(13,14) and even mechanics(15). Recently, topological insulators were suggested to be possible in exciton-polariton systems(16-18) organized as honeycomb (graphene-like) lattices, under the influence of a magnetic field. Exciton-polaritons are part-light, part-matter quasiparticles that emerge from strong coupling of quantum-well excitons and cavity photons(19). Accordingly, the predicted topological effects differ from all those demonstrated thus far. Here we demonstrate experimentally an exciton-polariton topological insulator. Our lattice of coupled semiconductor microcavities is excited non-resonantly by a laser, and an applied magnetic field leads to the unidirectional flow of a polariton wavepacket around the edge of the array. This chiral edge mode is populated by a polariton condensation mechanism. We use scanning imaging techniques in real space and Fourier space to measure photoluminescence and thus visualize the mode as it propagates. We demonstrate that the topological edge mode goes around defects, and that its propagation direction can be reversed by inverting the applied magnetic field. Our exciton-polariton topological insulator paves the way for topological phenomena that involve light-matter interaction, amplification and the interaction of exciton-polaritons as a nonlinear many-body system."], ["Eight glacial cycles from an Antarctic ice core", "The Antarctic Vostok ice core provided compelling evidence of the nature of climate, and of climate feedbacks, over the past 420,000 years. Marine records suggest that the amplitude of climate variability was smaller before that time, but such records are often poorly resolved. Moreover, it is not possible to infer the abundance of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from marine records. Here we report the recovery of a deep ice core from Dome C, Antarctica, that provides a climate record for the past 740,000 years. For the four most recent glacial cycles, the data agree well with the record from Vostok. The earlier period, between 740,000 and 430,000 years ago, was characterized by less pronounced warmth in interglacial periods in Antarctica, but a higher proportion of each cycle was spent in the warm mode. The transition from glacial to interglacial conditions about 430,000 years ago ( Termination V) resembles the transition into the present interglacial period in terms of the magnitude of change in temperatures and greenhouse gases, but there are significant differences in the patterns of change. The interglacial stage following Termination V was exceptionally long - 28,000 years compared to, for example, the 12,000 years recorded so far in the present interglacial period. Given the similarities between this earlier warm period and today, our results may imply that without human intervention, a climate similar to the present one would extend well into the future."], ["Perpendicular full switching of chiral antiferromagnetic order by current", "Electrical control of a magnetic state of matter lays the foundation for information technologies and for understanding of spintronic phenomena. Spin-orbit torque provides an efficient mechanism for the electrical manipulation of magnetic orders(1-11). In particular, spin-orbit torque switching of perpendicular magnetization in nanoscale ferromagnetic bits has enabled the development of stable, reliable and low-power memories and computation(12-14). Likewise, for antiferromagnetic spintronics, electrical bidirectional switching of an antiferromagnetic order in a perpendicular geometry may have huge impacts, given its potential advantage for high-density integration and ultrafast operation(15,16). Here we report the experimental realization of perpendicular and full spin-orbit torque switching of an antiferromagnetic binary state. We use the chiral antiferromagnet Mn3Sn (ref. (17)), which exhibits the magnetization-free anomalous Hall effect owing to a ferroic order of a cluster magnetic octupole hosted in its chiral antiferromagnetic state(18). We fabricate heavy-metal/Mn3Sn heterostructures by molecular beam epitaxy and introduce perpendicular magnetic anisotropy of the octupole using an epitaxial in-plane tensile strain. By using the anomalous Hall effect as the readout, we demonstrate 100 per cent switching of the perpendicular octupole polarization in a 30-nanometre-thick Mn3Sn film with a small critical current density of less than 15 megaamperes per square centimetre. Our theory reveals that the perpendicular geometry between the polarization directions of current-induced spin accumulation and of the octupole persistently maximizes the spin-orbit torque efficiency during the deterministic bidirectional switching process. Our work provides a significant basis for antiferromagnetic spintronics."], ["Face-to-face transfer of wafer-scale graphene films", "Graphene has attracted worldwide interest since its experimental discovery(1,2), but the preparation of large-area, continuous graphene film on SiO2/Si wafers, free from growth-related morphological defects or transfer-induced cracks and folds, remains a formidable challenge(3). Growth of graphene by chemical vapour deposition on Cu foils(4-7) has emerged as a powerful technique owing to its compatibility with industrial-scale roll-to-roll technology(6). However, the polycrystalline nature and microscopic roughness of Cu foils means that such roll-to-roll transferred films are not devoid of cracks and folds(6,7). High-fidelity transfer or direct growth of high-quality graphene films on arbitrary substrates is needed to enable wide-ranging applications in photonics or electronics, which include devices such as optoelectronic modulators, transistors, on-chip biosensors and tunnelling barriers(3,8,9). The direct growth of graphene film on an insulating substrate, such as a SiO2/Si wafer, would be useful for this purpose, but current research efforts remain grounded at the proof-of-concept stage, where only discontinuous, nanometre-sized islands can be obtained(10). Here we develop a face-to-face transfer method for wafer-scale graphene films that is so far the only known way to accomplish both the growth and transfer steps on one wafer. This spontaneous transfer method relies on nascent gas bubbles and capillary bridges between the graphene film and the underlying substrate during etching of the metal catalyst, which is analogous to the method used by tree frogs to remain attached to submerged leaves(11,12). In contrast to the previous wet(4,5,13-15) or dry(6,7) transfer results, the face-to-face transfer does not have to be done by hand and is compatible with any size and shape of substrate; this approach also enjoys the benefit of a much reduced density of transfer defects compared with the conventional transfer method. Most importantly, the direct growth and spontaneous attachment of graphene on the underlying substrate is amenable to batch processing in a semiconductor production line, and thus will speed up the technological application of graphene."], ["Spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates", "Spin-orbit (SO) coupling-the interaction between a quantum particle's spin and its momentum-is ubiquitous in physical systems. In condensed matter systems, SO coupling is crucial for the spin-Hall effect(1,2) and topological insulators(3-5); it contributes to the electronic properties of materials such as GaAs, and is important for spintronic devices(6). Quantum many-body systems of ultracold atoms can be precisely controlled experimentally, and would therefore seem to provide an ideal platform on which to study SO coupling. Although an atom's intrinsic SO coupling affects its electronic structure, it does not lead to coupling between the spin and the centre-of-mass motion of the atom. Here, we engineer SO coupling (with equal Rashba(7) and Dresselhaus(8) strengths) in a neutral atomic Bose-Einstein condensate by dressing two atomic spin states with a pair of lasers(9). Such coupling has not been realized previously for ultracold atomic gases, or indeed any bosonic system. Furthermore, in the presence of the laser coupling, the interactions between the two dressed atomic spin states are modified, driving a quantum phase transition from a spatially spin-mixed state (lasers off) to a phase-separated state (above a critical laser intensity). We develop a many-body theory that provides quantitative agreement with the observed location of the transition.

Several important applications are currently emerging from quantum technology and especially from electrical circuits that behave quantum mechanically, that is, circuit quantum electrodynamics(6). This field has given rise to single-photon microwave detectors(7-9)and a quantum computer that is superior to classical supercomputers for certain tasks(10). Thermal sensors hold potential for enhancing such devices because they do not add quantum noise and they are smaller, simpler and consume about six orders of magnitude less power than the frequently used travelling-wave parametric amplifiers(11). However, despite great progress in the speed(12)and noise levels(13)of thermal sensors, no bolometer has previously met the threshold for circuit quantum electrodynamics, which lies at a time constant of a few hundred nanoseconds and a simultaneous energy resolution of the order of 10hgigahertz (where his the Planck constant). Here we experimentally demonstrate a bolometer that operates at this threshold, with a noise-equivalent power of 30 zeptowatts per square-root hertz, comparable to the lowest value reported so far(13), at a thermal time constant two orders of magnitude shorter, at 500 nanoseconds. Both of these values are measured directly on the same device, giving an accurate estimation of 30h gigahertz for the calorimetric energy resolution. These improvements stem from the use of a graphene monolayer with extremely low specific heat(14)as the active material. The minimum observed time constant of 200 nanoseconds is well below the dephasing times of roughly 100 microseconds reported for superconducting qubits(15)and matches the timescales of currently used readout schemes(16,17), thus enabling circuit quantum electrodynamics applications for bolometers."], ["An <i>N</i>-nitrosating metalloenzyme constructs the pharmacophore of streptozotocin", "Small molecules containing the N-nitroso group, such as the bacterial natural product streptozotocin, are prominent carcinogens(1,2) and important cancer chemotherapeutics(3,4). Despite the considerable importance of this functional group to human health, enzymes dedicated to the assembly of the N-nitroso unit have not been identified. Here we show that SznF, a metalloenzyme from the biosynthesis of streptozotocin, catalyses an oxidative rearrangement of the guanidine group of N.-methyl-l-arginine to generate an N-nitrosourea product. Structural characterization and mutagenesis of SznF reveal two separate active sites that promote distinct steps in this transformation using different iron-containing metallocofactors. This biosynthetic reaction, which has little precedent in enzymology or organic synthesis, expands the catalytic capabilities of non-haem-iron-dependent enzymes to include N-N bond formation. We find that biosynthetic gene clusters that encode SznF homologues are widely distributed among bacteria-including environmental organisms, plant symbionts and human pathogenswhich suggests an unexpectedly diverse and uncharacterized microbial reservoir of bioactive N-nitroso metabolites."], ["Heterointerface effects in the electrointercalation of van der Waals heterostructures", "Molecular-scale manipulation of electronic and ionic charge accumulation in materials is the backbone of electrochemical energy storagel(1-4). Layered van der Waals (vdW) crystals are a diverse family of materials into which mobile ions can electrochemically intercalate into the interlamellar gaps of the host atomic lattice(5,6). The structural diversity of such materials enables the interfacial properties of composites to be optimized to improve ion intercalation for energy storage and electronic devices(7-12). However, the ability of heterolayers to modify intercalation reactions, and their role at the atomic level, are yet to be elucidated. Here we demonstrate the electrointercalation of lithium at the level of individual atomic interfaces of dissimilar vdW layers. Electrochemical devices based on vdW heterostructures(13) of stacked hexagonal boron nitride, graphene and molybdenum dichalcogenide (MoX2;X=S, Se) layers are constructed. We use transmission electron microscopy, in situ magnetoresistance and optical spectroscopy techniques, as well as low-temperature quantum magneto-oscillation measurements and ab initio calculations, to resolve the intermediate stages of lithium intercalation at heterointerfaces. The formation of vdW heterointerfaces between graphene and MoX2 results in a more than tenfold greater accumulation of charge in MoX2 when compared to MoX2/MoX2 homointerfaces, while enforcing a more negative intercalation potential than that of bulk MoX2 by at least 0.5 V.

Ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic form of cell death marked by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation(1), has a key role in organ injury, degenerative disease and vulnerability of therapy-resistant cancers(2). Although substantial progress has been made in understanding the molecular processes relevant to ferroptosis, additional cell-extrinsic and cell-intrinsic processes that determine cell sensitivity toward ferroptosis remain unknown. Here we show that the fully reduced forms of vitamin K-a group of naphthoquinones that includes menaquinone and phylloquinone(3)-confer a strong anti-ferroptotic function, in addition to the conventional function linked to blood clotting by acting as a cofactor for gamma-glutamyl carboxylase. Ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1), a NAD(P)H-ubiquinone reductase and the second mainstay of ferroptosis control after glutathione peroxidase-4(4,5), was found to efficiently reduce vitamin K to its hydroquinone, a potent radical-trapping antioxidant and inhibitor of (phospho)lipid peroxidation. The FSP1-mediated reduction of vitamin K was also responsible for the antidotal effect of vitamin K against warfarin poisoning. It follows that FSP1 is the enzyme mediating warfarin-resistant vitamin K reduction in the canonical vitamin K cycle(6). The FSP1-dependent non-canonical vitamin K cycle can act to protect cells against detrimental lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis."], ["BICYCLE-PEDAL MODEL FOR 1ST STEP IN VISION PROCESS", "Computer simulation of the molecular dynamics of retinal during its photoisomerization inside a restrictive active site gave a detailed model for the sequence of events in the 1st step of the vision process.

At the intermediate scale of kilobases to megabases, which encompasses the sizes of genes, gene clusters and regulatory domains, the three-dimensional (3D) organization of DNA is implicated in multiple gene regulatory mechanisms(2-4,6-8), but understanding this organization remains a challenge. At this scale, the genome is partitioned into domains of different epigenetic states that are essential for regulating gene expression(9-11). Here we investigate the 3D organization of chromatin in different epigenetic states using super-resolution imaging. We classified genomic domains in Drosophila cells into transcriptionally active, inactive or Polycomb-repressed states, and observed distinct chromatin organizations for each state. All three types of chromatin domains exhibit power-law scaling between their physical sizes in 3D and their domain lengths, but each type has a distinct scaling exponent. Polycomb-repressed domains show the densest packing and most intriguing chromatin folding behaviour, in which chromatin packing density increases with domain length. Distinct from the self-similar organization displayed by transcriptionally active and inactive chromatin, the Polycomb-repressed domains are characterized by a high degree of chromatin intermixing within the domain. Moreover, compared to inactive domains, Polycomb-repressed domains spatially exclude neighbouring active chromatin to a much stronger degree. Computational modelling and knockdown experiments suggest that reversible chromatin interactions mediated by Polycomb-group proteins play an important role in these unique packaging properties of the repressed chromatin. Taken together, our super-resolution images reveal distinct chromatin packaging for different epigenetic states at the kilobase-to-megabase scale, a length scale that is directly relevant to genome regulation."], ["Tunable nanowire nonlinear optical probe", "One crucial challenge for subwavelength optics has been the development of a tunable source of coherent laser radiation for use in the physical, information and biological sciences that is stable at room temperature and physiological conditions. Current advanced near-field imaging techniques using fibre-optic scattering probes(1,2) have already achieved spatial resolution down to the 20-nm range. Recently reported far-field approaches for optical microscopy, including stimulated emission depletion(3), structured illumination(4), and photoactivated localization microscopy(5), have enabled impressive, theoretically unlimited spatial resolution of fluorescent bio-molecular complexes. Previous work with laser tweezers(6-8) has suggested that optical traps could be used to create novel spatial probes and sensors. Inorganic nanowires have diameters substantially below the wavelength of visible light and have electronic and optical properties(9,10) that make them ideal for subwavelength laser and imaging technology. Here we report the development of an electrode-free, continuously tunable coherent visible light source compatible with physiological environments, from individual potassium niobate (KNbO3) nanowires. These wires exhibit efficient second harmonic generation, and act as frequency converters, allowing the local synthesis of a wide range of colours via sum and difference frequency generation. We use this tunable nanometric light source to implement a novel form of subwavelength microscopy, in which an infrared laser is used to optically trap and scan a nanowire over a sample, suggesting a wide range of potential applications in physics, chemistry, materials science and biology."], ["Measuring DNA mechanics on the genome scale", "Mechanical deformations of DNA such as bending are ubiquitous and have been implicated in diverse cellular functions(1). However, the lack of high-throughput tools to measure the mechanical properties of DNA has limited our understanding of how DNA mechanics influence chromatin transactions across the genome. Here we develop 'loop-seq'-a high-throughput assay to measure the propensity for DNA looping-and determine the intrinsic cyclizabilities of 270,806 50-base-pair DNA fragments that span Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome V, other genomic regions, and random sequences. We found sequence-encoded regions of unusually low bendability within nucleosome-depleted regions upstream of transcription start sites (TSSs). Low bendability of linker DNA inhibits nucleosome sliding into the linker by the chromatin remodeller INO80, which explains how INO80 can define nucleosome-depleted regions in the absence of other factors(2). Chromosome-wide, nucleosomes were characterized by high DNA bendability near dyads and low bendability near linkers. This contrast increases for deeper gene-body nucleosomes but disappears after random substitution of synonymous codons, which suggests that the evolution of codon choice has been influenced by DNA mechanics around gene-body nucleosomes. Furthermore, we show that local DNA mechanics affect transcription through TSS-proximal nucleosomes. Overall, this genome-scale map of DNA mechanics indicates a 'mechanical code' with broad functional implications. A high-throughput, chromosome-wide analysis of DNA looping reveals its contribution to the organization of chromatin, and provides insight into how nucleosomes are deposited and organised de novo."], ["Cooperative electrocatalytic alcohol oxidation with electron-proton-transfer mediators", "The electrochemical oxidation of alcohols is a major focus of energy and chemical conversion efforts, with potential applications ranging from fuel cells to biomass utilization and fine-chemical synthesis(1-7). Small-molecule electrocatalysts for processes of this type are promising targets for further development(8), as demonstrated by recent advances in nickel catalysts for electrochemical production and oxidation of hydrogen(9-11). Complexes with tethered amines that resemble the active site of hydrogenases(12) have been shown both to catalyse hydrogen production (from protons and electrons) with rates far exceeding those of such enzymes(11,13) and to mediate reversible electrocatalytic hydrogen production and oxidation with enzyme-like performance(14). Progress in electrocatalytic alcohol oxidation has been more modest. Nickel complexes similar to those used for hydrogen oxidation have been shown to mediate efficient electrochemical oxidation of benzyl alcohol, with a turnover frequency of 2.1 per second. These compounds exhibit poor reactivity with ethanol and methanol, however(15). Organic nitroxyls, such as TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidine N-oxyl), are the most widely studied electrocatalysts for alcohol oxidation(5-7,16-19). These catalysts exhibit good activity (1-2 turnovers per second) with a wide range of alcohols(18) and have great promise for electro-organic synthesis(7). Their use in energy-conversion applications, however, is limited by the high electrode potentials required to generate the reactive oxoammonium species. Here we report (2,2'-bipyridine) Cu/nitroxyl co-catalyst systems for electrochemical alcohol oxidation that proceed with much faster rates, while operating at an electrode potential a half-volt lower than that used for the TEMPO-only process. The (2,2'-bipyridine) Cu(II) and TEMPO redox partners exhibit cooperative reactivity and exploit the low-potential, proton-coupled TEMPO/TEMPOH redox process rather than the high-potential TEMPO/TEMPO+ process. The results show how electron-proton-transfer mediators, such as TEMPO, may be used in combination with first-row transition metals, such as copper, to achieve efficient two-electron electrochemical processes, thereby introducing a new concept for the development of non-precious-metal electrocatalysts."], ["An ultra-stable gold-coordinated protein cage displaying reversible assembly", "Symmetrical protein cages have evolved to fulfil diverse roles in nature, including compartmentalization and cargo delivery(1), and have inspired synthetic biologists to create novel protein assemblies via the precise manipulation of protein-protein interfaces. Despite the impressive array of protein cages produced in the laboratory, the design of inducible assemblies remains challenging(2,3). Here we demonstrate an ultra-stable artificial protein cage, the assembly and disassembly of which can be controlled by metal coordination at the protein-protein interfaces. The addition of a gold (i)-triphenylphosphine compound to a cysteine-substituted, 11-mer protein ring triggers supramolecular self-assembly, which generates monodisperse cage structures with masses greater than 2 MDa. The geometry of these structures is based on the Archimedean snub cube and is, to our knowledge, unprecedented. Cryo-electron microscopy confirms that the assemblies are held together by 120 S-Aui-S staples between the protein oligomers, and exist in two chiral forms. The cage shows extreme chemical and thermal stability, yet it readily disassembles upon exposure to reducing agents. As well as gold, mercury(ii) is also found to enable formation of the protein cage. This work establishes an approach for linking protein components into robust, higher-order structures, and expands the design space available for supramolecular assemblies to include previously unexplored geometries."], ["Quantum tunnelling of the magnetization in a monolayer of oriented single-molecule magnets", "A fundamental step towards atomic- or molecular-scale spintronic devices has recently been made by demonstrating that the spin of an individual atom deposited on a surface(1), or of a small paramagnetic molecule embedded in a nanojunction(2), can be externally controlled. An appealing next step is the extension of such a capability to the field of information storage, by taking advantage of the magnetic bistability and rich quantum behaviour of single-molecule magnets(3-6) (SMMs). Recently, a proof of concept that the magnetic memory effect is retained when SMMs are chemically anchored to a metallic surface(7) was provided. However, control of the nanoscale organization of these complex systems is required for SMMs to be integrated into molecular spintronic devices(8,9). Here we show that a preferential orientation of Fe(4) complexes on a gold surface can be achieved by chemical tailoring. As a result, the most striking quantum feature of SMMs-their stepped hysteresis loop, which results from resonant quantum tunnelling of the magnetization(5,6)-can be clearly detected using synchrotron-based spectroscopic techniques. With the aid of multiple theoretical approaches, we relate the angular dependence of the quantum tunnelling resonances to the adsorption geometry, and demonstrate that molecules predominantly lie with their easy axes close to the surface normal. Our findings prove that the quantum spin dynamics can be observed in SMMs chemically grafted to surfaces, and offer a tool to reveal the organization of matter at the nanoscale."], ["Crystal structure of the human \u03c31 receptor", "The human sigma 1 receptor is an enigmatic endoplasmic-reticulumresident transmembrane protein implicated in a variety of disorders including depression, drug addiction, and neuropathic pain(1). Recently, an additional connection to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis has emerged from studies of human genetics and mouse models(2). Unlike many transmembrane receptors that belong to large, extensively studied families such as G-protein- coupled receptors or ligand-gated ion channels, the sigma 1 receptor is an evolutionary isolate with no discernible similarity to any other human protein. Despite its increasingly clear importance in human physiology and disease, the molecular architecture of the s1 receptor and its regulation by drug-like compounds remain poorly defined. Here we report crystal structures of the human sigma 1 receptor in complex with two chemically divergent ligands, PD144418 and 4-IBP. The structures reveal a trimeric architecture with a single transmembrane domain in each protomer. The carboxy-terminal domain of the receptor shows an extensive flat, hydrophobic membrane-proximal surface, suggesting an intimate association with the cytosolic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane in cells. This domain includes a cupin-like beta-barrel with the ligand-binding site buried at its centre. This large, hydrophobic ligand-binding cavity shows remarkable plasticity in ligand recognition, binding the two ligands in similar positions despite dissimilar chemical structures. Taken together, these results reveal the overall architecture, oligomerization state, and molecular basis for ligand recognition by this important but poorly understood protein."], ["Atomic structures of amyloid cross-\u03b2 spines reveal varied steric zippers", "Amyloid fibrils formed from different proteins, each associated with a particular disease, contain a common cross-beta spine. The atomic architecture of a spine, from the fibril-forming segment GNNQQNY of the yeast prion protein Sup35, was recently revealed by X-ray microcrystallography. It is a pair of beta-sheets, with the facing side chains of the two sheets interdigitated in a dry 'steric zipper'. Here we report some 30 other segments from fibril-forming proteins that form amyloid-like fibrils, microcrystals, or usually both. These include segments from the Alzheimer's amyloid-beta and tau proteins, the PrP prion protein, insulin, islet amyloid polypeptide ( IAPP), lysozyme, myoglobin, alpha-synuclein and beta(2)-microglobulin, suggesting that common structural features are shared by amyloid diseases at the molecular level. Structures of 13 of these microcrystals all reveal steric zippers, but with variations that expand the range of atomic architectures for amyloid-like fibrils and offer an atomic-level hypothesis for the basis of prion strains."], ["Chirality-specific growth of single-walled carbon nanotubes on solid alloy catalysts", "Carbon nanotubes have many material properties that make them attractive for applications(1,2). In the context of nanoelectronics(3), interest has focused on single-walled carbon nanotubes(4) (SWNTs) because slight changes in tube diameter and wrapping angle, defined by the chirality indices (n,m), will shift their electrical conductivity from one characteristic of a metallic state to one characteristic of a semiconducting state, and will also change the bandgap. However, this structure-function relationship can be fully exploited only with structurally pure SWNTs. Solution-based separation methods(5) yield tubes within a narrow structure range, but the ultimate goal of producing just one type of SWNT by controlling its structure during growth has proved to be a considerable challenge over the last two decades(6-9). Such efforts aim to optimize the composition(6,10-17) or shape(18-21) of the catalyst particles that are used in the chemical vapour deposition synthesis process to decompose the carbon feedstock and influence SWNT nucleation and growth(22-25). This approach resulted in the highest reported proportion, 55 per cent, of single-chirality SWNTs in an as-grown sample(11). Here we show that SWNTs of a single chirality, (12, 6), can be produced directly with an abundance higher than 92 per cent when using tungsten-based bimetallic alloy nanocrystals as catalysts. These, unlike other catalysts used so far, have such high melting points that they maintain their crystalline structure during the chemical vapour deposition process. This feature seems crucial because experiment and simulation both suggest that the highly selective growth of (12, 6) SWNTs is the result of a good structural match between the carbon atom arrangement around the nanotube circumference and the arrangement of the catalytically active atoms in one of the planes of the nanocrystal catalyst. We anticipate that using high-melting-point alloy nanocrystals with optimized structures as catalysts paves the way for total chirality control in SWNT growth and will thus promote the development of SWNT applications."], ["A MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASE EXPRESSED ON THE SURFACE OF INVASIVE TUMOR-CELLS", "GELATINASE A (type-IV collagenase; M(r) 72,000) is produced by tumour stroma cells and is believed to be crucial for their invasion and metastasis, acting by degrading extracellular matrix macromolecules such as type IV collagen(1-3). An inactive precursor of gelatinase A (pro-gelatinase A) is secreted and activated in invasive tumour tissue(4-7) as a result of proteolysis which is mediated by a fraction of tumour cell membrane that is sensitive to metalloproteinase inhibitors(4,5). Here we report the cloning of the complementary DNA encoding a new matrix metalloproteinase with a potential transmembrane domain. Expression of the gene product on the cell surface induces specific activation of pro-gelatinase A in vitro and enhances cellular invasion of the reconstituted basement membrane. Tumour cells of invasive lung carcinomas, which contain activated forms of gelatinase A, were found to express the transcript and the gene product. The new metalloproteinase may thus trigger invasion by tumour cells by activating pro-gelatinase A on the tumour cell surface."], ["Design, fabrication and control of soft robots", "Conventionally, engineers have employed rigid materials to fabricate precise, predictable robotic systems, which are easily modelled as rigid members connected at discrete joints. Natural systems, however, often match or exceed the performance of robotic systems with deformable bodies. Cephalopods, for example, achieve amazing feats of manipulation and locomotion without a skeleton; even vertebrates such as humans achieve dynamic gaits by storing elastic energy in their compliant bones and soft tissues. Inspired by nature, engineers have begun to explore the design and control of soft-bodied robots composed of compliant materials. This Review discusses recent developments in the emerging field of soft robotics."], ["Fluorescence intermittency in single cadmium selenide nanocrystals", "SEMICONDUCTOR nanocrystals offer the opportunity to study the evolution of hulk materials properties as the size of a system increases from the molecular scale(1,2). In addition, their strongly size-dependent optical properties render them attractive candidates as tunable light absorbers and emitters in optoelectronic devices such as light-emitting diodes(3,4) and quantum-dot lasers(5,6), and as optical probes of biological systems(7). Here we show that light emission from single fluorescing nanocrystals of cadmium selenide under continuous excitation turns on and off intermittently with a characteristic timescale of about 0.5 seconds. This intermittency is not apparent from ensemble measurements on many nanocrystals. The dependence on excitation intensity and the change in on/off times when a passivating, high-bandgap shell of zinc sulphide encapsulates the nanocrystal(8,9) suggests that the abrupt turning off of luminescence is caused by photoionization of the nanocrystal. Thus spectroscopic measurements on single nanocrystals can reveal hitherto unknown aspects of their photophysics."], ["Heterogeneous integration of single-crystalline complex-oxide membranes", "Complex-oxide materials exhibit a vast range of functional properties desirable for next-generation electronic, spintronic, magnetoelectric, neuromorphic, and energy conversion storage devices(1-4). Their physical functionalities can be coupled by stacking layers of such materials to create heterostructures and can be further boosted by applying strain(5-7). The predominant method for heterogeneous integration and application of strain has been through heteroepitaxy, which drastically limits the possible material combinations and the ability to integrate complex oxides with mature semiconductor technologies. Moreover, key physical properties of complex-oxide thin films, such as piezoelectricity and magnetostriction, are severely reduced by the substrate clamping effect. Here we demonstrate a universal mechanical exfoliation method of producing freestanding single-crystalline membranes made from a wide range of complex-oxide materials including perovskite, spinel and garnet crystal structures with varying crystallographic orientations. In addition, we create artificial heterostructures and hybridize their physical properties by directly stacking such freestanding membranes with different crystal structures and orientations, which is not possible using conventional methods. Our results establish a platform for stacking and coupling three-dimensional structures, akin to two-dimensional material-based heterostructures, for enhancing device functionalities(8,9)."], ["Enantiomer-dependent immunological response to chiral nanoparticles", "Chirality is a unifying structural metric of biological and abiological forms of matter. Over the past decade, considerable clarity has been achieved in understanding the chemistry and physics of chiral inorganic nanoparticles(1-4); however, little is known about their effects on complex biochemical networks(5,6). Intermolecular interactions of biological molecules and inorganic nanoparticles show some commonalities(7-9), but these structures differ in scale, in geometry and in the dynamics of chiral shapes, which can both impede and strengthen their mirror-asymmetric complexes. Here we show that achiral and left- and right-handed gold biomimetic nanoparticles show different in vitro and in vivo immune responses. We use irradiation with circularly polarized light (CPL) to synthesize nanoparticles with controllable nanometre-scale chirality and optical anisotropy factors (g-factors) of up to 0.4. We find that binding of nanoparticles to two proteins from the family of adhesion G-protein-coupled receptors (AGPCRs)-namely cluster-of-differentiation 97 (CD97) and epidermal-growth-factor-like-module receptor 1 (EMR1)-results in the opening of mechanosensitive potassium-efflux channels, the production of immune signalling complexes known as inflammasomes, and the maturation of mouse bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells. Both in vivo and in vitro immune responses depend monotonically on the g-factors of the nanoparticles, indicating that nanoscale chirality can be used to regulate the maturation of immune cells. Finally, left-handed nanoparticles show substantially higher (1,258-fold) efficiency compared with their right-handed counterparts as adjuvants for vaccination against the H9N2 influenza virus, opening a path to the use of nanoscale chirality in immunology."], ["A III-V nanowire channel on silicon for high-performance vertical transistors", "Silicon transistors are expected to have new gate architectures, channel materials and switching mechanisms in ten years' time(1-4). The trend in transistor scaling has already led to a change in gate structure from two dimensions to three, used in fin field-effect transistors, to avoid problems inherent in miniaturization such as high off-state leakage current and the short-channel effect. At present, planar and fin architectures using III-V materials, specifically InGaAs, are being explored as alternative fast channels on silicon(5-9) because of their high electron mobility and high-quality interface with gate dielectrics(10). The idea of surrounding-gate transistors(11), in which the gate is wrapped around a nanowire channel to provide the best possible electrostatic gate control, using InGaAs channels on silicon, however, has been less well investigated(12,13) because of difficulties in integrating free-standing InGaAs nanostructures on silicon. Here we report the position-controlled growth of vertical InGaAs nanowires on silicon without any buffering technique and demonstrate surrounding-gate transistors using InGaAs nanowires and InGaAs/InP/InAlAs/InGaAs core-multishell nanowires as channels. Surrounding-gate transistors using core-multishell nanowire channels with a six-sided, high-electron-mobility transistor structure greatly enhance the on-state current and transconductance while keeping good gate controllability. These devices provide a route to making vertically oriented transistors for the next generation of field-effect transistors and may be useful as building blocks for wireless networks on silicon platforms."], ["Light-induced shape-memory polymers", "Materials are said to show a shape-memory effect if they can be deformed and fixed into a temporary shape, and recover their original, permanent shape only on exposure to an external stimulus(1-3). Shape-memory polymers have received increasing attention because of their scientific and technological significance(4,5). In principle, a thermally induced shape-memory effect can be activated by an increase in temperature ( also obtained by heating on exposure to an electrical current(6) or light illumination(6,7)). Several papers have described light-induced changes in the shape of polymers(8-12) and gels(13-15), such as contraction(8-10), bending(11-13) or volume changes(14,15). Here we report that polymers containing cinnamic groups can be deformed and fixed into predetermined shapes - such as ( but not exclusively) elongated films and tubes, arches or spirals - by ultraviolet light illumination. These new shapes are stable for long time periods, even when heated to 50 degrees C, and they can recover their original shape at ambient temperatures when exposed to ultraviolet light of a different wavelength. The ability of polymers to form different pre-determined temporary shapes and subsequently recover their original shape at ambient temperatures by remote light activation could lead to a variety of potential medical and other applications."], ["Hierarchically structured diamond composite with exceptional toughness", "The well known trade-off between hardness and toughness (resistance to fracture) makes simultaneous improvement of both properties challenging, especially in diamond. The hardness of diamond can be increased through nanostructuring strategies(1,2), among which the formation of high-density nanoscale twins - crystalline regions related by symmetry - also toughens diamond(2). In materials other than diamond, there are several other promising approaches to enhancing toughness in addition to nanotwinning(3), such as bio-inspired laminated composite toughening(4-7), transformation toughening(8) and dual-phase toughening9, but there has been little research into such approaches in diamond. Here we report the structural characterization of a diamond composite hierarchically assembled with coherently interfaced diamond polytypes (different stacking sequences), interwoven nanotwins and interlocked nanograins. The architecture of the composite enhances toughness more than nanotwinning alone, without sacrificing hardness. Single-edge notched beam tests yield a toughness up to five times that of synthetic diamond(10), even greater than that of magnesium alloys. When fracture occurs, a crack propagates through diamond nanotwins of the 3C (cubic) polytype along {111} planes, via a zigzag path. As the crack encounters regions of non-3C polytypes, its propagation is diffused into sinuous fractures, with local transformation into 3C diamond near the fracture surfaces. Both processes dissipate strain energy, thereby enhancing toughness. This work could prove useful in making superhard materials and engineering ceramics. By using structural architecture with synergetic effects of hardening and toughening, the trade-off between hardness and toughness may eventually be surmounted."], ["Topological surface states protected from backscattering by chiral spin texture", "Topological insulators are a new class of insulators in which a bulk gap for electronic excitations is generated because of the strong spin-orbit coupling(1-5) inherent to these systems. These materials are distinguished from ordinary insulators by the presence of gapless metallic surface states, resembling chiral edge modes in quantum Hall systems, but with unconventional spin textures. A key predicted feature of such spin-textured boundary states is their insensitivity to spin-independent scattering, which is thought to protect them from backscattering and localization. Recently, experimental and theoretical efforts have provided strong evidence for the existence of both two-and three-dimensional classes of such topological insulator materials in semiconductor quantum well structures(6-8) and several bismuth-based compounds(9-13), but so far experiments have not probed the sensitivity of these chiral states to scattering. Here we use scanning tunnelling spectroscopy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to visualize the gapless surface states in the three-dimensional topological insulator Bi1-xSbx, and examine in detail the influence of scattering from disorder caused by random alloying in this compound. We show that, despite strong atomic scale disorder, backscattering between states of opposite momentum and opposite spin is absent. Our observations demonstrate that the chiral nature of these states protects the spin of the carriers. These chiral states are therefore potentially useful for spin-based electronics, in which long spin coherence is critical(14), and also for quantum computing applications, where topological protection can enable fault-tolerant information processing(15,16)."], ["Chemical control of structure and guest uptake by a conformationally mobile porous material", "Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are crystalline synthetic porous materials formed by binding organic linkers to metal nodes: they can be either rigid(1,2) or flexible(3). Zeolites and rigid MOFs have widespread applications in sorption, separation and catalysis that arise from their ability to control the arrangement and chemistry of guest molecules in their pores via the shape and functionality of their internal surface, defined by their chemistry and structure(4,5). Their structures correspond to an energy landscape with a single, albeit highly functional, energy minimum. By contrast, proteins function by navigating between multiple metastable structures using bond rotations of the polypeptide(6,7), where each structure lies in one of the minima of a conformational energy landscape and can be selected according to the chemistry of the molecules that interact with the protein. These structural changes are realized through the mechanisms of conformational selection (where a higher-energy minimum characteristic of the protein is stabilized by small-molecule binding) and induced fit (where a small molecule imposes a structure on the protein that is not a minimum in the absence of that molecule)(8). Here we show that rotation about covalent bonds in a peptide linker can change a flexible MOF to afford nine distinct crystal structures, revealing a conformational energy landscape that is characterized by multiple structural minima. The uptake of small-molecule guests by the MOF can be chemically triggered by inducing peptide conformational change. This change transforms the material from a minimum on the landscape that is inactive for guest sorption to an active one. Chemical control of the conformation of a flexible organic linker offers a route to modifying the pore geometry and internal surface chemistry and thus the function of open-framework materials."], ["CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE OF AN INTEGRAL MEMBRANE LIGHT-HARVESTING COMPLEX FROM PHOTOSYNTHETIC BACTERIA", "The crystal structure of the light-harvesting antenna complex (LH2) from Rhodopseudomonas acidophila strain 10050 shows that the active assembly consists of two concentric cylinders of helical protein subunits which enclose the pigment molecules. Eighteen bacteriochlorophyll a molecules sandwiched between the helices form a continuous overlapping ring, and a further nine are positioned between the outer helices with the bacteriochlorin rings perpendicular to the transmembrane helix axis. There is an elegant intertwining of the bacteriochlorophyll phytol chains with carotenoid, which spans the complex."], ["Structure and mechanism of the M2 proton channel of influenza A virus", "The integral membrane protein M2 of influenza virus forms pH-gated proton channels in the viral lipid envelope(1). The low pH of an endosome activates the M2 channel before haemagglutinin-mediated fusion. Conductance of protons acidifies the viral interior and thereby facilitates dissociation of the matrix protein from the viral nucleoproteins - a required process for unpacking of the viral genome(2). In addition to its role in release of viral nucleoproteins, M2 in the trans- Golgi network ( TGN) membrane prevents premature conformational rearrangement of newly synthesized haemagglutinin during transport to the cell surface by equilibrating the pH of the TGN with that of the host cell cytoplasm(3). Inhibiting the proton conductance of M2 using the anti- viral drug amantadine or rimantadine inhibits viral replication(4-7). Here we present the structure of the tetrameric M2 channel in complex with rimantadine, determined by NMR. In the closed state, four tightly packed transmembrane helices define a narrow channel, in which a 'tryptophan gate' is locked by intermolecular interactions with aspartic acid. A carboxy- terminal, amphipathic helix oriented nearly perpendicular to the transmembrane helix forms an inward- facing base. Lowering the pH destabilizes the transmembrane helical packing and unlocks the gate, admitting water to conduct protons, whereas the C- terminal base remains intact, preventing dissociation of the tetramer. Rimantadine binds at four equivalent sites near the gate on the lipid- facing side of the channel and stabilizes the closed conformation of the pore. Drug-resistance mutations are predicted to counter the effect of drug binding by either increasing the hydrophilicity of the pore or weakening helix - helix packing, thus facilitating channel opening."], ["Nonlinear rise in Greenland runoff in response to post-industrial Arctic warming", "The Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) is a growing contributor to global sea-level rise(1), with recent ice mass loss dominated by surface meltwater runoff(2,3). Satellite observations reveal positive trends in GrIS surface melt extent(4), but melt variability, intensity and runoff remain uncertain before the satellite era. Here we present the first continuous, multi-century and observationally constrained record of GrIS surface melt intensity and runoff, revealing that the magnitude of recent GrIS melting is exceptional over at least the last 350 years. We develop this record through stratigraphic analysis of central west Greenland ice cores, and demonstrate that measurements of refrozen melt layers in percolation zone ice cores can be used to quantifiably, and reproducibly, reconstruct past melt rates. We show significant (P < 0.01) and spatially extensive correlations between these ice-core-derived melt records and modelled melt rates(5,6) and satellite-derived melt duration(4) across Greenland more broadly, enabling the reconstruction of past ice-sheet-scale surface melt intensity and runoff. We find that the initiation of increases in GrIS melting closely follow the onset of industrial-era Arctic warming in the mid-1800s, but that the magnitude of GrIS melting has only recently emerged beyond the range of natural variability. Owing to a nonlinear response of surface melting to increasing summer air temperatures, continued atmospheric warming will lead to rapid increases in GrIS runoff and sea-level contributions."], ["The molecular basis of tight nuclear tethering and inactivation of cGAS", "Structural studies show that cyclic GMP-AMP synthase binds to nucleosomes through its DNA-binding site, which maintains it in an inactive conformation and prevents self-DNA binding. Nucleic acids derived from pathogens induce potent innate immune responses(1-6). Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is a double-stranded DNA sensor that catalyses the synthesis of the cyclic dinucleotide cyclic GMP-AMP, which mediates the induction of type I interferons through the STING-TBK1-IRF3 signalling axis(7-11). cGAS was previously thought to not react with self DNA owing to its cytosolic localization(2,12,13); however, recent studies have shown that cGAS is localized mostly in the nucleus and has low activity as a result of tight nuclear tethering(14-18). Here we show that cGAS binds to nucleosomes with nanomolar affinity and that nucleosome binding potently inhibits its catalytic activity. To elucidate the molecular basis of cGAS inactivation by nuclear tethering, we determined the structure of mouse cGAS bound to human nucleosome by cryo-electron microscopy. The structure shows that cGAS binds to a negatively charged acidic patch formed by histones H2A and H2B via its second DNA-binding site(19). High-affinity nucleosome binding blocks double-stranded DNA binding and maintains cGAS in an inactive conformation. Mutations of cGAS that disrupt nucleosome binding alter cGAS-mediated signalling in cells."], ["Structural basis of lenalidomide-induced CK1\u03b1 degradation by the CRL4<SUP>CRBN</SUP> ubiquitin ligase", "Thalidomide and its derivatives, lenalidomide and pomalidomide, are immune modulatory drugs (IMiDs) used in the treatment of haematologic malignancies(1,2). IMiDs bind CRBN, the substrate receptor of the CUL4-RBX1-DDB1-CRBN (also known as CRL4(CRBN)) E3 ubiquitin ligase(3), and inhibit ubiquitination of endogenous CRL4CRBN substrates(4). Unexpectedly, IMiDs also repurpose the ligase to target new proteins for degradation. Lenalidomide induces degradation of the lymphoid transcription factors Ikaros and Aiolos (also known as IKZF1 and IKZF3)(5-7), and casein kinase 1 alpha (CK1 alpha)(8), which contributes to its clinical efficacy in the treatment of multiple myeloma(5) and 5q-deletion associated myelodysplastic syndrome (del(5q) MDS)(8), respectively. How lenalidomide alters the specificity of the ligase to degrade these proteins remains elusive. Here we present the 2.45 angstrom crystal structure of DDB1-CRBN bound to lenalidomide and CK1 alpha. CRBN and lenalidomide jointly provide the binding interface for a CK1 alpha beta-hairpin-loop located in the kinase N-lobe. We show that CK1 alpha binding to CRL4(CRBN) is strictly dependent on the presence of an IMiD. Binding of IKZF1 to CRBN similarly requires the compound and both, IKZF1 and CK1 alpha, use a related binding mode. Our study provides a mechanistic explanation for the selective efficacy of lenalidomide in del(5q) MDS therapy(8,9). We anticipate that high-affinity protein-protein interactions induced by small molecules will provide opportunities for drug development, particularly for targeted protein degradation."], ["m<SUP>6</SUP>A facilitates hippocampus-dependent learning and memory through YTHDF1", "N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A), the most prevalent internal RNA modification on mammalian messenger RNAs, regulates the fates and functions of modified transcripts through m(6)A-specific binding proteins(1-5). In the nervous system, m(6)A is abundant and modulates various neural functions(6-11). Whereas m(6)A marks groups of mRNAs for coordinated degradation in various physiological processes(12-15), the relevance of m(6)A for mRNA translation in vivo remains largely unknown. Here we show that, through its binding protein YTHDF1, m(6)A promotes protein translation of target transcripts in response to neuronal stimuli in the adult mouse hippocampus, thereby facilitating learning and memory. Mice with genetic deletion of Ythdf1 show learning and memory defects as well as impaired hippocampal synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation. Re-expression of YTHDF1 in the hippocampus of adult Ythdf1-knockout mice rescues the behavioural and synaptic defects, whereas hippocampus-specific acute knockdown of Ythdf1 or MettI3, which encodes the catalytic component of the m(6)A methyltransferase complex, recapitulates the hippocampal deficiency. Transcriptome-wide mapping of YTHDF1-binding sites and m(6)A sites on hippocampal mRNAs identified key neuronal genes. Nascent protein labelling and tether reporter assays in hippocampal neurons showed that YTHDF1 enhances protein synthesis in a neuronal-stimulus-dependent manner. In summary, YTHDF1 facilitates translation of m(6)A-methylated neuronal mRNAs in response to neuronal stimulation, and this process contributes to learning and memory."], ["Alcohols as alkylating agents in heteroarene C-H functionalization", "Redox processes and radical intermediates are found in many biochemical processes, including deoxyribonucleotide synthesis and oxidative DNA damage(1). One of the core principles underlying DNA biosynthesis is the radical-mediated elimination of H2O to deoxygenate ribonucleotides, an example of 'spin-centre shift'(2), during which an alcohol C-O bond is cleaved, resulting in a carbon-centred radical intermediate. Although spin-centre shift is a well-understood biochemical process, it is underused by the synthetic organic chemistry community. We wondered whether it would be possible to take advantage of this naturally occurring process to accomplish mild, non-traditional alkylation reactions using alcohols as radical precursors. Because conventional radical-based alkylation methods require the use of stoichiometric oxidants, increased temperatures or peroxides(3-7), a mild protocol using simple and abundant alkylating agents would have considerable use in the synthesis of diversely functionalized pharmacophores. Here we describe the development of a dual catalytic alkylation of heteroarenes, using alcohols as mild alkylating reagents. This method represents the first, to our knowledge, broadly applicable use of unactivated alcohols as latent alkylating reagents, achieved via the successful merger of photoredox and hydrogen atom transfer catalysis. The value of this multi-catalytic protocol has been demonstrated through the late-stage functionalization of the medicinal agents, fasudil and milrinone."], ["Peptidoglycan synthesis drives an FtsZ-treadmilling-independent step of cytokinesis", "Peptidoglycan is the main component of the bacterial wall and protects cells from the mechanical stress that results from high intracellular turgor. Peptidoglycan biosynthesis is very similar in all bacteria; bacterial shapes are therefore mainly determined by the spatial and temporal regulation of peptidoglycan synthesis rather than by the chemical composition of peptidoglycan. The form of rod-shaped bacteria, such as Bacillus subtilis or Escherichia coli, is generated by the action of two peptidoglycan synthesis machineries that act at the septum and at the lateral wall in processes coordinated by the cytoskeletal proteins FtsZ and MreB, respectively(1,2). The tubulin homologue FtsZ is the first protein recruited to the division site, where it assembles in filaments-forming the Z ring-that undergo treadmilling and recruit later divisome proteins(3,4). The rate of treadmilling in B. subtilis controls the rates of both peptidoglycan synthesis and cell division(3). The actin homologue MreB forms discrete patches that move circumferentially around the cell in tracks perpendicular to the long axis of the cell, and organize the insertion of new cell wall during elongation(5,6). Cocci such as Staphylococcus aureus possess only one type of peptidoglycan synthesis machinery(7,8), which is diverted from the cell periphery to the septum in preparation for division(9). The molecular cue that coordinates this transition has remained elusive. Here we investigate the localization of S. aureus peptidoglycan biosynthesis proteins and show that the recruitment of the putative lipid II flippase Murj to the septum, by the DivIB-DivIC-FtsL complex, drives peptidoglycan incorporation to the midcell. Murj recruitment corresponds to a turning point in cytokinesis, which is slow and dependent on FtsZ treadmilling before MurJ arrival but becomes faster and independent of FtsZ treadmilling after peptidoglycan synthesis activity is directed to the septum, where it provides additional force for cell envelope constriction."], ["Strain-hardening and suppression of shear-banding in rejuvenated bulk metallic glass", "Strain-hardening (the increase of flow stress with plastic strain) is the most important phenomenon in the mechanical behaviour of engineering alloys because it ensures that flow is delocalized, enhances tensile ductility and inhibits catastrophic mechanical failure(1,2). Metallic glasses (MGs) lack the crystallinity of conventional engineering alloys, and some of their properties-such as higher yield stress and elastic strain limit(3)-are greatly improved relative to their crystalline counterparts. MGs can have high fracture toughness and have the highest known 'damage tolerance' (defined as the product of yield stress and fracture toughness)(4) among all structural materials. However, the use of MGs in structural applications is largely limited by the fact that they show strain-softening instead of strain-hardening; this leads to extreme localization of plastic flow in shear bands, and is associated with early catastrophic failure in tension. Although rejuvenation of an MG (raising its energy to values that are typical of glass formation at a higher cooling rate) lowers its yield stress, which might enable strain-hardening(5), it is unclear whether sufficient rejuvenation can be achieved in bulk samples while retaining their glassy structure. Here we show that plastic deformation under triaxial compression at room temperature can rejuvenate bulk MG samples sufficiently to enable strain-hardening through a mechanism that has not been previously observed in the metallic state. This transformed behaviour suppresses shear-banding in bulk samples in normal uniaxial (tensile or compressive) tests, prevents catastrophic failure and leads to higher ultimate flow stress. The rejuvenated MGs are stable at room temperature and show exceptionally efficient strain-hardening, greatly increasing their potential use in structural applications. Bulk metallic glasses can acquire the ability to strain-harden through a mechanical rejuvenation treatment at room temperature that retains their non-crystalline structure."], ["Experimental signatures of the mixed axial-gravitational anomaly in the Weyl semimetal NbP", "The conservation laws, such as those of charge, energy and momentum, have a central role in physics. In some special cases, classical conservation laws are broken at the quantum level by quantum fluctuations, in which case the theory is said to have quantum anomalies(1). One of the most prominent examples is the chiral anomaly(2,3), which involves massless chiral fermions. These particles have their spin, or internal angular momentum, aligned either parallel or antiparallel with their linear momentum, labelled as left and right chirality, respectively. In three spatial dimensions, the chiral anomaly is the breakdown (as a result of externally applied parallel electric and magnetic fields(4)) of the classical conservation law that dictates that the number of massless fermions of each chirality are separately conserved. The current that measures the difference between left- and right-handed particles is called the axial current and is not conserved at the quantum level. In addition, an underlying curved space-time provides a distinct contribution to a chiral imbalance, an effect known as the mixed axial-gravitational anomaly(1), but this anomaly has yet to be confirmed experimentally. However, the presence of a mixed gauge-gravitational anomaly has recently been tied to thermoelectrical transport in a magnetic field(5,6), even in flat space-time, suggesting that such types of mixed anomaly could be experimentally probed in condensed matter systems known as Weyl semimetals(7). Here, using a temperature gradient, we observe experimentally a positive magneto-thermoelectric conductance in the Weyl semimetal niobium phosphide (NbP) for collinear temperature gradients and magnetic fields that vanishes in the ultra-quantum limit, when only a single Landau level is occupied. This observation is consistent with the presence of a mixed axial-gravitational anomaly, providing clear evidence for a theoretical concept that has so far eluded experimental detection."], ["Spin-orbit-coupled fermions in an optical lattice clock", "Engineered spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in cold-atom systems can enable the study of new synthetic materials and complex condensed matter phenomena1-8. However, spontaneous emission in alkali-atom spin-orbit-coupled systems is hindered by heating, limiting the observation of many-body effects(1,2,5) and motivating research into potential alternatives(9-11). Here we demonstrate that spin-orbit-coupled fermions can be engineered to occur naturally in a one-dimensional optical lattice clock(12). In contrast to previous SOC experiments(1-11), here the SOC is both generated and probed using a direct ultra-narrow optical clock transition between two electronic orbital states in Sr-87 atoms. We use clock spectroscopy to prepare lattice band populations, internal electronic states and quasi-momenta, and to produce spin-orbit-coupled dynamics. The exceptionally long lifetime of the excited clock state (160 seconds) eliminates decoherence and atom loss from spontaneous emission at all relevant experimental timescales, allowing subsequent momentum-and spin-resolved in situ probing of the SOC band structure and eigenstates. We use these capabilities to study Bloch oscillations, spin-momentum locking and Van Hove singularities in the transition density of states. Our results lay the groundwork for using fermionic optical lattice clocks to probe new phases of matter."], ["MR1 presents microbial vitamin B metabolites to MAIT cells", "Antigen-presenting molecules, encoded by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and CD1 family, bind peptide- and lipid-based antigens, respectively, for recognition by T cells. Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are an abundant population of innate-like T cells in humans that are activated by an antigen(s) bound to the MHC class I-like molecule MR1. Although the identity of MR1-restricted antigen(s) is unknown, it is present in numerous bacteria and yeast. Here we show that the structure and chemistry within the antigen-binding cleft of MR1 is distinct from the MHC and CD1 families. MR1 is ideally suited to bind ligands originating from vitamin metabolites. The structure of MR1 in complex with 6-formyl pterin, a folic acid (vitamin B9) metabolite, shows the pterin ring sequestered within MR1. Furthermore, we characterize related MR1-restricted vitamin derivatives, originating from the bacterial riboflavin (vitamin B2) biosynthetic pathway, which specifically and potently activate MAIT cells. Accordingly, we show that metabolites of vitamin B represent a class of antigen that are presented by MR1 for MAIT-cell immunosurveillance. As many vitamin biosynthetic pathways are unique to bacteria and yeast, our data suggest that MAIT cells use these metabolites to detect microbial infection."], ["Type III CRISPR-Cas systems produce cyclic oligoadenylate second messengers", "In many prokaryotes, type III clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated (Cas) systems detect and degrade invasive genetic elements by an RNA-guided, RNA-targeting multisubunit interference complex. The CRISPR-associated protein Csm6 additionally contributes to interference by functioning as a standalone RNase that degrades invader RNA transcripts, but the mechanism linking invader sensing to Csm6 activity is not understood. Here we show that Csm6 proteins are activated through a second messenger generated by the type III interference complex. Upon target RNA binding by the interference complex, its Cas10 subunit converts ATP into a cyclic oligoadenylate product, which allosterically activates Csm6 by binding to its CRISPR-associated Rossmann fold (CARF) domain. CARF domain mutations that abolish allosteric activation inhibit Csm6 activity in vivo, and mutations in the Cas10 Palm domain phenocopy loss of Csm6. Together, these results point to an unprecedented mechanism for regulation of CRISPR interference that bears striking conceptual similarity to oligoadenylate signalling in mammalian innate immunity."], ["Quantum chemical calculations show that the uranium molecule U<sub>2</sub> has a quintuple bond", "Covalent bonding is commonly described by Lewis's theory(1), with an electron pair shared between two atoms constituting one full bond. Beginning with the valence bond description(2) for the hydrogen molecule, quantum chemists have further explored the fundamental nature of the chemical bond for atoms throughout the periodic table, confirming that most molecules are indeed held together by one electron pair for each bond. But more complex binding may occur when large numbers of atomic orbitals can participate in bond formation. Such behaviour is common with transition metals. When involving heavy actinide elements, metal-metal bonds might prove particularly complicated. To date, evidence for actinide-actinide bonds is restricted to the matrix-isolation(3) of uranium hydrides, including H2U-UH2, and the gas-phase detection(4) and preliminary theoretical study(5) of the uranium molecule, U-2. Here we report quantum chemical calculations on U-2, showing that, although the strength of the U-2 bond is comparable to that of other multiple bonds between transition metals, the bonding pattern is unique. We find that the molecule contains three electron-pair bonds and four one-electron bonds (that is, 10 bonding electrons, corresponding to a quintuple bond), and two ferromagnetically coupled electrons localized on one U atom each-so all known covalent bonding types are contributing."], ["Therapeutic targeting of BET bromodomain proteins in castration-resistant prostate cancer", "Men who develop metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer(CRPC) invariably succumb to the disease. Progression to CRPC after androgen ablation therapy is predominantly driven by deregulated and rogen receptor (AR) signalling(1-3). Despite the success of recently approved therapies targeting AR signalling, such as abiraterone(4-6) and second generation anti-androgens including MDV3100 (also known as enzalutamide) 7,8, durable responses are limited, presumably owing to acquired resistance. Recently, JQ1 and I-BET762 two selective small-molecule inhibitors that target the amino-terminal bromodomains of BRD4, have been shown to exhibit anti-proliferative effects in a range of malignancies(9-12). Here we show that AR-signalling-competent human CRPC cell lines are preferentially sensitive to bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) inhibition. BRD4 physically interacts with the N-terminal domain of AR and can bedisrupted by JQ1(refs 11, 13). Like the direct AR antagonist MDV3100, JQ1 disrupted AR recruitment to target gene loci. By contrast with MDV3100, JQ1 functions downstream of AR, and more potently abrogated BRD4 localization to AR target loci and AR-mediated gene transcription, including induction of the TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and its oncogenic activity. In vivo, BET bromodomain inhibition was more efficacious than direct AR antagonism in CRPC xenograft mouse models. Taken together, these studies provide a novel epigenetic approach for the concerted blockade of oncogenic drivers in advanced prostate cancer."], ["Differential oestrogen receptor binding is associated with clinical outcome in breast cancer", "Oestrogen receptor-alpha (ER) is the defining and driving transcription factor in the majority of breast cancers and its target genes dictate cell growth and endocrine response, yet genomic understanding of ER function has been restricted to model systems(1-3). Here we map genome-wide ER-binding events, by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), in primary breast cancers from patients with different clinical outcomes and in distant ER-positive metastases. We find that drug-resistant cancers still recruit ER to the chromatin, but that ER binding is a dynamic process, with the acquisition of unique ER-binding regions in tumours from patients that are likely to relapse. The acquired ER regulatory regions associated with poor clinical outcome observed in primary tumours reveal gene signatures that predict clinical outcome in ER-positive disease exclusively. We find that the differential ER-binding programme observed in tumours from patients with poor outcome is not due to the selection of a rare subpopulation of cells, but is due to the FOXA1-mediated reprogramming of ER binding on a rapid time-scale. The parallel redistribution of ER and FOXA1 binding events in drug-resistant cellular contexts is supported by histological co-expression of ER and FOXA1 in metastatic samples. By establishing transcription-factor mapping in primary tumour material, we show that there is plasticity in ER-binding capacity, with distinct combinations of cis-regulatory elements linked with the different clinical outcomes."], ["RETRACTED: Room-temperature superconductivity in a carbonaceous sulfur hydride (Retracted Article)", "One of the long-standing challenges in experimental physics is the observation of room-temperature superconductivity(1,2). Recently, high-temperature conventional superconductivity in hydrogen-rich materials has been reported in several systems under high pressure(3-5). An important discovery leading to room-temperature superconductivity is the pressure-driven disproportionation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) to H3S, with a confirmed transition temperature of 203 kelvin at 155 gigapascals(3,6). Both H2S and CH(4)readily mix with hydrogen to form guest-host structures at lower pressures(7), and are of comparable size at 4 gigapascals. By introducing methane at low pressures into the H2S + H(2)precursor mixture for H3S, molecular exchange is allowed within a large assemblage of van der Waals solids that are hydrogen-rich with H(2)inclusions; these guest-host structures become the building blocks of superconducting compounds at extreme conditions. Here we report superconductivity in a photochemically transformed carbonaceous sulfur hydride system, starting from elemental precursors, with a maximum superconducting transition temperature of 287.7 +/- 1.2 kelvin (about 15 degrees Celsius) achieved at 267 +/- 10 gigapascals. The superconducting state is observed over a broad pressure range in the diamond anvil cell, from 140 to 275 gigapascals, with a sharp upturn in transition temperature above 220 gigapascals. Superconductivity is established by the observation of zero resistance, a magnetic susceptibility of up to 190 gigapascals, and reduction of the transition temperature under an external magnetic field of up to 9 tesla, with an upper critical magnetic field of about 62 tesla according to the Ginzburg-Landau model at zero temperature. The light, quantum nature of hydrogen limits the structural and stoichiometric determination of the system by X-ray scattering techniques, but Raman spectroscopy is used to probe the chemical and structural transformations before metallization. The introduction of chemical tuning within our ternary system could enable the preservation of the properties of room-temperature superconductivity at lower pressures. Room-temperature superconductivity is observed in a photochemically synthesized ternary carbonaceous sulfur hydride system at 15 degrees C and 267 GPa."], ["Electrical switching of magnetic order in an orbital Chern insulator", "Magnetism typically arises from the joint effect of Fermi statistics and repulsive Coulomb interactions, which favours ground states with non-zero electron spin. As a result, controlling spin magnetism with electric fields-a longstanding technological goal in spintronics and multiferroics(1,2)-can be achieved only indirectly. Here we experimentally demonstrate direct electric-field control of magnetic states in an orbital Chern insulator(3-6), a magnetic system in which non-trivial band topology favours long-range order of orbital angular momentum but the spins are thought to remain disordered(7-14). We use van der Waals heterostructures consisting of a graphene monolayer rotationally faulted with respect to a Bernal-stacked bilayer to realize narrow and topologically non-trivial valley-projected moire minibands(15-17). At fillings of one and three electrons per moire unit cell within these bands, we observe quantized anomalous Hall effects(18) with transverse resistance approximately equal to h/2e(2) (where h is Planck's constant and e is the charge on the electron), which is indicative of spontaneous polarization of the system into a single-valley-projected band with a Chern number equal to two. At a filling of three electrons per moire unit cell, we find that the sign of the quantum anomalous Hall effect can be reversed via field-effect control of the chemical potential; moreover, this transition is hysteretic, which we use to demonstrate non-volatile electric-field-induced reversal of the magnetic state. A theoretical analysis(19) indicates that the effect arises from the topological edge states, which drive a change in sign of the magnetization and thus a reversal in the favoured magnetic state. Voltage control of magnetic states can be used to electrically pattern non-volatile magnetic-domain structures hosting chiral edge states, with applications ranging from reconfigurable microwave circuit elements to ultralow-power magnetic memories. Non-volatile electrical switching of magnetic order in an orbital Chern insulator is experimentally demonstrated using a moire heterostructure and analysis shows that the effect is driven by topological edge states."], ["A bacterial cytidine deaminase toxin enables CRISPR-free mitochondrial base editing", "Bacterial toxins represent a vast reservoir of biochemical diversity that can be repurposed for biomedical applications. Such proteins include a group of predicted interbacterial toxins of the deaminase superfamily, members of which have found application in gene-editing techniques(1,2). Because previously described cytidine deaminases operate on single-stranded nucleic acids(3), their use in base editing requires the unwinding of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)-for example by a CRISPR-Cas9 system. Base editing within mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), however, has thus far been hindered by challenges associated with the delivery of guide RNA into the mitochondria(4). As a consequence, manipulation of mtDNA to date has been limited to the targeted destruction of the mitochondrial genome by designer nucleases(9,10).Here we describe an interbacterial toxin, which we name DddA, that catalyses the deamination of cytidines within dsDNA. We engineered split-DddA halves that are non-toxic and inactive until brought together on target DNA by adjacently bound programmable DNA-binding proteins. Fusions of the split-DddA halves, transcription activator-like effector array proteins, and a uracil glycosylase inhibitor resulted in RNA-free DddA-derived cytosine base editors (DdCBEs) that catalyse C center dot G-to-T center dot A conversions in human mtDNA with high target specificity and product purity. We used DdCBEs to model a disease-associated mtDNA mutation in human cells, resulting in changes in respiration rates and oxidative phosphorylation. CRISPR-free DdCBEs enable the precise manipulation of mtDNA, rather than the elimination of mtDNA copies that results from its cleavage by targeted nucleases, with broad implications for the study and potential treatment of mitochondrial disorders."], ["Layer-dependent ferromagnetism in a van der Waals crystal down to the monolayer limit", "Since the discovery of graphene(1), the family of two-dimensional materials has grown, displaying a broad range of electronic properties. Recent additions include semiconductors with spin-valley coupling(2), Ising superconductors(3-5) that can be tuned into a quantum metal(6), possible Mott insulators with tunable charge-density waves(7), and topological semimetals with edge transport(8,9). However, no two-dimensional crystal with intrinsic magnetism has yet been discovered(10-14); such a crystal would be useful in many technologies from sensing to data storage(15). Theoretically, magnetic order is prohibited in the two-dimensional isotropic Heisenberg model at finite temperatures by the Mermin-Wagner theorem(16). Magnetic anisotropy removes this restriction, however, and enables, for instance, the occurrence of two-dimensional Ising ferromagnetism. Here we use magneto-optical Kerr effect microscopy to demonstrate that monolayer chromium triiodide (CrI3) is an Ising ferromagnet with out-of-plane spin orientation. Its Curie temperature of 45 kelvin is only slightly lower than that of the bulk crystal, 61 kelvin, which is consistent with a weak interlayer coupling. Moreover, our studies suggest a layer-dependent magnetic phase, highlighting thickness-dependent physical properties typical of van der Waals crystals(17-19). Remarkably, bilayer CrI3 displays suppressed magnetization with a metamagnetic effect(20), whereas in trilayer CrI3 the interlayer ferromagnetism observed in the bulk crystal is restored. This work creates opportunities for studying magnetism by harnessing the unusual features of atomically thin materials, such as electrical control for realizing magnetoelectronics(12), and van der Waals engineering to produce interface phenomena(15)."], ["Direct arylation of strong aliphatic C-H bonds", "Despite the widespread success of transition-metal-catalysed cross-coupling methodologies, considerable limitations still exist in reactions at sp(3)-hybridized carbon atoms, with most approaches relying on prefunctionalized alkylmetal or bromide coupling partners(1-2). Although the use of native functional groups (for example, carboxylic acids, alkenes and alcohols) has improved the overall efficiency of such transformations by expanding the range of potential feedstocks(3-5), the direct functionalization of carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds-the most abundant moiety in organic molecules-represents a more ideal approach to molecular construction. In recent years, an impressive range of reactions that form C(sp(3))-heteroatom bonds from strong C-H bonds has been reported(6-7). Additionally, valuable technologies have been developed for the formation of carbon-carbon bonds from the corresponding C(sp(3))-H bonds via substrate-directed transitionmetal C-H insertion(8), undirected C-H insertion by captodative rhodium carbenoid complexes', or hydrogen atom transfer from weak, hydridic C-H bonds by electrophilic open-shell species(10-14). Despite these advances, a mild and general platform for the coupling of strong, neutral C(sp(3))-H bonds with aryl electrophiles has not been realized. Here we describe a protocol for the direct C(sp(3)) arylation of a diverse set of aliphatic, C-H bond-containing organic frameworks through the combination of light-driven, polyoxometalate-facilitated hydrogen atom transfer and nickel catalysis. This dual-catalytic manifold enables the generation of carbon-centred radicals from strong, neutral C-H bonds, which thereafter act as nucleophiles in nickel-mediated cross-coupling with aryl bromides to afford C(sp(3))-C(sp(2)) cross-coupled products. This technology enables unprecedented, single-step access to a broad array of complex, medicinally relevant molecules directly from natural products and chemical feedstocks through functionalization at sites that are unreactive under traditional methods."], ["Real-time observation of valence electron motion", "The superposition of quantum states drives motion on the atomic and subatomic scales, with the energy spacing of the states dictating the speed of the motion. In the case of electrons residing in the outer (valence) shells of atoms and molecules which are separated by electronvolt energies, this means that valence electron motion occurs on a subfemtosecond to few-femtosecond timescale (1 fs = 10(-15) s). In the absence of complete measurements, the motion can be characterized in terms of a complex quantity, the density matrix. Here we report an attosecond pump-probe measurement of the density matrix of valence electrons in atomic krypton ions(1). We generate the ions with a controlled few-cycle laser field(2) and then probe them through the spectrally resolved absorption of an attosecond extreme-ultraviolet pulse(3), which allows us to observe in real time the subfemtosecond motion of valence electrons over a multifemtosecond time span. We are able to completely characterize the quantum mechanical electron motion and determine its degree of coherence in the specimen of the ensemble. Although the present study uses a simple, prototypical open system, attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy should be applicable to molecules and solid-state materials to reveal the elementary electron motions that control physical, chemical and biological properties and processes."], ["Cryo-EM shows how dynactin recruits two dyneins for faster movement", "Dynein and its cofactor dynactin form a highly processive microtubule motor in the presence of an activating adaptor, such as BICD2. Different adaptors link dynein and dynactin to distinct cargoes. Here we use electron microscopy and single-molecule studies to show that adaptors can recruit a second dynein to dynactin. Whereas BICD2 is biased towards recruiting a single dynein, the adaptors BICDR1 and HOOK3 predominantly recruit two dyneins. We find that the shift towards a double dynein complex increases both the force and speed of the microtubule motor. Our 3.5 A resolution cryoelectron microscopy reconstruction of a dynein tail-dynactin-BICDR1 complex reveals how dynactin can act as a scaffold to coordinate two dyneins side-by-side. Our work provides a structural basis for understanding how diverse adaptors recruit different numbers of dyneins and regulate the motile properties of the dynein-dynactin transport machine."], ["Giant magneto-elastic coupling in multiferroic hexagonal manganites", "The motion of atoms in a solid always responds to cooling or heating in a way that is consistent with the symmetry of the given space group of the solid to which they belong(1,2). When the atoms move, the electronic structure of the solid changes, leading to different physical properties. Therefore, the determination of where atoms are and what atoms do is a cornerstone of modern solid- state physics. However, experimental observations of atomic displacements measured as a function of temperature are very rare, because those displacements are, in almost all cases, exceedingly small(3-5). Here we show, using a combination of diffraction techniques, that the hexagonal manganites RMnO3 ( where R is a rare- earth element) undergo an isostructural transition with exceptionally large atomic displacements: two orders of magnitude larger than those seen in any other magnetic material, resulting in an unusually strong magneto- elastic coupling. We follow the exact atomic displacements of all the atoms in the unit cell as a function of temperature and find consistency with theoretical predictions based on group theories. We argue that this gigantic magneto- elastic coupling in RMnO3 holds the key to the recently observed magneto- electric phenomenon in this intriguing class of materials(6)."], ["Stochastic protein expression in individual cells at the single molecule level", "In a living cell, gene expression - the transcription of DNA to messenger RNA followed by translation to protein - occurs stochastically, as a consequence of the low copy number of DNA and mRNA molecules involved(1-6). These stochastic events of protein production are difficult to observe directly with measurements on large ensembles of cells owing to lack of synchronization among cells. Measurements so far on single cells lack the sensitivity to resolve individual events of protein production. Here we demonstrate a microfluidic- based assay that allows real- time observation of the expression of beta-galactosidase in living Escherichia coli cells with single molecule sensitivity. We observe that protein production occurs in bursts, with the number of molecules per burst following an exponential distribution. We show that the two key parameters of protein expression - the burst size and frequency - can be either determined directly from real- time monitoring of protein production or extracted from a measurement of the steady- state copy number distribution in a population of cells. Application of this assay to probe gene expression in individual budding yeast and mouse embryonic stem cells demonstrates its generality. Many important proteins are expressed at low levels(7,8), and are thus inaccessible by current genomic and proteomic techniques. This microfluidic single cell assay opens up possibilities for system- wide characterization of the expression of these low copy number proteins."], ["Tiny robots and sensors need tiny batteries - here's how to do it", "Improve materials and architectures to shrink microscopic devices.

Whether based on inorganic(2-5) or organic(6-8) materials, the devices that show the highest performance rely on single-crystal interfaces, with their nearly perfect translational symmetry and exceptionally high chemical purity. Attention has recently been focused on developing simple ways of producing electronic devices by means of printing technologies. 'Printed electronics' is being explored for the manufacture of large-area and flexible electronic devices by the patterned application of functional inks containing soluble or dispersed semiconducting materials(9-11). However, because of the strong self-organizing tendency of the deposited materials(12,13), the production of semiconducting thin films of high crystallinity (indispensable for realizing high carrier mobility) may be incompatible with conventional printing processes. Here we develop a method that combines the technique of antisolvent crystallization(14) with inkjet printing to produce organic semiconducting thin films of high crystallinity. Specifically, we show that mixing fine droplets of an antisolvent and a solution of an active semiconducting component within a confined area on an amorphous substrate can trigger the controlled formation of exceptionally uniform single-crystal or polycrystalline thin films that grow at the liquid-air interfaces. Using this approach, we have printed single crystals of the organic semiconductor 2,7-dioctyl[1] benzothieno[3,2-b][1] benzothiophene (C-8-BTBT) (ref. 15), yielding thin-film transistors with average carrier mobilities as high as 16.4 cm(2) V-1 s(-1).

Microplastics are now recognized as widespread contaminants in the atmosphere, where, due to their small size and low density, they can be transported with winds around the Earth(1-25). Atmospheric aerosols, such as mineral dust and other types of airborne particulate matter, influence Earth's climate by absorbing and scattering radiation (direct radiative effects) and their impacts are commonly quantified with the effective radiative forcing (ERF) metric(26). However, the radiative effects of airborne microplastics and associated implications for global climate are unknown. Here we present calculations of the optical properties and direct radiative effects of airborne microplastics (excluding aerosol-cloud interactions). The ERF of airborne microplastics is computed to be 0.044 +/- 0.399 milliwatts per square metre in the present-day atmosphere assuming a uniform surface concentration of 1 microplastic particle per cubic metre and a vertical distribution up to 10 kilometres altitude. However, there are large uncertainties in the geographical and vertical distribution of microplastics. Assuming that they are confined to the boundary layer, shortwave effects dominate and the microplastic ERF is approximately -0.746 +/- 0.553 milliwatts per square metre. Compared with the total ERF due to aerosol-radiation interactions(27) (-0.71 to -0.14 watts per square metre), the microplastic ERF is small. However, plastic production has increased rapidly over the past 70 years(28); without serious attempts to overhaul plastic production and waste-management practices, the abundance and ERF of airborne microplastics will continue to increase."], ["Increasing stability, efficiency, and fundamental understanding of lithium-mediated electrochemical nitrogen reduction", "Lithium-mediated nitrogen reduction is a proven method to electrochemically synthesize ammonia; yet the process has so far been unstable, and the continuous deposition of lithium limits its practical applicability. One major problem of further developing this process is that very little is understood about the mechanism. We develop a model to start understanding the kinetics and we use our understanding to develop a potential cycling procedure. We show experimentally that it improves stability of the system, and leads to a significant increase in faradaic efficiency."], ["Obliquity-paced Pliocene West Antarctic ice sheet oscillations", "Thirty years after oxygen isotope records from microfossils deposited in ocean sediments confirmed the hypothesis that variations in the Earth's orbital geometry control the ice ages(1), fundamental questions remain over the response of the Antarctic ice sheets to orbital cycles(2). Furthermore, an understanding of the behaviour of the marine-based West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS) during the 'warmer-than-present' early-Pliocene epoch (similar to 5-3 Myr ago) is needed to better constrain the possible range of ice-sheet behaviour in the context of future global warming(3). Here we present a marine glacial record from the upper 600 m of the AND-1B sediment core recovered from beneath the northwest part of the Ross ice shelf by the ANDRILL programme and demonstrate well-dated, similar to 40-kyr cyclic variations in ice-sheet extent linked to cycles in insolation influenced by changes in the Earth's axial tilt (obliquity) during the Pliocene. Our data provide direct evidence for orbitally induced oscillations in the WAIS, which periodically collapsed, resulting in a switch from grounded ice, or ice shelves, to open waters in the Ross embayment when planetary temperatures were up to similar to 3 degrees C warmer than today(4) and atmospheric CO2 concentration was as high as similar to 400 p. p. m. v. (refs 5, 6). The evidence is consistent with a new ice-sheet/ice-shelf model(7) that simulates fluctuations in Antarctic ice volume of up to +7 m in equivalent sea level associated with the loss of the WAIS and up to +3 m in equivalent sea level from the East Antarctic ice sheet, in response to ocean-induced melting paced by obliquity.

In addition to forming disulfide bridges, cysteine residues are susceptible to oxidation by reactive oxygen species, and are thus central not only to the scavenging of these but also to cellular signalling and communication in biological as well as pathological contexts(5,6). Oxidized cysteine species are highly reactive and may form covalent conjugates with, for example, tyrosines in the active sites of some redox enzymes(7,8). However, to our knowledge, regulatory switches with covalent crosslinks other than disulfides have not previously been demonstrated. Here we report the discovery of a covalent crosslink between a cysteine and a lysine residue with a NOS bridge that serves as an allosteric redox switch in the transaldolase enzyme of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the pathogen that causes gonorrhoea. X-ray structure analysis of the protein in the oxidized and reduced state reveals a loaded-spring mechanism that involves a structural relaxation upon redox activation, which is propagated from the allosteric redox switch at the protein surface to the active site in the protein interior. This relaxation leads to a reconfiguration of key catalytic residues and elicits an increase in enzymatic activity of several orders of magnitude. The redox switch is highly conserved in related transaldolases from other members of the Neisseriaceae; for example, it is present in the transaldolase of Neisseria meningitides (a pathogen that is the primary cause of meningitis and septicaemia in children). We surveyed the Protein Data Bank and found that the NOS bridge exists in diverse protein families across all domains of life (including Homo sapiens) and that it is often located at catalytic or regulatory hotspots. Our findings will inform strategies for the design of proteins and peptides, as well as the development of new classes of drugs and antibodies that target the lysine-cysteine redox switch(9,10)."], ["Bayesian reaction optimization as a tool for chemical synthesis", "Reaction optimization is fundamental to synthetic chemistry, from optimizing the yield of industrial processes to selecting conditions for the preparation of medicinal candidates1. Likewise, parameter optimization is omnipresent in artificial intelligence, from tuning virtual personal assistants to training social media and product recommendation systems2. Owing to the high cost associated with carrying out experiments, scientists in both areas set numerous (hyper)parameter values by evaluating only a small subset of the possible configurations. Bayesian optimization, an iterative response surface-based global optimization algorithm, has demonstrated exceptional performance in the tuning of machine learning models3. Bayesian optimization has also been recently applied in chemistry4,5,6,7,8,9; however, its application and assessment for reaction optimization in synthetic chemistry has not been investigated. Here we report the development of a framework for Bayesian reaction optimization and an open-source software tool that allows chemists to easily integrate state-of-the-art optimization algorithms into their everyday laboratory practices. We collect a large benchmark dataset for a palladium-catalysed direct arylation reaction, perform a systematic study of Bayesian optimization compared to human decision-making in reaction optimization, and apply Bayesian optimization to two real-world optimization efforts (Mitsunobu and deoxyfluorination reactions). Benchmarking is accomplished via an online game that links the decisions made by expert chemists and engineers to real experiments run in the laboratory. Our findings demonstrate that Bayesian optimization outperforms human decisionmaking in both average optimization efficiency (number of experiments) and consistency (variance of outcome against initially available data). Overall, our studies suggest that adopting Bayesian optimization methods into everyday laboratory practices could facilitate more efficient synthesis of functional chemicals by enabling better-informed, data-driven decisions about which experiments to run."], ["Establishing reaction networks in the 16-electron sulfur reduction reaction", "The sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) plays a central role in high-capacity lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The SRR involves an intricate, 16-electron conversion process featuring multiple lithium polysulfide intermediates and reaction branches1-3. Establishing the complex reaction network is essential for rational tailoring of the SRR for improved Li-S batteries, but represents a daunting challenge4-6. Herein we systematically investigate the electrocatalytic SRR to decipher its network using the nitrogen, sulfur, dual-doped holey graphene framework as a model electrode to understand the role of electrocatalysts in acceleration of conversion kinetics. Combining cyclic voltammetry, in situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we identify and directly profile the key intermediates (S8, Li2S8, Li2S6, Li2S4 and Li2S) at varying potentials and elucidate their conversion pathways. Li2S4 and Li2S6 were predominantly observed, in which Li2S4 represents the key electrochemical intermediate dictating the overall SRR kinetics. Li2S6, generated (consumed) through a comproportionation (disproportionation) reaction, does not directly participate in electrochemical reactions but significantly contributes to the polysulfide shuttling process. We found that the nitrogen, sulfur dual-doped holey graphene framework catalyst could help accelerate polysulfide conversion kinetics, leading to faster depletion of soluble lithium polysulfides at higher potential and hence mitigating the polysulfide shuttling effect and boosting output potential. These results highlight the electrocatalytic approach as a promising strategy for tackling the fundamental challenges regarding Li-S batteries. We investigate the mechanism underlying the sulfur reduction reaction that plays a central role in high-capacity lithium sulfur batteries, highlighting the electrocatalytic approach as a promising strategy for tackling the fundamental challenges associated with these batteries."], ["The African coelacanth genome provides insights into tetrapod evolution", "The discovery of a living coelacanth specimen in 1938 was remarkable, as this lineage of lobe-finned fish was thought to have become extinct 70 million years ago. The modern coelacanth looks remarkably similar to many of its ancient relatives, and its evolutionary proximity to our own fish ancestors provides a glimpse of the fish that first walked on land. Here we report the genome sequence of the African coelacanth, Latimeria chalumnae. Through a phylogenomic analysis, we conclude that the lungfish, and not the coelacanth, is the closest living relative of tetrapods. Coelacanth protein-coding genes are significantly more slowly evolving than those of tetrapods, unlike other genomic features. Analyses of changes in genes and regulatory elements during the vertebrate adaptation to land highlight genes involved in immunity, nitrogen excretion and the development of fins, tail, ear, eye, brain and olfaction. Functional assays of enhancers involved in the fin-to-limb transition and in the emergence of extra-embryonic tissues show the importance of the coelacanth genome as a blueprint for understanding tetrapod evolution."], ["Replication stress links structural and numerical cancer chromosomal instability", "Cancer chromosomal instability (CIN) results in an increased rate of change of chromosome number and structure and generates intratumour heterogeneity(1,2).

Here we find evidence for impaired replication fork progression and increased DNA replication stress in CIN+ colorectal cancer (CRC) cells relative to CIN- CRC cells, with structural chromosome abnormalities precipitating chromosome missegregation in mitosis. We identify three new CIN-suppressor genes (PIGN (also known as MCD4), MEX3C (RKHD2) and ZNF516 (KIAA0222)) encoded on chromosome 18q that are subject to frequent copy number loss in CIN+ CRC. Chromosome 18q loss was temporally associated with aneuploidy onset at the adenoma-carcinoma transition. CIN-suppressor gene silencing leads to DNA replication stress, structural chromosome abnormalities and chromosome missegregation. Supplementing cells with nucleosides, to alleviate replication-associated damage(5), reduces the frequency of chromosome segregation errors after CIN-suppressor gene silencing, and attenuates segregation errors and DNA damage in CIN+ cells. These data implicate a central role for replication stress in the generation of structural and numerical CIN, which may inform new therapeutic approaches to limit intratumour heterogeneity."], ["Doubling the critical temperature of La<sub>1.9</sub>Sr<sub>0.1</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> using epitaxial strain", "The discovery(1) of high-temperature superconductivity in copper oxides raised the possibility that superconductivity could be achieved at room temperature. But since 1993, when a critical temperature (T-c) of 133 K was observed in the HgBa2Ca2Cu3O8+delta (ref. 2), no further progress has been made in raising the critical temperature through material design. It has been shown, however, that the application of hydrostatic pressure can raise T-c-up to similar to 164 K in the case of HgBa2Ca2Cu3O8+delta (ref. 3). Here we show by analysing the uniaxial strain and pressure derivatives of T-c, that compressive epitaxial strain in thin films of copper oxide superconductors could in principle generate much larger increases in the critical temperature than obtained by comparable hydrostatic pressures. We demonstrate the experimental feasibility of this approach for the compound La1.9Sr0.1CuO4, where we obtain a critical temperature of 49 K in strained single-crystal thin films-roughly double the bulk value of 25 K. Furthermore, the resistive behaviour at low temperatures (but above T-c) of the strained samples changes markedly, going from insulating to metallic."], ["Accessing non-natural reactivity by irradiating nicotinamide-dependent enzymes with light", "Enzymes are ideal for use in asymmetric catalysis by the chemical industry, because their chemical compositions can be tailored to a specific substrate and selectivity pattern while providing efficiencies and selectivities that surpass those of classical synthetic methods(1). However, enzymes are limited to reactions that are found in nature and, as such, facilitate fewer types of transformation than do other forms of catalysis(2). Thus, a longstanding challenge in the field of biologically mediated catalysis has been to develop enzymes with new catalytic functions(3). Here we describe a method for achieving catalytic promiscuity that uses the photoexcited state of nicotinamide co-factors (molecules that assist enzyme-mediated catalysis). Under irradiation with visible light, the nicotinamide-dependent enzyme known as ketoreductase can be transformed from a carbonyl reductase into an initiator of radical species and a chiral source of hydrogen atoms. We demonstrate this new reactivity through a highly enantioselective radical dehalogenation of lactones-a challenging transformation for small-molecule catalysts(4-7). Mechanistic experiments support the theory that a radical species acts as an intermediate in this reaction, with NADH and NADPH (the reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine nucleotide and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, respectively) serving as both a photoreductant and the source of hydrogen atoms. To our knowledge, this method represents the first example of photo-induced enzyme promiscuity, and highlights the potential for accessing new reactivity from existing enzymes simply by using the excited states of common biological co-factors. This represents a departure from existing light-driven biocatalytic techniques, which are typically explored in the context of co-factor regeneration(8,9)."], ["Pd-Catalyzed Suzuki coupling reactions of aryl halides containing basic nitrogen centers with arylboronic acids in water in the absence of added base", "The Pd-catalyzed Suzuki coupling reactions of a series of aryl chlorides and aryl bromides containing basic nitrogen centers with arylboronic acids in water in the absence of added base are reported. The reactions proceed either partially or entirely under acidic conditions. After surveying twenty-two phosphorus ligands, high yields of products were obtained with aryl chlorides only when a bulky ligand, 2-(di-tert-butyl-phosphino)-1-phenyl-1H-pyrrole (cataCXium\u00aePtB) was used. In contrast, aryl bromides produced high yields of products in the absence of both added base and added ligand. In order to explore the Suzuki coupling process entirely under acidic conditions, a series of reactions were conducted in buffered acidic media using several model substrates. 4-Chlorobenzylamine, in the presence of cataCXium\u00aePtB, produced high yields of product at buffered pH 6.0; the yields dropped off precipitously at buffered pH 5.0 and lower. The fall-off in yield was attributed to the decomposition of the Pd\u2013ligand complex due to the protonation of the ligand in the more acidic aqueous media. In contrast, in the absence of an added ligand, 4-amino-2-chloropyridine produced quantitative yields at buffered pH 3.5 and 4.5 while 4-amino-2-bromopyridine produced quantitative yields in a series of buffered media ranging from pH 4.5 to 1.5. These substrates are only partially protonated in acidic media and can behave as active Pd ligands in the Suzuki catalytic cycle."], ["Dysregulation of brain and choroid plexus cell types in severe COVID-19", "Although SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the respiratory system, patients with and survivors of COVID-19 can suffer neurological symptoms(1-3). However, an unbiased understanding of the cellular and molecular processes that are affected in the brains of patients with COVID-19 is missing. Here we profile 65,309 single-nucleus transcriptomes from 30 frontal cortex and choroid plexus samples across 14 control individuals (including 1 patient with terminal influenza) and 8 patients with COVID-19. Although our systematic analysis yields no molecular traces of SARS-CoV-2 in the brain, we observe broad cellular perturbations indicating that barrier cells of the choroid plexus sense and relay peripheral inflammation into the brain and show that peripheral T cells infiltrate the parenchyma. We discover microglia and astrocyte subpopulations associated with COVID-19 that share features with pathological cell states that have previously been reported in human neurodegenerative disease(4-6). Synaptic signalling of upper-layer excitatory neurons-which are evolutionarily expanded in humans(7) and linked to cognitive function(8)-is preferentially affected in COVID-19. Across cell types, perturbations associated with COVID-19 overlap with those found in chronic brain disorders and reside in genetic variants associated with cognition, schizophrenia and depression.

Particularly intriguing are spider silks, with studies having explored properties ranging from their protein sequence(6) to the geometry of a web(7). This material system(8), highly adapted to meet a spider's many needs, has superior mechanical properties(9-15). In spite of much research into the molecular design underpinning the outstanding performance of silk fibres(1,6,10,13,16,17), and into the mechanical characteristics of web-like structures(18-21), it remains unknown how the mechanical characteristics of spider silk contribute to the integrity and performance of a spider web. Here we report web deformation experiments and simulations that identify the nonlinear response of silk threads to stress-involving softening at a yield point and substantial stiffening at large strain until failure-as being crucial to localize load-induced deformation and resulting in mechanically robust spider webs. Control simulations confirmed that a nonlinear stress response results in superior resistance to structural defects in the web compared to linear elastic or elastic-plastic (softening) material behaviour. We also show that under distributed loads, such as those exerted by wind, the stiff behaviour of silk under small deformation, before the yield point, is essential in maintaining the web's structural integrity. The superior performance of silk in webs is therefore not due merely to its exceptional ultimate strength and strain, but arises from the nonlinear response of silk threads to strain and their geometrical arrangement in a web."], ["Olfactory receptor and circuit evolution promote host specialization", "The evolution of animal behaviour is poorly understood(1,2). Despite numerous correlations between interspecific divergence in behaviour and nervous system structure and function, demonstrations of the genetic basis of these behavioural differences remain rare(3-5). Here we develop a neurogenetic model, Drosophila sechellia, a species that displays marked differences in behaviour compared to its close cousin Drosophila melanogaster(6,7), which are linked to its extreme specialization on noni fruit (Morinda citrifolia)(8-16). Using calcium imaging, we identify olfactory pathways in D. sechellia that detect volatiles emitted by the noni host. Our mutational analysis indicates roles for different olfactory receptors in long- and short-range attraction to noni, and our cross-species allele-transfer experiments demonstrate that the tuning of one of these receptors is important for species-specific host-seeking. We identify the molecular determinants of this functional change, and characterize their evolutionary origin and behavioural importance. We perform circuit tracing in the D. sechellia brain, and find that receptor adaptations are accompanied by increased sensory pooling onto interneurons as well as species-specific central projection patterns. This work reveals an accumulation of molecular, physiological and anatomical traits that are linked to behavioural divergence between species, and defines a model for investigating speciation and the evolution of the nervous system. A neurogenetic model, Drosophila sechellia-a relative of Drosophila melanogaster that has developed an extreme specialization for a single host plant-sheds light on the evolution of interspecific differences in behaviour."], ["A spin-orbital-entangled quantum liquid on a honeycomb lattice", "The honeycomb lattice is one of the simplest lattice structures. Electrons and spins on this simple lattice, however, often form exotic phases with non-trivial excitations. Massless Dirac fermions can emerge out of itinerant electrons, as demonstrated experimentally in graphene(1), and a topological quantum spin liquid with exotic quasiparticles can be realized in spin-1/2 magnets, as proposed theoretically in the Kitaev model(2). The quantum spin liquid is a long-sought exotic state of matter, in which interacting spins remain quantum-disordered without spontaneous symmetry breaking(3). The Kitaev model describes one example of a quantum spin liquid, and can be solved exactly by introducing two types of Majorana fermion(2). Realizing a Kitaev model in the laboratory, however, remains a challenge in materials science. Mott insulators with a honeycomb lattice of spin-orbital-entangled pseudospin-1/2 moments have been proposed(4), including the 5d-electron systems alpha-Na2IrO3 (ref. 5) and alpha-Li2IrO3 (ref. 6) and the 4d-electron system alpha-RuCl3 (ref.7). However, these candidates were found to magnetically order rather than form a liquid at sufficiently low temperatures(8-10), owing to non-Kitaev interactions(6,11-13). Here we report a quantum-liquid state of pseudospin-1/2 moments in the 5d-electron honeycomb compound H3LiIr2O6. This iridate does not display magnetic ordering down to 0.05 kelvin, despite an interaction energy of about 100 kelvin. We observe signatures of low-energy fermionic excitations that originate from a small number of spin defects in the nuclear-magnetic-resonance relaxation and the specific heat. We therefore conclude that H3LiIr2O6 is a quantum spin liquid. This result opens the door to finding exotic quasiparticles in a strongly spin-orbit-coupled 5d-electron transition-metal oxide."], ["Precise interpolar phasing of abrupt climate change during the last ice age", "The last glacial period exhibited abrupt Dansgaard-Oeschger climatic oscillations, evidence of which is preserved in a variety of Northern Hemisphere palaeodimate archives'. Ice cores show that Antarctica cooled during the warm phases of the Greenland Dansgaard-Oeschger cycle and vice versa''', suggesting an interhemispheric redistribution of heat through a mechanism called the bipolar seesaw(4-6). Variations in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) strength are thought to have been important, but much uncertainty remains regarding the dynamics and trigger of these abrupt events'. Key information is contained in the relative phasing of hemispheric climate variations, yet the large, poorly constrained difference between gas age and ice age and the relatively low resolution of methane records from Antarctic ice cores have so far precluded methane-based synchronization at the required sub-centennial precision''''\". Here we use a recently drilled high-accumulation Antarctic ice core to show that, on average, abrupt Greenland warming leads the corresponding Antarctic cooling onset by 218 +/- 92 years (2 sigma a) for DansgaardOeschger events, including the Bolling event; Greenland cooling leads the corresponding onset of Antarctic warming by 208 +/- 96 years. Our results demonstrate a north-to-south directionality of the abrupt climatic signal, which is propagated to the Southern Hemisphere high latitudes by oceanic rather than atmospheric processes. The similar interpolar phasing of warming and cooling transitions suggests that the transfer time of the climatic signal is independent of the AMOC background state. Our findings confirm a central role for ocean circulation in the bipolar seesaw and provide clear criteria for assessing hypotheses and model simulations of Dansgaard-Oeschger dynamics."], ["Functional materials discovery using energy-structure-function maps", "Molecular crystals cannot be designed in the same manner as macroscopic objects, because they do not assemble according to simple, intuitive rules. Their structures result from the balance of many weak interactions, rather than from the strong and predictable bonding patterns found in metal-organic frameworks and covalent organic frameworks. Hence, design strategies that assume a topology or other structural blueprint will often fail. Here we combine computational crystal structure prediction and property prediction to build energy-structure-function maps that describe the possible structures and properties that are available to a candidate molecule. Using these maps, we identify a highly porous solid, which has the lowest density reported for a molecular crystal so far. Both the structure of the crystal and its physical properties, such as methane storage capacity and guest-molecule selectivity, are predicted using the molecular structure as the only input. More generally, energy-structure-function maps could be used to guide the experimental discovery of materials with any target function that can be calculated from predicted crystal structures, such as electronic structure or mechanical properties."], ["The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 is a negative regulator of macrophage activation", "The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-dependent transcription factors that is predominantly expressed in adipose tissue, adrenal gland and spleen(1-3). PPAR-gamma has been demonstrated to regulate adipocyte differentiation and glucose homeostasis in response to several structurally distinct compounds, including thiazolidinediones and fibrates(3-6). Naturally occurring compounds such as fatty acids and the prostaglandin D-2 metabolite 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14) prostaglandin J(2) (15d-PGJ(2)) bind to PPAR-gamma and stimulate transcription of target genes(7-10). Prostaglandin D-2 metabolites have not yet been identified in adipose tissue, but are major products of arachidonic-acid metabolism in macrophages(11), raising the possibility that they might serve as endogenous PPAR-gamma ligands in this cell type, Here we show that PPAR-gamma is markedly upregulated in activated macrophages and inhibits the expression of the inducible nitric oxide synthase, gelatinase B and scavenger receptor A genes in response to 15d-PGJ(2) and synthetic PPAR-gamma ligands, PPAR-gamma inhibits gene expression in part by antagonizing the activities of the transcription factors AP-1, STAT and NF-kappa B, These observations suggest that PPAR-gamma and locally produced prostaglandin D-2 metabolites are involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses, and raise the possibility that synthetic PPAR-gamma ligands may be of therapeutic value in human diseases such as atherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis in which activated macrophages exert pathogenic effects."], ["Capillary flow as the cause of ring stains from dried liquid drops", "When a spilled drop of coffee dries on a solid surface, it leaves a dense, ring-like deposit along the perimeter (Fig. 1a). The coffee-initially dispersed over the entire drop-becomes concentrated into a tiny fraction of it. Such ring deposits are common wherever drops containing dispersed solids evaporate on a surface, and they influence processes such as printing, washing and coating(1-5). Ring deposits also provide a potential means to write or deposit a fine pattern onto a surface. Here we ascribe the characteristic pattern of the deposition to a form of capillary flow in which pinning of the contact line of the drying drop ensures that liquid evaporating from the edge is replenished by liquid from the interior, The resulting outward flow can carry virtually all the dispersed material to the edge. This mechanism predicts a distinctive power-law growth of the ring mass with time-a law independent of the particular substrate, carrier fluid or deposited solids. We have verified this law by microscopic observations of colloidal fluids."], ["Reconciling the temperature dependence of respiration across timescales and ecosystem types", "Ecosystem respiration is the biotic conversion of organic carbon to carbon dioxide by all of the organisms in an ecosystem, including both consumers and primary producers. Respiration exhibits an exponential temperature dependence at the subcellular and individual levels(1), but at the ecosystem level respiration can be modified by many variables(2-4) including community abundance and biomass(5), which vary substantially among ecosystems(6). Despite its importance for predicting the responses of the biosphere to climate change, it is as yet unknown whether the temperature dependence of ecosystem respiration varies systematically between aquatic and terrestrial environments. Here we use the largest database of respiratory measurements yet compiled to show that the sensitivity of ecosystem respiration to seasonal changes in temperature is remarkably similar for diverse environments encompassing lakes, rivers, estuaries, the open ocean and forested and non-forested terrestrial ecosystems, with an average activation energy similar to that of the respiratory complex(3) (approximately 0.65 electronvolts (eV)). By contrast, annual ecosystem respiration shows a substantially greater temperature dependence across aquatic (approximately 0.65 eV) versus terrestrial ecosystems (approximately 0.32 eV) that span broad geographic gradients in temperature. Using a model(5) derived from metabolic theory(7), these findings can be reconciled by similarities in the biochemical kinetics of metabolism at the subcellular level, and fundamental differences in the importance of other variables besides temperature-such as primary productivity and allochthonous carbon inputs-on the structure of aquatic and terrestrial biota at the community level."], ["The relationship between fragility, configurational entropy and the potential energy landscape of glass-forming liquids", "Glass is a microscopically disordered, solid form of matter that results when a fluid is cooled or compressed in such a manner that it does not crystallize. Almost all types of materials are capable of glass formation, including polymers, metal alloys and molten salts. Given such diversity, general principles by which different glass-forming materials can be systematically classified are invaluable. One such principle is the classification of glass-formers according to their fragility(1). Fragility measures the rapidity with which a liquid's properties (such as viscosity) change as the glassy state is approached. Although the relationship between the fragility, configurational entropy and features of the energy landscape (the complicated dependence of energy on configuration) of a glass-former have been analysed previously(2), a detailed understanding of the origins of fragility is lacking. Here I use simulations to analyse the relationship between fragility and quantitative measures of the energy landscape for a model liquid whose fragility depends on its bulk density. The results reveal that fragility depends on changes in the vibrational properties of individual energy minima in addition to their total number and spread in energy. A thermodynamic expression for fragility is derived, which is in quantitative agreement with kinetic fragilities obtained from the liquid's diffusivity."], ["Climate-driven trends in contemporary ocean productivity", "Contributing roughly half of the biosphere's net primary production (NPP)(1,2), photosynthesis by oceanic phytoplankton is a vital link in the cycling of carbon between living and inorganic stocks. Each day, more than a hundred million tons of carbon in the form of CO2 are fixed into organic material by these ubiquitous, microscopic plants of the upper ocean, and each day a similar amount of organic carbon is transferred into marine ecosystems by sinking and grazing. The distribution of phytoplankton biomass and NPP is defined by the availability of light and nutrients ( nitrogen, phosphate, iron). These growth-limiting factors are in turn regulated by physical processes of ocean circulation, mixed-layer dynamics, upwelling, atmospheric dust deposition, and the solar cycle. Satellite measurements of ocean colour provide a means of quantifying ocean productivity on a global scale and linking its variability to environmental factors. Here we describe global ocean NPP changes detected from space over the past decade. The period is dominated by an initial increase in NPP of 1,930 teragrams of carbon a year (Tg C yr(-1)), followed by a prolonged decrease averaging 190 Tg C yr(-1). These trends are driven by changes occurring in the expansive stratified low-latitude oceans and are tightly coupled to coincident climate variability. This link between the physical environment and ocean biology functions through changes in upper-ocean temperature and stratification, which influence the availability of nutrients for phytoplankton growth. The observed reductions in ocean productivity during the recent post-1999 warming period provide insight on how future climate change can alter marine food webs."], ["Electronic acceleration of atomic motions and disordering in bismuth", "The development of X-ray and electron diffraction methods with ultrahigh time resolution has made it possible to map directly, at the atomic level, structural changes in solids induced by laser excitation(1-8). This has resulted in unprecedented insights into the lattice dynamics of solids undergoing phase transitions. In aluminium, for example, femtosecond optical excitation hardly affects the potential energy surface of the lattice; instead, melting of the material is governed by the transfer of thermal energy between the excited electrons and the initially cold lattice(1). In semiconductors, in contrast, exciting similar to 10 per cent of the valence electrons results in non-thermal lattice collapse owing to the anti-bonding character of the conduction band(2-5,9,10). These different material responses raise the intriguing question of how Peierls-distorted systems(11) such as bismuth(12) will respond to strong excitations. The evolution of the atomic configuration of bismuth upon excitation of its A(1g) lattice mode, which involves damped oscillations of atoms along the direction of the Peierls distortion of the crystal, has been probed(6-8), but the actual melting of the material has not yet been investigated. Here we present a femtosecond electron diffraction study of the structural changes in crystalline bismuth as it undergoes laser-induced melting. We find that the dynamics of the phase transition depend strongly on the excitation intensity, with melting occurring within 190 fs ( that is, within half a period of the unperturbed A(1g) lattice mode(6-8)) at the highest excitation. We attribute the surprising speed of the melting process to laser-induced changes in the potential energy surface of the lattice, which result in strong acceleration of the atoms along the longitudinal direction of the lattice and efficient coupling of this motion to an unstable transverse vibrational mode. That is, the atomic motions in crystalline bismuth can be electronically accelerated so that the solid-to-liquid(13) phase transition occurs on a sub-vibrational timescale."], ["Disulfide-Mediated Reversible Polymerization toward Intrinsically Dynamic Smart Materials", "The development of a dynamic chemistry toolbox to endow materials dynamic behavior has been key to the rational design of future smart materials.

Within this toolbox, the building blocks based on 1,2-dithiolanes have become an important scaffold, featuring their reversible polymerization mediated by dynamic covalent disulfide bonds, which enables a unique class of dynamic materials at the intersection of supramolecular polymers and adaptable covalent networks. This Perspective aims to explore the dynamic chemistry of 1,2-dithiolanes as a versatile structural unit for the design of smart materials by summarizing the state of the art as well as providing an overview of the fundamental challenges involved in this research area and its potential future directions"], ["Imaging and dynamics of light atoms and molecules on graphene", "Observing the individual building blocks of matter is one of the primary goals of microscopy. The invention of the scanning tunnelling microscope(1) revolutionized experimental surface science in that atomic- scale features on a solid- state surface could finally be readily imaged. However, scanning tunnelling microscopy has limited applicability due to restrictions in, for example, sample conductivity, cleanliness, and data acquisition rate. An older microscopy technique, that of transmission electron microscopy (TEM)(2,3), has benefited tremendously in recent years from subtle instrumentation advances, and individual heavy ( high-atomic-number) atoms can now be detected by TEM4-7 even when embedded within a semiconductor material(8,9). But detecting an individual low- atomic- number atom, for example carbon or even hydrogen, is still extremely challenging, if not impossible, via conventional TEM owing to the very low contrast of light elements(2,3,10) (-12). Here we demonstrate a means to observe, by conventional TEM, even the smallest atoms and molecules: on a clean single- layer graphene membrane, adsorbates such as atomic hydrogen and carbon can be seen as if they were suspended in free space. We directly image such individual adatoms, along with carbon chains and vacancies, and investigate their dynamics in real time. These techniques open a way to reveal dynamics of more complex chemical reactions or identify the atomic- scale structure of unknown adsorbates.

Recently, macroscopic- scale graphene films were prepared by two- dimensional assembly of graphene sheets chemically derived from graphite crystals and graphene oxides(2,3). However, the sheet resistance of these films was found to be much larger than theoretically expected values. Here we report the direct synthesis of large- scale graphene films using chemical vapour deposition on thin nickel layers, and present two different methods of patterning the films and transferring them to arbitrary substrates. The transferred graphene films show very low sheet resistance of similar to 280 Omega per square, with 80 per cent optical transparency. At low temperatures, the monolayers transferred to silicon dioxide substrates show electron mobility greater than 3,700 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) and exhibit the half- integer quantum Hall effect(4,5), implying that the quality of graphene grown by chemical vapour deposition is as high as mechanically cleaved graphene(6). Employing the outstanding mechanical properties of graphene(7), we also demonstrate the macroscopic use of these highly conducting and transparent electrodes in flexible, stretchable, foldable electronics(8,9)."], ["<i>In vivo</i> genome-wide profiling of RNA secondary structure reveals novel regulatory features", "RNA structure has critical roles in processes ranging from ligand sensing to the regulation of translation, polyadenylation and splicing(1-4). However, a lack of genome-wide in vivo RNA structural data has limited our understanding of how RNA structure regulates gene expression in living cells. Here we present a high-throughput, genome-wide in vivo RNA structure probing method, structure-seq, in which dimethyl sulphate methylation of unprotected adenines and cytosines is identified by next-generation sequencing. Application of this method to Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings yielded the first in vivo genome-wide RNA structure map at nucleotide resolution for any organism, with quantitative structural information across more than 10,000 transcripts. Our analysis reveals a three-nucleotide periodic repeat pattern in the structure of coding regions, as well as a less-structured region immediately upstream of the start codon, and shows that these features are strongly correlated with translation efficiency. We also find patterns of strong and weak secondary structure at sites of alternative polyadenylation, as well as strong secondary structure at 59 splice sites that correlates with unspliced events. Notably, in vivo structures of messenger RNAs annotated for stress responses are poorly predicted in silico, whereas mRNA structures of genes related to cell function maintenance are well predicted. Global comparison of several structural features between these two categories shows that the mRNAs associated with stress responses tend to have more single-strandedness, longer maximal loop length and higher free energy per nucleotide, features that may allow these RNAs to undergo conformational changes in response to environmental conditions. Structure-seq allows the RNA structurome and its biological roles to be interrogated on a genome-wide scale and should be applicable to any organism."], ["Collective bulk carrier delocalization driven by electrostatic surface charge accumulation", "In the classic transistor, the number of electric charge carriers-and thus the electrical conductivity-is precisely controlled by external voltage, providing electrical switching capability. This simple but powerful feature is essential for information processing technology, and also provides a platform for fundamental physics research(1-16). As the number of charges essentially determines the electronic phase of a condensed-matter system, transistor operation enables reversible and isothermal changes in the system's state, as successfully demonstrated in electric-field-induced ferromagnetism(2-4) and superconductivity(5-10). However, this effect of the electric field is limited to a channel thickness of nanometres or less, owing to the presence of Thomas-Fermi screening. Here we show that this conventional picture does not apply to a class of materials characterized by inherent collective interactions between electrons and the crystal lattice. We prepared metal-insulator-semiconductor field-effect transistors based on vanadium dioxide-a strongly correlated-material with a thermally driven, first-order metal-insulator transition well above room temperature(17-23)-and found that electrostatic charging at a surface drives all the previously localized charge carriers in the bulk material into motion, leading to the emergence of a three-dimensional metallic ground state. This non-local switching of the electronic state is achieved by applying a voltage of only about one volt. In a voltage-sweep measurement, the first-order nature of the metal-insulator transition provides a non-volatilememory effect, which is operable at room temperature.

PSK is perceived by its receptor PSKR3,4, a leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase (LRR-RK). The mechanisms underlying the recognition of PSK, the activation of PSKR and the identity of the components downstream of the initial binding remain elusive. Here we report the crystal structures of the extracellular LRR domain of PSKR in free, PSK-and co-receptor-bound forms. The structures reveal that PSK interacts mainly with a b-strand from the island domain of PSKR, forming an anti-b-sheet. The two sulfate moieties of PSK interact directly with PSKR, sensitizing PSKR recognition of PSK. Supported by biochemical, structural and genetic evidence, PSK binding enhances PSKR heterodimerization with the somatic embryogenesis receptor-like kinases (SERKs). However, PSK is not directly involved in PSKR-SERK interaction but stabilizes PSKR island domain for recruitment of a SERK. Our data reveal the structural basis for PSKR recognition of PSK and allosteric activation of PSKR by PSK, opening up new avenues for the design of PSKR-specific small molecules."], ["Origins of structural and electronic transitions in disordered silicon", "Structurally disordered materials pose fundamental questions(1-4), including how different disordered phases ('polyamorphs') can coexist and transform from one phase to another(5-9). Amorphous silicon has been extensively studied; it forms a fourfold-coordinated, covalent network at ambient conditions and much-higher-coordinated, metallic phases under pressure(10-12). However, a detailed mechanistic understanding of the structural transitions in disordered silicon has been lacking, owing to the intrinsic limitations of even the most advanced experimental and computational techniques, for example, in terms of the system sizes accessible via simulation. Here we show how atomistic machine learning models trained on accurate quantum mechanical computations can help to describe liquid-amorphous and amorphous-amorphous transitions for a system of 100,000 atoms (ten-nanometre length scale), predicting structure, stability and electronic properties. Our simulations reveal a three-step transformation sequence for amorphous silicon under increasing external pressure. First, polyamorphic low- and high-density amorphous regions are found to coexist, rather than appearing sequentially. Then, we observe a structural collapse into a distinct very-high-density amorphous (VHDA) phase. Finally, our simulations indicate the transient nature of this VHDA phase: it rapidly nucleates crystallites, ultimately leading to the formation of a polycrystalline structure, consistent with experiments(13-15) but not seen in earlier simulations(11,16-18). A machine learning model for the electronic density of states confirms the onset of metallicity during VHDA formation and the subsequent crystallization. These results shed light on the liquid and amorphous states of silicon, and, in a wider context, they exemplify a machine learning-driven approach to predictive materials modelling."], ["Migration of plutonium in ground water at the Nevada Test Site", "Mobile colloids-suspended particles in the submicrometre size range-are known to occur naturally in ground water(1,2) and have the potential to enhance transport of non-soluble contaminants through sorption(3). The possible implications of this transport mechanism are of particular concern in the context of radionuclide transport. Significant quantities of the element plutonium have been introduced into the environment as a result of nuclear weapons testing and production, and nuclear power-plant accidents. Moreover, many countries anticipate storing nuclear waste underground. It has been argued that plutonium introduced into the subsurface environment is relatively immobile owing to its low solubility in ground water(4) and strong sorption onto rocks(5). Nonetheless, colloid-facilitated transport of radionuclides has been implicated in field observations(6,7), but unequivocal evidence of subsurface transport is lacking(3,8,9). Moreover, colloid filtration models predict transport over a limited distance resulting in a discrepancy between observed and modelled behaviour(3). Here we report that the radionuclides observed in groundwater samples from aquifers at the Nevada Test Site, where hundreds of underground nuclear tests were conducted, are associated with the colloidal fraction of the ground water. The Pu-240/Pu-239 isotope ratio of the samples establishes that an underground nuclear test 1.3 km north of the sample site is the origin of the plutonium. We argue that colloidal groundwater migration must have played an important role in transporting the plutonium, Models that either predict limited transport or do not allow for colloid-facilitated transport may thus significantly underestimate the extent of radionuclide migration."], ["Polar metals by geometric design", "Gauss's law dictates that the net electric field inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is zero by effective charge screening; free carriers within a metal eliminate internal dipoles that may arise owing to asymmetric charge distributions(1). Quantum physics supports this view(2), demonstrating that delocalized electrons make a static macroscopic polarization, an ill-defined quantity in metals(3)-it is exceedingly unusual to find a polar metal that exhibits long-range ordered dipoles owing to cooperative atomic displacements aligned from dipolar interactions as in insulating phases(4). Here we describe the quantum mechanical design and experimental realization of room-temperature polar metals in thin-film ANiO(3) perovskite nickelates using a strategy based on atomic-scale control of inversion-preserving (centric) displacements(5). We predict with ab initio calculations that cooperative polar A cation displacements are geometrically stabilized with a non-equilibrium amplitude and tilt pattern of the corner-connected NiO6 octahedra-the structural signatures of perovskites-owing to geometric constraints imposed by the underlying substrate. Heteroepitaxial thin-films grown on LaAlO3 (111) substrates fulfil the design principles. We achieve both a conducting polar monoclinic oxide that is inaccessible in compositionally identical films grown on (001) substrates, and observe a hidden, previously unreported(6-10), non-equilibrium structure in thin-film geometries. We expect that the geometric stabilization approach will provide novel avenues for realizing new multifunctional materials with unusual coexisting properties."], ["Nickel-catalysed hydrodimerization of unactivated terminal alkenes", "Site-selective homo- and cross-hydrodimerization of terminal alkenes has remained a long-standing challenge in organic synthesis. Metal-hydride-catalysed selective dimerization, oligomerization or polymerization methods are often limited to electronically biased or small alkene substrates. Here we report the development of a nickel-catalysed protocol that enables selective homo- and cross-dimerization of unactivated linear and sterically congested terminal alkenes to afford linear alkyl\u2012alkyl products in good yields and high linear/branched selectivity. The process is tolerant of a range of functionalities including heteroatoms, saturated heterocycles and bioactive motifs. Mechanistic experiments reveal that the co-oxidants we used, CuBr2 and di-tert-butyl peroxide, probably convert dialkyl\u2012Ni(II) intermediates to the corresponding Ni(III) species through a single-electron-transfer process. This oxidative step avoids decomposition of thermally labile dialkyl\u2012Ni(II) intermediates and promotes the formation of hydrodimerization products by reductive elimination of the Ni(III) complex. Without CuBr2, high branched selectivity was achieved, affording the methyl-branched products\u2014which are typically difficult to synthesize\u2014in good yields."], ["Oxygen sensation and social feeding mediated by a <i>C-elegans</i> guanylate cyclase homologue", "Specialized oxygen-sensing cells in the nervous system generate rapid behavioural responses to oxygen. We show here that the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans exhibits a strong behavioural preference for 5-12% oxygen, avoiding higher and lower oxygen levels. 3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) is a common second messenger in sensory transduction and is implicated in oxygen sensation. Avoidance of high oxygen levels by C. elegans requires the sensory cGMP-gated channel tax-2/tax-4 and a specific soluble guanylate cyclase homologue, gcy-35. The GCY-35 haem domain binds molecular oxygen, unlike the haem domains of classical nitric-oxide-regulated guanylate cyclases. GCY-35 and TAX-4 mediate oxygen sensation in four sensory neurons that control a naturally polymorphic social feeding behaviour in C. elegans. Social feeding and related behaviours occur only when oxygen exceeds C. elegans' preferred level, and require gcy-35 activity. Our results suggest that GCY-35 is regulated by molecular oxygen, and that social feeding can be a behavioural strategy for responding to hyperoxic environments."], ["Excitons and emergent quantum phenomena in stacked 2D semiconductors", "This Review discusses the exciton physics of transition metal dichalcogenides, focusing on moire patterns and exciton many-body physics, and outlines future research directions in the field. The design and control of material interfaces is a foundational approach to realize technologically useful effects and engineer material properties. This is especially true for two-dimensional (2D) materials, where van der Waals stacking allows disparate materials to be freely stacked together to form highly customizable interfaces. This has underpinned a recent wave of discoveries based on excitons in stacked double layers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), the archetypal family of 2D semiconductors. In such double-layer structures, the elegant interplay of charge, spin and moire superlattice structure with many-body effects gives rise to diverse excitonic phenomena and correlated physics. Here we review some of the recent discoveries that highlight the versatility of TMD double layers to explore quantum optics and many-body effects. We identify outstanding challenges in the field and present a roadmap for unlocking the full potential of excitonic physics in TMD double layers and beyond, such as incorporating newly discovered ferroelectric and magnetic materials to engineer symmetries and add a new level of control to these remarkable engineered materials."], ["Thermal-expansion offset for high-performance fuel cell cathodes", "One challenge for the commercial development of solid oxide fuel cells as efficient energy-conversion devices isthermo-mechanical instability. Large internal-strain gradients caused by the mismatch in thermal expansion behaviour between different fuel cell components are the main cause of this instability, which can lead to cell degradation, delamination or fracture(1-4). Here we demonstrate an approach to realizing full thermo-mechanical compatibility between the cathode and other cell components by introducing a thermal-expansion offset. We use reactive sintering to combine a cobalt-based perovskite with high electrochemical activity and large thermal-expansion coefficient with a negative-thermal-expansion material, thus forming a composite electrode with a thermal-expansion behaviour that is well matched to that of the electrolyte. A new interphase is formed because of the limited reaction between the two materials in the composite during the calcination process, which also creates A-site deficiencies in the perovskite. As a result, the composite shows both high activity and excellent stability. The introduction of reactive negative-thermal-expansion components may provide a general strategy for the development of fully compatible and highly active electrodes for solid oxide fuel cells."], ["Ramp compression of diamond to five terapascals", "The recent discovery of more than a thousand planets outside our Solar System(1,2), together with the significant push to achieve inertially confined fusion in the laboratory(3), has prompted a renewed interest in how dense matter behaves at millions to billions of atmospheres of pressure. The theoretical description of such electron-degenerate matter has matured since the early quantum statistical model of Thomas and Fermi(4-10), and now suggests that new complexities can emerge at pressures where core electrons (not only valence electrons) influence the structure and bonding of matter(11). Recent developments in shock-free dynamic (ramp) compression now allow laboratory access to this dense matter regime. Here we describe ramp-compression measurements for diamond, achieving 3.7-fold compression at a peak pressure of 5 terapascals (equivalent to 50 million atmospheres). These equation-of-state data can now be compared to first-principles density functional calculations(12) and theories long used to describe matter present in the interiors of giant planets, in stars, and in inertial-confinement fusion experiments. Our data also provide new constraints on mass-radius relationships for carbon-rich planets."], ["Free-electron lasing at 27 nanometres based on a laser wakefield accelerator", "X-ray free-electron lasers can generate intense and coherent radiation at wavelengths down to the sub-angstrom region(1-5), and have become indispensable tools for applications in structural biology and chemistry, among other disciplines(6). Several X-ray free-electron laser facilities are in operation(2-5); however, their requirement for large, high-cost, state-of-the-art radio-frequency accelerators has led to great interest in the development of compact and economical accelerators. Laser wakefield accelerators can sustain accelerating gradients more than three orders of magnitude higher than those of radio-frequency accelerators(7-10), and are regarded as an attractive option for driving compact X-ray free-electron lasers(11). However, the realization of such devices remains a challenge owing to the relatively poor quality of electron beams that are based on a laser wakefield accelerator. Here we present an experimental demonstration of undulator radiation amplification in the exponential-gain regime by using electron beams based on a laser wakefield accelerator. The amplified undulator radiation, which is typically centred at 27 nanometres and has a maximum photon number of around 1010 per shot, yields a maximum radiation energy of about 150 nanojoules. In the third of three undulators in the device, the maximum gain of the radiation power is approximately 100-fold, confirming a successful operation in the exponential-gain regime. Our results constitute a proof-of-principle demonstration of free-electron lasing using a laser wakefield accelerator, and pave the way towards the development of compact X-ray free-electron lasers based on this technology with broad applications."], ["Single-cell transcriptomics reveals bimodality in expression and splicing in immune cells", "Recent molecular studies have shown that, even when derived from a seemingly homogenous population, individual cells can exhibit substantial differences in gene expression, protein levels and phenotypic output(1-5), with important functional consequences(4,5). Existing studies of cellular heterogeneity, however, have typically measured only a few pre-selected RNAs1,2 or proteins(5,6) simultaneously, because genomic profiling methods(3) could not be applied to single cells until very recently(7-10). Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate heterogeneity in the response of mouse bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) to lipopolysaccharide. We find extensive, and previously unobserved, bimodal variation in messenger RNA abundance and splicing patterns, which we validate by RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization for select transcripts. In particular, hundreds of key immune genes are bimodally expressed across cells, surprisingly even for genes that are very highly expressed at the population average. Moreover, splicing patterns demonstrate previously unobserved levels of heterogeneity between cells. Some of the observed bimodality can be attributed to closely related, yet distinct, known maturity states of BMDCs; other portions reflect differences in the usage of key regulatory circuits. For example, we identify a module of 137 highly variable, yet co-regulated, antiviral response genes. Using cells from knockout mice, we show that variability in this module may be propagated through an interferon feedback circuit, involving the transcriptional regulators Stat2 and Irf7. Our study demonstrates the power and promise of single-cell genomics in uncovering functional diversity between cells and in deciphering cell states and circuits."], ["Large differences in tropical aerosol forcing at the top of the atmosphere and Earth's surface", "The effect of radiative forcing by anthropogenic aerosols is one of the largest sources of uncertainty in climate predictions(1-6). Direct observations of the forcing are therefore needed, particularly for the poorly understood tropical aerosols. Here we present an observational method for quantifying aerosol forcing to within +/-5 per cent. We use calibrated satellite radiation measurements and five independent surface radiometers to quantify the aerosol forcing simultaneously at the Earth's surface and the top of the atmosphere over the tropical northern Indian Ocean. In winter, this region is covered by anthropogenic aerosols of sulphate, nitrate, organics, soot and fly ash from the south Asian continent(7,8). Accordingly, mean clear-sky solar radiative heating for the winters of 1998 and 1999 decreased at the ocean surface by 12 to 30 W m(-2), but only by 4 to 10 W m(-2) at the top of the atmosphere. This threefold difference (due largely to solar absorption by soot) and the large magnitude of the observed surface forcing both imply that tropical aerosols might slow down the hydrological cycle."], ["The most incompressible metal osmium at static pressures above 750 gigapascals", "Metallic osmium (Os) is one of the most exceptional elemental materials, having, at ambient pressure, the highest known density and one of the highest cohesive energies and melting temperatures(1). It is also very incompressible(2-4), but its high-pressure behaviour is not well understood because it has been studied(2-6) so far only at pressures below 75 gigapascals. Here we report powder X-ray diffraction measurements on Os at multi-megabar pressures using both conventional and double-stage diamond anvil cells(7), with accurate pressure determination ensured by first obtaining self-consistent equations of state of gold, platinum, and tungsten in static experiments up to 500 gigapascals. These measurements allow us to show that Os retains its hexagonal close-packed structure upon compression to over 770 gigapascals. But although its molar volume monotonically decreases with pressure, the unit cell parameter ratio of Os exhibits anomalies at approximately 150 gigapascals and 440 gigapascals. Dynamical mean-field theory calculations suggest that the former anomaly is a signature of the topological change of the Fermi surface for valence electrons. However, the anomaly at 440 gigapascals might be related to an electronic transition associated with pressure-induced interactions between core electrons. The ability to affect the core electrons under static high-pressure experimental conditions, even for incompressible metals such as Os, opens up opportunities to search for new states of matter under extreme compression."], ["Two-photon polymerization initiators for three-dimensional optical data storage and microfabrication", "Two-photon excitation provides a means of activating chemical or physical processes with high spatial resolution in three dimensions and has made possible the development of three-dimensional fluorescence imaging(1), optical data storage(2,3) and lithographic microfabrication(4-6). These applications take advantage of the fact that the two-photon absorption probability depends quadratically on intensity, so under tight-focusing conditions, the absorption is confined at the focus to a volume of order lambda(3) (where lambda is the laser wavelength). Any subsequent process, such as fluorescence or a photoinduced chemical reaction, is also localized in this small volume. Although three-dimensional data storage and microfabrication have been illustrated using two-photon-initiated polymerization of resins incorporating conventional ultraviolet-absorbing initiators, such photopolymer systems exhibit low photosensitivity as the initiators have small two-photon absorption cross-sections (delta). Consequently, this approach requires high laser power, and its widespread use remains impractical. Here we report on a class of pi-conjugated compounds that exhibit large delta (as high as 1,250 x 10(-50) cm(4) s per photon) and enhanced two-photon sensitivity relative to ultraviolet initiators. Two-photon excitable resins based on these new initiators have been developed and used to demonstrate a scheme for three-dimensional data storage which permits fluorescent and refractive read-out, and the fabrication of three-dimensional micro-optical and micromechanical structures, including photonic-bandgap-type structures(7)."], ["BRI1 is a critical component of a plasma-membrane receptor for plant steroids", "Most multicellular organisms use steroids as signalling molecules for physiological and developmental regulation. Two different modes of steroid action have been described in animal systems: the well-studied gene regulation response mediated by nuclear receptors(1,2), and the rapid non-genomic responses mediated by proposed membrane-bound receptors(3,4). Plant genomes do not seem to encode members of the nuclear receptor superfamily(5). However, a transmembrane receptor kinase, brassinosteroid-insensitive1 (BRI1), has been implicated in brassinosteroid-responses(6,7). Here we show that BRI1 functions as a receptor of brassinolide, the most active brassinosteroid. The number of brassinolide-binding sites and the degree of response to brassinolide depend on the level of BRI1 protein. The brassinolide-binding activity co-immunoprecipitates with BRI1, and requires a functional BRI1 extracellular domain. Moreover, treatment of Arabidopsis seedlings with brassinolide induces autophosphorylation of BRI1, which, together with our binding studies, shows that BRI1 is a receptor kinase that transduces steroid signals across the plasma membrane."], ["Nanofabricated media with negative permeability at visible frequencies", "A great deal of attention has recently been focused on a new class of smart materials-so-called left-handed media-that exhibit highly unusual electromagnetic properties and promise new device applications(1-6). Left-handed materials require negative permeability m, an extreme condition that has so far been achieved only for frequencies in the microwave to terahertz range(7-11). Extension of the approach described in ref. 7 to achieve the necessary high-frequency magnetic response in visible optics presents a formidable challenge(12-15), as no material-natural or artificial-is known to exhibit any magnetism at these frequencies. Here we report a nanofabricated medium consisting of electromagnetically coupled pairs of gold dots with geometry carefully designed at a 10-nm level. The medium exhibits a strong magnetic response at visible-light frequencies, including a band with negative m. The magnetism arises owing to the excitation of an antisymmetric plasmon resonance. The high-frequency permeability qualitatively reveals itself via optical impedance matching. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of engineering magnetism at visible frequencies and pave the way towards magnetic and left-handed components for visible optics."], ["Recognition of hemi-methylated DNA by the SRA protein UHRF1 by a base-flipping mechanism", "DNA methylation of CpG dinucleotides is an important epigenetic modification of mammalian genomes and is essential for the regulation of chromatin structure, of gene expression and of genome stability(1,2). Differences in DNA methylation patterns underlie a wide range of biological processes, such as genomic imprinting, inactivation of the X chromosome, embryogenesis, and carcinogenesis(3-6). Inheritance of the epigenetic methylation pattern is mediated by the enzyme DNA methyltransferase 1 ( Dnmt1), which methylates newly synthesized CpG sequences during DNA replication, depending on the methylation status of the template strands(7,8). The protein UHRF1 ( also known as Np95 and ICBP90) recognizes hemi- methylation sites via a SET and RING- associated ( SRA) domain and directs Dnmt1 to these sites(9-11). Here we report the crystal structures of the SRA domain in free and hemi- methylated DNA- bound states. The SRA domain folds into a globular structure with a basic concave surface formed by highly conserved residues. Binding of DNA to the concave surface causes a loop and an amino- terminal tail of the SRA domain to fold into DNA interfaces at the major and minor grooves of the methylation site. In contrast to fully methylated CpG sites recognized by the methyl- CpG- binding domain(12,13), the methylcytosine base at the hemi- methylated site is flipped out of the DNA helix in the SRA - DNA complex and fits tightly into a protein pocket on the concave surface. The complex structure suggests that the successive flip out of the pre- existing methylated cytosine and the target cytosine to be methylated is associated with the coordinated transfer of the hemi- methylated CpG site from UHRF1 to Dnmt1."], ["Structure and mechanism of the tRNA-dependent lantibiotic dehydratase NisB", "Lantibiotics are a class of peptide antibiotics that contain one or more thioether bonds. The lantibiotic nisin is an antimicrobial peptide that is widely used as a food preservative to combat food-borne pathogens(1). Nisin contains dehydroalanine and dehydrobutyrine residues that are formed by the dehydration of Ser/Thr by the lantibiotic dehydratase NisB (ref. 2). Recent biochemical studies revealed that NisB glutamylates Ser/Thr side chains as part of the dehydration process'. However, the molecular mechanism by which NisB uses glutamate to catalyse dehydration remains unresolved. Here we show that this process involves Outamyl-tRNA(Glu) to activate Ser/Thr residues. In addition, the 2.9-angstrom crystal structure of NisB in complex with its substrate peptide NisA reveals the presence of two separate domains that catalyse the Ser/Thr glutamylation and glutamate elimination steps. The co-crystal structure also provides insights into substrate recognition by lantibiotic dehydratases. Our findings demonstrate an unexpected role for aminoacyl-tRNA in the formation of dehydroamino acids in lantibiotics, and serve as a basis for the functional characterization of the many lantibiotic-like dehydratases involved in the biosynthesis of other classes of natural products.

Mice that lack caspase-8 display MLKL-dependent embryonic lethality(4), as do mice that express catalytically inactive CASP8(C362A)(5). Casp8(C362A/C362A)Mlkl(-/-) mice die during the perinatal period(5), whereas Casp8(-/-)Mlkl(-/-) mice are viable(4), which indicates that inactive caspase-8 also has a pro-death scaffolding function. Here we show that mutant CASP8(C362A) induces the formation of ASC (also known as PYCARD) specks, and caspase-1-dependent cleavage of GSDMD and caspases 3 and 7 in MLKL-deficient mouse intestines around embryonic day 18. Caspase-1 and its adaptor ASC contributed to the perinatal lethal phenotype because a number of Casp8(C362A/C362A)Mlkl(-/-)Casp1(-/-) and Casp8(C362A/C362A)Mlkl(-/-)Asc(-/-) mice survived beyond weaning. Transfection studies suggest that inactive caspase-8 adopts a distinct conformation to active caspase-8, enabling its prodomain to engage ASC. Upregulation of the lipopolysaccharide sensor caspase-11 in the intestines of both Casp8(C362A/C362A)Mlkl(-/-) and Casp8(C362A/C362A)Mlkl(-/-)Casp1(-/-) mice also contributed to lethality because Casp8(C362A/C362A)Mlkl(-/-)Casp1(-/-)Casp11(-/-) (Casp11 is also known as Casp4) neonates survived more often than Casp8(C362A/C362A)Mlkl(-/-)Casp1(-/-) neonates. Finally, Casp8(C362A/C362A)Ripk3(-/-)Casp1(-/-)Casp11(-/-) mice survived longer than Casp8(C362A/C362A)Mlkl(-/-)Casp1(-/-)Casp11(-/-) mice, indicating that a necroptosis-independent function of RIPK3 also contributes to lethality. Thus, unanticipated plasticity in death pathways is revealed when caspase-8-dependent apoptosis and MLKL-dependent necroptosis are inhibited."], ["Controlling protein assembly on inorganic crystals through designed protein interfaces", "The ability of proteins and other macromolecules to interact with inorganic surfaces is essential to biological function. The proteins involved in these interactions are highly charged and often rich in carboxylic acid side chains(1-5), but the structures of most protein-inorganic interfaces are unknown. We explored the possibility of systematically designing structured protein-mineral interfaces, guided by the example of ice-binding proteins, which present arrays of threonine residues (matched to the ice lattice) that order clathrate waters into an ice-like structure(6). Here we design proteins displaying arrays of up to 54 carboxylate residues geometrically matched to the potassium ion (K+) sublattice on muscovite mica (001). At low K+ concentration, individual molecules bind independently to mica in the designed orientations, whereas at high K+ concentration, the designs form two-dimensional liquid-crystal phases, which accentuate the inherent structural bias in the muscovite lattice to produce protein arrays ordered over tens of millimetres. Incorporation of designed protein-protein interactions preserving the match between the proteins and the K+ lattice led to extended self-assembled structures on mica: designed end-to-end interactions produced micrometre-long single-protein-diameter wires and a designed trimeric interface yielded extensive honeycomb arrays. The nearest-neighbour distances in these hexagonal arrays could be set digitally between 7.5 and 15.9 nanometres with 2.1-nanometre selectivity by changing the number of repeat units in the monomer. These results demonstrate that protein-inorganic lattice interactions can be systematically programmed and set the stage for designing protein-inorganic hybrid materials."], ["Potential for large-scale CO<sub>2</sub> removal via enhanced rock weathering with croplands", "Enhanced silicate rock weathering (ERW), deployable with croplands, has potential use for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) removal (CDR), which is now necessary to mitigate anthropogenic climate change(1). ERW also has possible co-benefits for improved food and soil security, and reduced ocean acidification(2-4). Here we use an integrated performance modelling approach to make an initial techno-economic assessment for 2050, quantifying how CDR potential and costs vary among nations in relation to business-as-usual energy policies and policies consistent with limiting future warming to 2 degrees Celsius(5). China, India, the USA and Brazil have great potential to help achieve average global CDR goals of 0.5 to 2gigatonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year with extraction costs of approximately US$80-180 per tonne of CO2. These goals and costs are robust, regardless of future energy policies. Deployment within existing croplands offers opportunities to align agriculture and climate policy. However, success will depend upon overcoming political and social inertia to develop regulatory and incentive frameworks. We discuss the challenges and opportunities of ERW deployment, including the potential for excess industrial silicate materials (basalt mine overburden, concrete, and iron and steel slag) to obviate the need for new mining, as well as uncertainties in soil weathering rates and land-ocean transfer of weathered products."], ["Analyses of pig genomes provide insight into porcine demography and evolution", "For 10,000 years pigs and humans have shared a close and complex relationship. From domestication to modern breeding practices, humans have shaped the genomes of domestic pigs. Here we present the assembly and analysis of the genome sequence of a female domestic Duroc pig (Sus scrofa) and a comparison with the genomes of wild and domestic pigs from Europe and Asia. Wild pigs emerged in South East Asia and subsequently spread across Eurasia. Our results reveal a deep phylogenetic split between European and Asian wild boars similar to 1 million years ago, and a selective sweep analysis indicates selection on genes involved in RNA processing and regulation. Genes associated with immune response and olfaction exhibit fast evolution. Pigs have the largest repertoire of functional olfactory receptor genes, reflecting the importance of smell in this scavenging animal. The pig genome sequence provides an important resource for further improvements of this important livestock species, and our identification of many putative disease-causing variants extends the potential of the pig as a biomedical model."], ["Molecular-scale evidence of aerosol particle formation via sequential addition of HIO<sub>3</sub>", "Homogeneous nucleation and subsequent cluster growth leads to the formation of new aerosol particles in the atmosphere(1). The nucleation of sulfuric acid and organic vapours is thought to be responsible for the formation of new particles over continents(1,2), whereas iodine oxide vapours have been implicated in particle formation over coastal regions(3-7). The molecular clustering pathways that are involved in atmospheric particle formation have been elucidated in controlled laboratory studies of chemically simple systems(2,8-10), but direct molecular-level observations of nucleation in atmospheric field conditions that involve sulfuric acid, organic or iodine oxide vapours have yet to be reported(11). Here we present field data from Mace Head, Ireland, and supporting data from northern Greenland and Queen Maud Land, Antarctica, that enable us to identify the molecular steps involved in new particle formation in an iodine-rich, coastal atmospheric environment. We find that the formation and initial growth process is almost exclusively driven by iodine oxoacids and iodine oxide vapours, with average oxygen-to-iodine ratios of 2.4 found in the clusters. On the basis of this high ratio, together with the high concentrations of iodic acid (HIO3) observed, we suggest that cluster formation primarily proceeds by sequential addition of HIO3, followed by intracluster restructuring to I2O5 and recycling of water either in the atmosphere or on dehydration. Our study provides ambient atmospheric molecular-level observations of nucleation, supporting the previously suggested role of iodine-containing species in the formation of new aerosol particles(3-7,12-18), and identifies the key nucleating compound."], ["Catalyst support effects on hydrogen spillover", "Hydrogen spillover(1) is the surface migration of activated hydrogen atoms from a metal catalyst particle, on which they are generated, onto the catalyst support(2). The phenomenon has been much studied(3-7) and its occurrence on reducible supports such as titanium oxide is established, yet questions remain about whether hydrogen spillover can take place on nonreducible supports such as aluminium oxide(8-13). Here we use the enhanced precision of top-down nanofabrication(14,15) to prepare controlled and precisely tunable model systems that allow us to quantify the efficiency and spatial extent of hydrogen spillover on both reducible and nonreducible supports. We place multiple pairs of iron oxide and platinum nanoparticles on titanium oxide and aluminium oxide supports, varying the distance between the pairs from zero to 45 nanometres with a precision of one nanometre. We then observe the extent of the reduction of the iron oxide particles by hydrogen atoms generated on the platinum using single-particle in situ X-ray absorption spectromicroscopy(14) applied simultaneously to all particle pairs. The data, in conjunction with density functional theory calculations(16,17), reveal fast hydrogen spillover on titanium oxide that reduces remote iron oxide nanoparticles via coupled proton-electron transfer. In contrast, spillover on aluminium oxide is mediated by three-coordinated aluminium centres that also interact with water and that give rise to hydrogen mobility competing with hydrogen desorption; this results in hydrogen spillover about ten orders of magnitude slower than on titanium oxide and restricted to very short distances from the platinum particle. We anticipate that these observations will improve our understanding of hydrogen storage(18,19) and catalytic reactions involving hydrogen(8,11-13), and that our approach to creating and probing model catalyst systems will provide opportunities for studying the origin of synergistic effects in supported catalysts that combine multiple functionalities."], ["Unlocking the potential of cation-disordered oxides for rechargeable lithium", "Nearly all high\u2013energy density cathodes for rechargeable lithium batteries are well-ordered materials in which lithium and other cations occupy distinct sites. Cation-disordered materials are generally disregarded as cathodes because lithium diffusion tends to be limited by their structures. The performance of Li1.211Mo0.467Cr0.3O2 shows that lithium diffusion can be facile in disordered materials. Using ab initio computations, we demonstrate that this unexpected behavior is due to percolation of a certain type of active diffusion channels in disordered Li-excess materials. A unified understanding of high performance in both layered and Li-excess materials may enable the design of disordered-electrode materials with high capacity and high energy density."], ["Measurement of the Casimir torque", "Intermolecular forces are pervasive in nature and give rise to various phenomena including surface wetting(1), adhesive forces in biology(2,3), and the Casimir effect(4), which causes two charge-neutral, metal objects in vacuum to attract each other. These interactions are the result of quantum fluctuations of electromagnetic waves and the boundary conditions imposed by the interacting materials. When the materials are optically anisotropic, different polarizations of light experience different refractive indices and a torque is expected to occur that causes the materials to rotate to a position of minimum energy(5,6). Although predicted more than four decades ago, the small magnitude of the Casimir torque has so far prevented direct measurements of it. Here we experimentally measure the Casimir torque between two optically anisotropic materials-a solid birefringent crystal (calcite, lithium niobite, rutile or yttrium vanadate) and a liquid crystal (5CB). We control the sign and strength of the torque, and its dependence on the rotation angle and the separation distance between the materials, through the choice of materials. The values that we measure agree with calculations, verifying the long-standing prediction that a mechanical torque induced by quantum fluctuations can exist between two separated objects. These results open the door to using the Casimir torque as a micro- or nanoscale actuation mechanism, which would be relevant for a range of technologies, including microelectromechanical systems and liquid crystals."], ["SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF CARBIDE NANORODS", "THE properties and potential applications of carbon nanotubes filled with other materials have aroused much speculation(1-5).

Here we report an alternative approach to the synthesis of nanoscale structures based on nanotubes, in which the tubes are converted to carbide rods by reaction with volatile oxide and/or halide species. In this way we have been able to prepare solid carbide nanoscale rods of TiC, NbC, Fe3C, SiC and BCx in high yield with typical diameters of between 2 and 30 nm and lengths of up to 20 mu m. Preliminary studies show that these rods share the properties of the bulk materials (such as magnetism and superconductivity), suggesting that they might allow the investigation of the effects of confinement and reduced dimensionality on such solid-state properties.

The hydrogen atom is considered to be an ideal coupling handle, owing to its relative abundance in organic molecules and its availability for functionalization at almost any stage in a synthetic sequence1. Although many C-H functionalization reactions involve C(sp(3))-C(sp(2)) coupling, there is a growing demand for C-H alkylation reactions, wherein sp(3) C-H bonds are replaced with sp(3) C-alkyl groups. Here we describe a polarity-match-based selective sp(3) C-H alkylation via the combination of photoredox, nickel and hydrogen-atom transfer catalysis. This methodology simultaneously uses three catalytic cycles to achieve hydridic C-H bond abstraction (enabled by polarity matching), alkyl halide oxidative addition, and reductive elimination to enable alkyl-alkyl fragment coupling. The sp(3) C-H alkylation is highly selective for the alpha-C-H of amines, ethers and sulphides, which are commonly found in pharmaceutically relevant architectures.

In contrast to a Li3MCl6 (M = Y, In, Sc and Ho) electrolyte lattice(3-6), the UCl3-type LaCl3 lattice has large, one-dimensional channels for rapid Li+ conduction, interconnected by La vacancies via Ta doping and resulting in a three-dimensional Li+ migration network. The optimized Li0.388Ta0.238La0.475Cl3 electrolyte exhibits Li+ conductivity of 3.02mScm(-1) at 30 degrees C and a low activation energy of 0.197eV. It also generates a gradient interfacial passivation layer to stabilize the Li metal electrode for long-term cycling of a Li-Li symmetric cell (1mAhcm(-2)) for more than 5,000h. When directly coupled with an uncoated LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathode and bare Li metal anode, the Li0.388Ta0.238La0.475Cl3 electrolyte enables a solid battery to run for more than 100cycles with a cutoff voltage of 4.35V and areal capacity of more than 1mAhcm(-2). We also demonstrate rapid Li+ conduction in lanthanide metal chlorides (LnCl(3); Ln = La, Ce, Nd, Sm and Gd), suggesting that the LnCl(3) solid electrolyte system could provide further developments in conductivity and utility. A LaCl3-based lithium superionic conductor is developed that has excellent interfacial compatibility with lithium metal electrodes, with its optimized Li0.388Ta0.238La0.475Cl3 electrolyte exhibiting good Li+ conductivity and low activation energy."], ["The innate immunity protein IFITM3 modulates \u03b3-secretase in Alzheimer's disease", "The IFITM3 innate immunity protein directly binds presenilin near the active site and upregulates gamma-secretase activity and the production of amyloid-beta, and IFITM3 is upregulated in patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Innate immunity is associated with Alzheimer's disease(1), but the influence of immune activation on the production of amyloid-beta is unknown(2,3). Here we identify interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) as a gamma-secretase modulatory protein, and establish a mechanism by which inflammation affects the generation of amyloid-beta. Inflammatory cytokines induce the expression of IFITM3 in neurons and astrocytes, which binds to gamma-secretase and upregulates its activity, thereby increasing the production of amyloid-beta. The expression of IFITM3 is increased with ageing and in mouse models that express familial Alzheimer's disease genes. Furthermore, knockout of IFITM3 reduces gamma-secretase activity and the formation of amyloid plaques in a transgenic mouse model (5xFAD) of early amyloid deposition. IFITM3 protein is upregulated in tissue samples from a subset of patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease that exhibit higher gamma-secretase activity. The amount of IFITM3 in the gamma-secretase complex has a strong and positive correlation with gamma-secretase activity in samples from patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease. These findings reveal a mechanism in which gamma-secretase is modulated by neuroinflammation via IFITM3 and the risk of Alzheimer's disease is thereby increased."], ["A quantized microwave quadrupole insulator with topologically protected corner states", "The theory of electric polarization in crystals defines the dipole moment of an insulator in terms of a Berry phase (geometric phase) associated with its electronic ground state(1,2). This concept not only solves the long-standing puzzle of how to calculate dipole moments in crystals, but also explains topological band structures in insulators and superconductors, including the quantum anomalous Hall insulator(3,4) and the quantum spin Hall insulator(5-7), as well as quantized adiabatic pumping processes(8-10). A recent theoretical study has extended the Berry phase framework to also account for higher electric multipole moments(11), revealing the existence of higher-order topological phases that have not previously been observed. Here we demonstrate experimentally a member of this predicted class of materials-a quantized quadrupole topological insulator-produced using a gigahertz-frequency reconfigurable microwave circuit. We confirm the non-trivial topological phase using spectroscopic measurements and by identifying corner states that result from the bulk topology. In addition, we test the critical prediction that these corner states are protected by the topology of the bulk, and are not due to surface artefacts, by deforming the edges of the crystal lattice from the topological to the trivial regime. Our results provide conclusive evidence of a unique form of robustness against disorder and deformation, which is characteristic of higher-order topological insulators."], ["TITANIUM-CONTAINING MESOPOROUS MOLECULAR-SIEVES FOR CATALYTIC-OXIDATION OF AROMATIC-COMPOUNDS", "TITANIUM silicalite is an effective molecular-sieve catalyst for the selective oxidation of alkanes, the hydroxylation of phenol and the epoxidation of alkenes in the presence of H2O2 (refs 1-3). The range of organic compounds that can be oxidized is greatly limited, however, by the relatively small pore size (about 0.6 nm) of the host framework(4). Large-pore (mesoporous) silica-based molecular sieves have been prepared recently by Kresge et al.(5-7) and Kuroda et al.(8); the former used a templating approach in which the formation of an inorganic mesoporous structure is assisted by self-organization of surfactants, and the latter involved topochemical rearrangement of a layered silica precursor. Here we describe the use of the templating approach to synthesize mesoporous silica-based molecular sieves partly substituted with titanium-large-pore analogues of titanium silicalite. We find that these materials show selective catalytic activity towards the oxidation of 2,6-di-tert-butyl phenol to the corresponding quinone and the conversion of benzene to phenol."], ["INHIBITION OF TELOMERASE BY G-QUARTET DNA STRUCTURES", "THE ends or telomeres of the linear chromosomes of eukaryotes are composed of tandem repeats of short DNA sequences, one strand being rich in guanine (G strand) and the complementary strand in cytosine 1,2. Telomere synthesis involves the addition of telomeric repeats to the G strand by telomere terminal transferase (telomerase) 3-6. Telomeric G-strand DNAs from a variety of organisms adopt compact structures 7, the most stable of which is explained by the formation of G-quartets 8,9. Here we investigate the capacity of the different folded forms of telomeric DNA to serve as primers for the Oxytricha nova telomerase in vitro. Formation of the K+-stabilized G-quartet structure in a primer inhibits its use by telomerase. Furthermore, the octanucleotide T4G4, which does not fold, is a better primer than (T4G4)2, which can form a foldback structure 7-10. We conclude that telomerase does not require any folding of its DNA primer. Folding of telomeric DNA into G-quartet structures seems to influence the extent of telomere elongation in vitro and might therefore act as a negative regulator of elongation in vivo."], ["Colossal magnetoresistance in Cr-based chalcogenide spinels", "Manganese oxides with a perovskite structure' exhibit a transition between a paramagnetic insulating phase and a ferromagnetic metal phase. Associated with this transition is an effect known as colossal magnetoresistance(2-5) (CMR)-in the vicinity of the transition temperature, the materials exhibit a large change in resistance in response to an applied magnetic field. Such an effect, if optimized, might find potential application in magnetic devices. But the criteria for achieving (and hence optimizing) CMR are not clear, presenting a challenge for materials scientists, The accepted description of CMR in the manganite perovskites invokes the 'double-exchange' mechanism, whereby charge transport is enhanced by the magnetic alignment of neighbouring Mn ions of different valence configuration (Mn3+ and Mn4+), and inhibited by the formation of charge-induced localized lattice distortions(6,7) Here we report the existence of a large magnetoresistive effect in a class of materials-Cr-based chalcogenide spinels-that do not possess heterovalency, distortion-inducing ions, manganese, oxygen or a perovskite structure. The realization of CMR in compounds having a spinel structure should open up a vast range of materials for the further exploration and exploitation of this effect."], ["Structural insight into substrate preference for TET- mediated oxidation", "DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification(1-3). Ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins are involved in DNA demethylation through iteratively oxidizing 5-methylcytosine (5mC) into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC)(4-8). Here we show that human TET1 and TET2 are more active on 5mC-DNA than 5hmC/5fC-DNA substrates. We determine the crystal structures of TET2-5hmC-DNA and TET2-5fC-DNA complexes at 1.80 angstrom and 1.97 angstrom resolution, respectively. The cytosine portion of 5hmC/5fC is specifically recognized by TET2 in a manner similar to that of 5mC in the TET2-5mC-DNA structure(9), and the pyrimidine base of 5mC/5hmC/5fC adopts an almost identical conformation within the catalytic cavity. However, the hydroxyl group of 5hmC and carbonyl group of 5fC face towards the opposite direction because the hydroxymethyl group of 5hmC and formyl group of 5fC adopt restrained conformations through forming hydrogen bonds with the 1-carboxylate of NOG and N4 exocyclic nitrogen of cytosine, respectively. Biochemical analyses indicate that the substrate preference of TET2 results from the different efficiencies of hydrogen abstraction in TET2-mediated oxidation. The restrained conformation of 5hmC and 5fC within the catalytic cavity may prevent their abstractable hydrogen(s) adopting a favourable orientation for hydrogen abstraction and thus result in low catalytic efficiency. Our studies demonstrate that the substrate preference of TET2 results from the intrinsic value of its substrates at their 5mC derivative groups and suggest that 5hmC is relatively stable and less prone to further oxidation by TET proteins. Therefore, TET proteins are evolutionarily tuned to be less reactive towards 5hmC and facilitate the generation of 5hmC as a potentially stable mark for regulatory functions."], ["X-ray analysis on the nanogram to microgram scale using porous complexes", "X-ray single-crystal diffraction (SCD) analysis has the intrinsic limitation that the target molecules must be obtained as single crystals. Here we report a protocol for SCD analysis that does not require the crystallization of the sample. In our method, tiny crystals of porous complexes are soaked in a solution of the target, such that the complexes can absorb the target molecules. Crystallographic analysis clearly determines the absorbed guest structures along with the host frameworks. Because the SCD analysis is carried out on only one tiny crystal of the complex, the required sample mass is of the nanogram-microgram order. We demonstrate that as little as about 80 nanograms of a sample is enough for the SCD analysis. In combination with high-performance liquid chromatography, our protocol allows the direct characterization of multiple fractions, establishing a prototypical means of liquid chromatography SCD analysis. Furthermore, we unambiguously determined the structure of a scarce marine natural product using only 5 micrograms of the compound."], ["Structural basis for the inhibition of bacterial multidrug exporters", "The multidrug efflux transporter AcrB and its homologues are important in the multidrug resistance of Gram-negative pathogens(1,2). However, despite efforts to develop efflux inhibitors(3), clinically useful inhibitors are not available at present(4,5). Pyridopyrimidine derivatives are AcrB- and MexB-specific inhibitors that do not inhibit MexY(6,7); MexB and MexY are principal multidrug exporters in Pseudomonas aeruginosa(8-10). We have previously determined the crystal structure of AcrB in the absence and presence of antibiotics(11-13). Drugs were shown to be exported by a functionally rotating mechanism(12) through tandem proximal and distal multisite drug-binding pockets(13). Here we describe the first inhibitor-bound structures of AcrB and MexB, in which these proteins are bound by a pyridopyrimidine derivative. The pyridopyrimidine derivative binds tightly to a narrow pit composed of a phenylalanine cluster located in the distal pocket and sterically hinders the functional rotation. This pit is a hydrophobic trap that branches off from the substrate-translocation channel. Phe 178 is located at the edge of this trap in AcrB and MexB and contributes to the tight binding of the inhibitor molecule through a pi-pi interaction with the pyridopyrimidine ring. The voluminous side chain of Trp 177 located at the corresponding position in MexY prevents inhibitor binding. The structure of the hydrophobic trap described in this study will contribute to the development of universal inhibitors of MexB and MexY in P. aeruginosa."], ["Molecular robots guided by prescriptive landscapes", "Traditional robots(1) rely for their function on computing, to store internal representations of their goals and environment and to coordinate sensing and any actuation of components required in response. Moving robotics to the single-molecule level is possible in principle, but requires facing the limited ability of individual molecules to store complex information and programs. One strategy to overcome this problem is to use systems that can obtain complex behaviour from the interaction of simple robots with their environment(2-4). A first step in this direction was the development of DNA walkers(5), which have developed from being non-autonomous(6,7) to being capable of directed but brief motion on one-dimensional tracks(8-11). Here we demonstrate that previously developed random walkers(12)-so-called molecular spiders that comprise a streptavidin molecule as an inert 'body' and three deoxyribozymes as catalytic 'legs'-show elementary robotic behaviour when interacting with a precisely defined environment. Single-molecule microscopy observations confirm that such walkers achieve directional movement by sensing and modifying tracks of substrate molecules laid out on a two-dimensional DNA origami landscape(13). When using appropriately designed DNA origami, the molecular spiders autonomously carry out sequences of actions such as 'start', 'follow', 'turn' and 'stop'. We anticipate that this strategy will result in more complex robotic behaviour at the molecular level if additional control mechanisms are incorporated. One example might be interactions between multiple molecular robots leading to collective behaviour(14,15); another might be the ability to read and transform secondary cues on the DNA origami landscape as a means of implementing Turing-universal algorithmic behaviour(2,16,17)."], ["Associating HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein structures with states on the virus observed by smFRET", "The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer mediates cell entry and is conformationally dynamic(1-8.) Imaging by single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) has revealed that, on the surface of intact virions, mature pre-fusion Env transitions from a pre-triggered conformation (state 1) through a default intermediate conformation (state 2) to a conformation in which it is bound to three CD4 receptor molecules (state 3)(8-10). It is currently unclear how these states relate to known structures. Breakthroughs in the structural characterization of the HIV-1 Env trimer have previously been achieved by generating soluble and proteolytically cleaved trimers of gp140 Env that are stabilized by a disulfide bond, an isoleucine-to-proline substitution at residue 559 and a truncation at residue 664 (SOSIP. 664 trimers)(5,11-18). Cryo-electron microscopy studies have been performed with C-terminally truncated Env of the HIV-1(JR-FL) strain in complex with the antibody PGT151(19). Both approaches have revealed similar structures for Env. Although these structures have been presumed to represent the pre-triggered state 1 of HIV-1 Env, this hypothesis has never directly been tested. Here we use smFRET to compare the conformational states of Env trimers used for structural studies with native Env on intact virus. We find that the constructs upon which extant high-resolution structures are based predominantly occupy downstream conformations that represent states 2 and 3. Therefore, the structure of the pretriggered state-1 conformation of viral Env that has been identified by smFRET and that is preferentially stabilized by many broadly neutralizing antibodies-and thus of interest for the design of immunogens-remains unknown."], ["Magnetic edge states and coherent manipulation of graphene nanoribbons", "Graphene, a single-layer network of carbon atoms, has outstanding electrical and mechanical properties(1). Graphene ribbons with nanometre-scale widths(2,3) (nanoribbons) should exhibit half-metallicity(4) and quantum confinement. Magnetic edges in graphene nanoribbons(5,6) have been studied extensively from a theoretical standpoint because their coherent manipulation would be a milestone for spintronic(7) and quantum computing devices(8). However, experimental investigations have been hampered because nanoribbon edges cannot be produced with atomic precision and the graphene terminations that have been proposed are chemically unstable(9). Here we address both of these problems, by using molecular graphene nanoribbons functionalized with stable spin-bearing radical groups. We observe the predicted delocalized magnetic edge states and test theoretical models of the spin dynamics and spin-environment interactions. Comparison with a non-graphitized reference material enables us to clearly identify the characteristic behaviour of the radical-functionalized graphene nanoribbons. We quantify the parameters of spin-orbit coupling, define the interaction patterns and determine the spin decoherence channels. Even without any optimization, the spin coherence time is in the range of microseconds at room temperature, and we perform quantum inversion operations between edge and radical spins. Our approach provides a way of testing the theory of magnetism in graphene nanoribbons experimentally. The coherence times that we observe open up encouraging prospects for the use of magnetic nanoribbons in quantum spintronic devices."], ["Lithium-doped plastic crystal electrolytes exhibiting fast ion conduction for secondary batteries", "Rechargeable lithium batteries have long been considered an attractive alternative power source for a wide variety of applications. Safety and stability(1) concerns associated with solvent-based electrolytes has necessitated the use of lithium intercalation materials (rather than lithium metal) as anodes, which decreases the energy storage capacity per unit mass. The use of solid lithium ion conductors-based on glasses, ceramics or polymers-as the electrolyte would potentially improve the stability of a lithium-metal anode while alleviating the safety concerns. Glasses and ceramics conduct via a fast ion mechanism, in which the lithium ions move within an essentially static framework. In contrast, the motion of ions in polymer systems is similar to that in solvent-based electrolytes-motion is mediated by the dynamics of the host polymer, thereby restricting the conductivity to relatively low values, Moreover, in the polymer systems, the motion of the lithium ions provides only a small fraction of the overall conductivity(2), which results in severe concentration gradients during cell operation, causing premature failure(3). Here we describe a class of materials, prepared by doping lithium ions into a plastic crystalline matrix, that exhibit fast lithium ion motion due to rotational disorder and the existence of vacancies in the lattice. The combination of possible structural variations of the plastic crystal matrix and conductivities as high as 2 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) at 60 degrees C make these materials very attractive for secondary battery applications."], ["Fracture, fatigue, and friction of polymers in which entanglements greatly outnumber cross-links", "In gels and elastomers, the role of entanglements on deformation has been studied, but their effects on fracture, fatigue, and friction are less well understood. In this study, we synthesized polymers in which entanglements greatly outnumber cross-links. The dense entanglements enable transmission of tension in a polymer chain along its length and to many other chains. The sparse cross-links prevent the polymer chains from disentangling. These polymers have high toughness, strength, and fatigue resistance. After submersion in water, the polymers swell to equilibrium, and the resulting hydrogels have low hysteresis, low friction, and high wear resistance."], ["RAF inhibitors transactivate RAF dimers and ERK signalling in cells with wild-type BRAF", "Tumours with mutant BRAF are dependent on the RAF-MEK-ERK signalling pathway for their growth(1-3). We found that ATP-competitive RAF inhibitors inhibit ERK signalling in cells with mutant BRAF, but unexpectedly enhance signalling in cells with wild-type BRAF. Here we demonstrate the mechanistic basis for these findings. We used chemical genetic methods to show that drug-mediated transactivation of RAF dimers is responsible for paradoxical activation of the enzyme by inhibitors. Induction of ERK signalling requires direct binding of the drug to the ATP-binding site of one kinase of the dimer and is dependent on RAS activity. Drug binding to one member of RAF homodimers (CRAF-CRAF) or heterodimers (CRAF-BRAF) inhibits one protomer, but results in transactivation of the drug-free protomer. In BRAF(V600E) tumours, RAS is not activated, thus transactivation is minimal and ERK signalling is inhibited in cells exposed to RAF inhibitors. These results indicate that RAF inhibitors will be effective in tumours in which BRAF is mutated. Furthermore, because RAF inhibitors do not inhibit ERK signalling in other cells, the model predicts that they would have a higher therapeutic index and greater antitumour activity than mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitors, but could also cause toxicity due to MEK/ERK activation. These predictions have been borne out in a recent clinical trial of the RAF inhibitor PLX4032 (refs 4, 5). The model indicates that promotion of RAF dimerization by elevation of wild-type RAF expression or RAS activity could lead to drug resistance in mutant BRAF tumours. In agreement with this prediction, RAF inhibitors do not inhibit ERK signalling in cells that coexpress BRAF(V600E) and mutant RAS."], ["Host-guest encapsulation of materials by assembled virus protein cages", "Self-assembled cage structures of nanometre dimensions can be used as constrained environments for the preparation of nanostructured materials(1,2) and the encapsulation of guest molecules(3), with potential applications in drug delivery(4) and catalysis(5). In synthetic systems the number of subunits contributing to cage structures is typically rather small(3,6). But the protein coats of viruses (virions) commonly comprise hundreds of subunits that self-assemble into a cage for transporting viral nucleic acids. Many virions, moreover, can undergo reversible structural changes that open or close gated pores to allow switchable access to their interior(7). Here we show that such a virion - that of the cowpea chlorotic mottle virus - can be used as a host for the synthesis of materials. We report the mineralization of two polyoxometalate species (paratungstate and decavanadate) and the encapsulation of an anionic polymer inside this virion, controlled by pH-dependent gating of the virion's pores. The diversity in size and shape of such virus particles make this a versatile strategy for materials synthesis and molecular entrapment."], ["Caspase-11 cleaves gasdermin D for non-canonical inflammasome signalling", "Intracellular lipopolysaccharide from Gram-negative bacteria including Escherichia colt Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, and Burkholderia thailandensis activates mouse caspase-11, causing pyroptotic cell death, interleukin-1 beta processing, and lethal septic shock. How caspase-11 executes these downstream signalling events is largely unknown. Here we show that gasdermin D is essential for caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis and interleukin-1 beta maturation. A forward genetic screen with ethyl-N-nitrosourea-mutagenized mice links Gsdmd to the intracellular lipopolysaccharide response. Macrophages from Gsdmd(-/-) mice generated by gene targeting also exhibit defective pyroptosis and interleukin-1 beta secretion induced by cytoplasmic lipopolysaccharide or Gram-negative bacteria. In addition, Gsdmd(-1-) mice are protected from a lethal dose of lipopolysaccharide. Mechanistically, caspase-11 cleaves gasdermin D, and the resulting amino-terminal fragment promotes both pyroptosis and NLRP3-dependent activation of caspase-1 in a cell-intrinsic manner. Our data identify gasdermin D as a critical target of caspase-11 and a key mediator of the host response against Grain-negative bacteria."], ["Piezoelectric and pyroelectric effects induced by interface polar symmetry", "Interfaces in heterostructures have been a key point of interest in condensed-matter physics for decades owing to a plethora of distinctive phenomena-such as rectification(1), the photovoltaic effect(2), the quantum Hall effect(3) and high-temperature superconductivity(4)-and their critical roles in present-day technical devices. However, the symmetry modulation at interfaces and the resultant effects have been largely overlooked. Here we show that a built-in electric field that originates from band bending at heterostructure interfaces induces polar symmetry therein that results in emergent functionalities, including piezoelectricity and pyroelectricity, even though the component materials are centrosymmetric. We study classic interfaces-namely, Schottky junctions-formed by noble metal and centrosymmetric semiconductors, including niobium-doped strontium titanium oxide crystals, niobium-doped titanium dioxide crystals, niobium-doped barium strontium titanium oxide ceramics, and silicon. The built-in electric field in the depletion region induces polar structures in the semiconductors and generates substantial piezoelectric and pyroelectric effects. In particular, the pyroelectric coefficient and figure of merit of the interface are over one order of magnitude larger than those of conventional bulk polar materials. Our study enriches the functionalities of heterostructure interfaces, offering a distinctive approach to realizing energy transduction beyond the conventional limitation imposed by intrinsic symmetry."], ["Integrated lithium niobate electro-optic modulators operating at CMOS-compatible voltages", "Electro-optic modulators translate high-speed electronic signals into the optical domain and are critical components in modern telecommunication networks(1,2) and microwave-photonic systems(3,4). They are also expected to be building blocks for emerging applications such as quantum photonics(5,6) and non-reciprocal optics(7,8). All of these applications require chip-scale electro-optic modulators that operate at voltages compatible with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology, have ultrahigh electro-optic bandwidths and feature very low optical losses. Integrated modulator platforms based on materials such as silicon, indium phosphide or polymers have not yet been able to meet these requirements simultaneously because of the intrinsic limitations of the materials used. On the other hand, lithium niobate electro-optic modulators, the workhorse of the optoelectronic industry for decades(9), have been challenging to integrate on-chip because of difficulties in microstructuring lithium niobate. The current generation of lithium niobate modulators are bulky, expensive, limited in bandwidth and require high drive voltages, and thus are unable to reach the full potential of the material. Here we overcome these limitations and demonstrate monolithically integrated lithium niobate electro-optic modulators that feature a CMOS-compatible drive voltage, support data rates up to 210 gigabits per second and show an on-chip optical loss of less than 0.5 decibels. We achieve this by engineering the microwave and photonic circuits to achieve high electro-optical efficiencies, ultra-low optical losses and group-velocity matching simultaneously. Our scalable modulator devices could provide cost-effective, low-power and ultra-high-speed solutions for next-generation optical communication networks and microwave photonic systems. Furthermore, our approach could lead to large-scale ultra-low-loss photonic circuits that are reconfigurable on a picosecond timescale, enabling a wide range of quantum and classical applications(5,10,11) including feed-forward photonic quantum computation."], ["Stretchable pumps for soft machines", "Machines made of soft materials bridge life sciences and engineering(1). Advances in soft materials have led to skin-like sensors and muscle-like actuators for soft robots and wearable devices(1-3). Flexible or stretchable counterparts of most key mechatronic components have been developed(4,5), principally using fluidically driven systems(6-8); other reported mechanisms include electrostatic(9-12), stimuli-responsive gels(13,14) and thermally responsive materials such as liquid metals(15-17) and shape-memory polymers(18). Despite the widespread use of fluidic actuation, there have been few soft counterparts of pumps or compressors, limiting the portability and autonomy of soft machines(4,8). Here we describe a class of soft-matter bidirectional pumps based on charge-injection electrohydrodynamics(19). These solid-state pumps are flexible, stretchable, modular, scalable, quiet and rapid. By integrating the pump into a glove, we demonstrate wearable active thermal management. Embedding the pump in an inflatable structure produces a self-contained fluidic 'muscle'. The stretchable pumps have potential uses in wearable laboratory-on-a-chip and microfluidic sensors, thermally active clothing and autonomous soft robots."], ["A metabolic pathway for bile acid dehydroxylation by the gut microbiome", "The biosynthetic pathway that produces the secondary bile acids DCA and LCA in human gut microbes has been fully characterized, engineered into another bacterial host, and used to confer DCA production in germ-free mice-an important proof-of-principle for the engineering of gut microbial pathways. The gut microbiota synthesize hundreds of molecules, many of which influence host physiology. Among the most abundant metabolites are the secondary bile acids deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA), which accumulate at concentrations of around 500 mu M and are known to block the growth ofClostridium difficile(1), promote hepatocellular carcinoma(2)and modulate host metabolism via the G-protein-coupled receptor TGR5 (ref.(3)). More broadly, DCA, LCA and their derivatives are major components of the recirculating pool of bile acids(4); the size and composition of this pool are a target of therapies for primary biliary cholangitis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Nonetheless, despite the clear impact of DCA and LCA on host physiology, an incomplete knowledge of their biosynthetic genes and a lack of genetic tools to enable modification of their native microbial producers limit our ability to modulate secondary bile acid levels in the host. Here we complete the pathway to DCA and LCA by assigning and characterizing enzymes for each of the steps in its reductive arm, revealing a strategy in which the A-B rings of the steroid core are transiently converted into an electron acceptor for two reductive steps carried out by Fe-S flavoenzymes. Using anaerobic in vitro reconstitution, we establish that a set of six enzymes is necessary and sufficient for the eight-step conversion of cholic acid to DCA. We then engineer the pathway intoClostridium sporogenes, conferring production of DCA and LCA on a nonproducing commensal and demonstrating that a microbiome-derived pathway can be expressed and controlled heterologously.

Additionally, certain iridoids are used as sex pheromones in agriculturally important species of aphids, a fact that has underpinned innovative and integrated pest management strategies(5). To harness the biotechnological potential of this natural product class, the enzymes involved in the biosynthetic pathway must be elucidated. Here we report the discovery of iridoid synthase, a plant-derived enzyme that generates the iridoid ring scaffold, as evidenced by biochemical assays, gene silencing, co-expression analysis and localization studies. In contrast to all known monoterpene cyclases, which use geranyl diphosphate as substrate and invoke a cationic intermediate, iridoid synthase uses the linear monoterpene 10-oxogeranial as substrate and probably couples an initial NAD(P) H-dependent reduction step with a subsequent cyclization step via a Diels-Alder cycloaddition or a Michael addition. Our results illustrate how a short-chain reductase was recruited as cyclase for the production of iridoids in medicinal plants. Furthermore, we highlight the prospects of using unrelated reductases to generate artificial cyclic scaffolds. Beyond the recognition of an alternative biochemical mechanism for the biosynthesis of cyclic terpenes, we anticipate that our work will enable the large-scale heterologous production of iridoids in plants and microorganisms for agricultural(5-8) and pharmaceutical(1-4,9) applications."], ["High thermopower of ferri/ferrocyanide redox couple in organic-water solutions", "Thermogalvanic cell (thermocell) represents a promising technology for converting low grade waste heat to electricity. For the cell to be attractive, however, the voltage generated for a given temperature difference has to be high. We report that the electrochemical thermopower can be more than doubled to 2.9 mV K\u22121 when an organic solvent with an appropriate solubility parameter is added to the aqueous electrolyte of ferri/ferrocyanide. This value is better than any reported for the redox couples in aqueous electrolyte as well as in organic solvents. The addition causes a significant rearrangement of the solvation shell, which leads to an increase in the entropy change of the overall redox system and thus an increase in the electrochemical thermopower. For an evaluation of thermoelectric conversion performance, a thermocell with a circulating electrolyte is fabricated as a candidate technology for harvesting thermal energy from liquid cooling systems. The maximum power density obtained, normalized to the square of the inter-electrode temperature difference (~4.1 \u00b0C), is 0.64 mW m\u22122K\u22122, which is approximately 1.8 times higher compared with the thermocell based on pure aqueous electrolyte."], ["Rapidly recovering hydrogel scaffolds from self-assembling diblock copolypeptide amphiphiles", "Protein-based hydrogels are used for many applications, ranging from food and cosmetic thickeners to support matrices for drug delivery and tissue replacement(1-3). These materials are usually prepared using proteins extracted from natural sources, which can give rise to inconsistent properties unsuitable for medical applications(4). Recent developments have utilized recombinant DNA methods to prepare artificial protein hydrogels with specific association mechanisms and responsiveness to various stimuli(5,6). Here we synthesize diblock copolypeptide amphiphiles containing charged and hydrophobic segments. Dilute solutions of these copolypeptides would be expected to form micelles; instead, they form hydrogels that retain their mechanical strength up to temperatures of about 90 degreesC and recover rapidly after stress. The use of synthetic materials permits adjustment of copolymer chain length and composition, which we varied to study their effect on hydrogel formation and properties. We find that gelation depends not only on the amphiphilic nature of the polypeptides, but also on chain conformations-alpha-helix, beta-strand or random coil. Indeed, shape-specific supramolecular assembly is integral to the gelation process, and provides a new class of peptide-based hydrogels with potential for applications in biotechnology."], ["Non-fermentative pathways for synthesis of branched-chain higher alcohols as biofuels", "Global energy and environmental problems have stimulated increased efforts towards synthesizing biofuels from renewable resources(1-3). Compared to the traditional biofuel, ethanol, higher alcohols offer advantages as gasoline substitutes because of their higher energy density and lower hygroscopicity. In addition, branched- chain alcohols have higher octane numbers compared with their straight- chain counterparts. However, these alcohols cannot be synthesized economically using native organisms. Here we present a metabolic engineering approach using Escherichia coli to produce higher alcohols including isobutanol, 1-butanol, 2- methyl- 1- butanol, 3- methyl- 1- butanol and 2- phenylethanol from glucose, a renewable carbon source. This strategy uses the host's highly active amino acid biosynthetic pathway and diverts its 2- keto acid intermediates for alcohol synthesis. In particular, we have achieved high- yield, high- specificity production of isobutanol from glucose. The strategy enables the exploration of biofuels beyond those naturally accumulated to high quantities in microbial fermentation."], ["Directional water collection on wetted spider silk", "Many biological surfaces in both the plant and animal kingdom possess unusual structural features at the micro-and nanometre-scale that control their interaction with water and hence wettability(1-5). An intriguing example is provided by desert beetles, which use micrometre-sized patterns of hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions on their backs to capture water from humid air(6). As anyone who has admired spider webs adorned with dew drops will appreciate, spider silk is also capable of efficiently collecting water from air. Here we show that the water-collecting ability of the capture silk of the cribellate spider Uloborus walckenaerius is the result of a unique fibre structure that forms after wetting, with the 'wet-rebuilt' fibres characterized by periodic spindle-knots made of random nanofibrils and separated by joints made of aligned nanofibrils. These structural features result in a surface energy gradient between the spindle-knots and the joints and also in a difference in Laplace pressure, with both factors acting together to achieve continuous condensation and directional collection of water drops around spindle-knots. Submillimetre-sized liquid drops have been driven by surface energy gradients(7-9) or a difference in Laplace pressure(10), but until now neither force on its own has been used to overcome the larger hysteresis effects that make the movement of micrometre-sized drops more difficult. By tapping into both driving forces, spider silk achieves this task. Inspired by this finding, we designed artificial fibres that mimic the structural features of silk and exhibit its directional water-collecting ability."], ["Strange-metal behaviour in a pure ferromagnetic Kondo lattice", "A wide range of metals exhibit anomalous electrical and thermodynamic properties when tuned to a quantum critical point (QCP), although the origins of such strange metals have posed a long-standing mystery. The frequent association of strange metals with unconventional superconductivity and antiferromagnetic QCPs(1-4) has led to the belief that they are highly entangled quantum states(5). By contrast, ferromagnets are regarded as an unlikely setting for strange metals, because they are weakly entangled and their QCPs are often interrupted by competing phases or first-order phase transitions(6-8). Here we provide evidence that the pure ferromagnetic Kondo lattice(9,10) CeRh6Ge4 becomes a strange metal at a pressure-induced QCP. Measurements of the specific heat and resistivity under pressure demonstrate that the ferromagnetic transition is continuously suppressed to zero temperature, revealing a strange-metal behaviour around the QCP. We argue that strong magnetic anisotropy has a key role in this process, injecting entanglement in the form of triplet resonating valence bonds into the ordered ferromagnet. We show that a singular transformation in the patterns of the entanglement between local moments and conduction electrons, from triplet resonating valence bonds to Kondo-entangled singlet pairs at the QCP, causes a jump in the Fermi surface volume-a key driver of strange-metallic behaviour. Our results open up a direction for research into ferromagnetic quantum criticality and establish an alternative setting for the strange-metal phenomenon. Most importantly, strange-metal behaviour at a ferromagnetic QCP suggests that quantum entanglement-not the destruction of antiferromagnetism-is the common driver of the varied behaviours of strange metals."], ["Creating an Eco-Friendly Building Coating with Smart Subambient Radiative Cooling", "Subambient daytime radiative cooling (SDRC) provides a promising electricity- and cryogen-free pathway for global energy-efficiency. However, current SDRC systems require stringent surface designs, which are neither cost-effective nor eco-friendly, to selectively emit thermal radiation to outer space and simultaneously maximize solar reflectance. Here, a generic method is developed to upgrade the conventional building-coating materials with a peculiar self-adaptive SDRC effect through combining particle scattering, sunlight-excited fluorescence, and mid-infrared broadband radiation. It is also theoretically proved that heat exchange with the sky can eliminate the use of resonant microstructures and noble metal mirrors in conventional SDRC, and also leads to enhanced daytime cooling yet suppressed nighttime overcooling. When exposed to direct sunlight, the upgraded coating over an aluminum plate can achieve 6 \u00b0C (7 \u00b0C on a scale-model building) below the ambient temperature under a solar intensity of 744 W m-2 (850 W m-2 ), yielding a cooling power of 84.2 W m-2 . The results pave the way for practical large-scale applications of high-performance SDRC for human thermal comfort in buildings."], ["Civil conflicts are associated with the global climate", "It has been proposed that changes in global climate have been responsible for episodes of widespread violence and even the collapse of civilizations(1,2). Yet previous studies have not shown that violence can be attributed to the global climate, only that random weather events might be correlated with conflict in some cases(3-7). Here we directly associate planetary-scale climate changes with global patterns of civil conflict by examining the dominant interannual mode of the modern climate(8-10), the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Historians have argued that ENSO may have driven global patterns of civil conflict in the distant past(11-13), a hypothesis that we extend to the modern era and test quantitatively. Using data from 1950 to 2004, we show that the probability of new civil conflicts arising throughout the tropics doubles during El Nino years relative to La Nina years. This result, which indicates that ENSO may have had a role in 21% of all civil conflicts since 1950, is the first demonstration that the stability of modern societies relates strongly to the global climate."], ["Ni-catalyzed ligand-controlled divergent and selective synthesis", "Scaffold diversity is a key feature of a compound library and plays a pivotal role in its success in biological screening. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop efficient strategies to rapidly construct structurally distinct and diverse \u201cprivileged\u201d molecular scaffolds, thereby giving rise to compound libraries with selective and differing biological activities. This review covers recent efforts in this emerging field of Ni-catalyzed divergent and selective synthesis, and will focus on reactions using the same substrate to generate structurally diverse molecular scaffolds by varying the ligand backbone under otherwise almost identical reaction conditions. We hope that the field will be encouraged by the progress achieved, drawing attention to the design and development of new selective catalytic systems, and revealing new modes of catalytic transformation for broader synthetic applications."], ["Decision trees within a molecular memristor", "Profuse dendritic-synaptic interconnections among neurons in the neocortex embed intricate logic structures enabling sophisticated decision-making that vastly outperforms any artificial electronic analogues(1-3). The physical complexity is far beyond existing circuit fabrication technologies: moreover, the network in a brain is dynamically reconfigurable, which provides flexibility and adaptability to changing environments(4-6). In contrast, state-of-the-art semiconductor logic circuits are based on threshold switches that are hard-wired to perform predefined logic functions. To advance the performance of logic circuits, we are re-imagining fundamental electronic circuit elements by expressing complex logic in nanometre-scale material properties. Here we use voltage-driven conditional logic interconnectivity among five distinct molecular redox states of a metal-organic complex to embed a 'thicket' of decision trees (composed of multiple if-then-else conditional statements) having 71 nodes within a single memristor. The resultant current-voltage characteristic of this molecular memristor (a 'memory resistor', a globally passive resistive-switch circuit element that axiomatically complements the set of capacitor, inductor and resistor) exhibits eight recurrent and history-dependent non-volatile switching transitions between two conductance levels in a single sweep cycle. The identity of each molecular redox state was determined with in situ Raman spectroscopy and confirmed by quantum chemical calculations, revealing the electron transport mechanism. Using simple circuits of only these elements, we experimentally demonstrate dynamically reconfigurable, commutative and non-commutative stateful logic in multivariable decision trees that execute in a single time step and can, for example, be applied as local intelligence in edge computing(7-9). Multiple redox transitions in a molecular memristor can be harnessed as 'decision trees' to undertake complex and reconfigurable logic operations in a single time step."], ["Melanomas resist T-cell therapy through inflammation-induced reversible dedifferentiation", "Adoptive cell transfer therapies (ACTs) with cytotoxic T cells that target melanocytic antigens can achieve remissions in patients with metastatic melanomas, but tumours frequently relapse(1,2). Hypotheses explaining the acquired resistance to ACTs include the selection of antigen-deficient tumour cell variants(3-5) and the induction of T-cell tolerance(6). However, the lack of appropriate experimental melanoma models has so far impeded clear insights into the underlying mechanisms. Here we establish an effective ACT protocol in a genetically engineered mouse melanoma model that recapitulates tumour regression, remission and relapse as seen in patients. We report the unexpected observation that melanomas acquire ACT resistance through an inflammation-induced reversible loss of melanocytic antigens. In serial transplantation experiments, melanoma cells switch between a differentiated and a dedifferentiated phenotype in response to T-cell-driven inflammatory stimuli. We identified the proinflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha as a crucial factor that directly caused reversible dedifferentiation of mouse and human melanoma cells. Tumour cells exposed to TNF-alpha were poorly recognized by T cells specific for melanocytic antigens, whereas recognition by T cells specific for non-melanocytic antigens was unaffected or even increased. Our results demonstrate that the phenotypic plasticity of melanoma cells in an inflammatory microenvironment contributes to tumour relapse after initially successful T-cell immunotherapy. On the basis of our work, we propose that future ACT protocols should simultaneously target melanocytic and non-melanocytic antigens to ensure broad recognition of both differentiated and dedifferentiated melanoma cells, and include strategies to sustain T-cell effector functions by blocking immune-inhibitory mechanisms in the tumour microenvironment."], ["Crystal structure of a SNARE complex involved in synaptic exocytosis at 2.4 \u00c5 resolution", "The evolutionarily conserved SNARE proteins and their complexes are involved in the fusion of vesicles with their target membranes; however, the overall organization and structural details of these complexes are unknown. Here we report the X-ray crystal structure at 2.4 Angstrom resolution of a core synaptic fusion complex containing syntaxin-1A, synaptobrevin-II and SNAP-25B. The structure reveals a highly twisted and parallel four-helix bundle that differs from the bundles described for the haemagglutinin and HIV/SIV gp41 membrane-fusion proteins. Conserved leucine-zipper-like layers are found at the centre of the synaptic fusion complex. Embedded within these leucine-ripper layers is an ionic layer consisting of an arginine and three glutamine residues contributed from each of the four alpha-helices. These residues are highly conserved across the entire SNARE family. The regions flanking the leucine-zipper-like layers contain a hydrophobic core similar to that of more general four-helix-bundle proteins. The surface of the synaptic fusion complex is highly grooved and possesses distinct hydrophilic, hydrophobic and charged regions. These characteristics may be important for membrane fusion and for the binding of regulatory factors affecting neurotransmission."], ["A MAMMALIAN PROTEIN TARGETED BY G1-ARRESTING RAPAMYCIN-RECEPTOR COMPLEX", "THE structurally related natural products rapamycin and FK506 bind to the same intracellular receptor, FKBP12, yet the resulting complexes interfere with distinct signalling pathways(1,2). FKBP12- rapamycin inhibits progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle in osteosarcoma(3), liver(4,5) and T cells(6,7) as well as in yeasts, and interferes with mitogenic signalling pathways that are involved in G1 progressiong(9,10), namely with activation of the protein p70(S6k) (refs 5, 11-13) and cyclin-dependent kinases(3,14-16). Here we isolate a mammalian FKBP-rapamycin-associated protein (FRAP) whose binding to structural variants of rapamycin complexed to FKBP12 correlates with the ability of these ligands to inhibit cell-cycle progression. Peptide sequences from purified bovine FRAP were used to isolate a human cDNA clone that is highly related to the DRR1/TOR1 and DRR2/TOR2 gene products from Saccharomyces cerevisiae(8,17,18). Although it has not been previously demonstrated that either of the DRR/TOR gene products can bind the FKBP-rapamycin complex directly(17,19), these yeast genes have been genetically linked to a rapamycin-sensitive pathway and are thought to encode lipid kinases(17-20)."], ["Trapped fractional charges at bulk defects in topological insulators", "Topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) can exhibit unusual, quantized electric phenomena such as fractional electric polarization and boundary-localized fractional charge(1-6). This quantized fractional charge is the generic observable for identification of TCIs that lack clear spectral features(5-7), including ones with higher-order topology(8-11). It has been predicted that fractional charges can also manifest where crystallographic defects disrupt the lattice structure of TCIs, potentially providing a bulk probe of crystalline topology(10,12-14). However, this capability has not yet been confirmed in experiments, given that measurements of charge distributions in TCIs have not been accessible until recently(11). Here we experimentally demonstrate that disclination defects can robustly trap fractional charges in TCI metamaterials, and show that this trapped charge can indicate non-trivial, higher-order crystalline topology even in the absence of any spectral signatures. Furthermore, we uncover a connection between the trapped charge and the existence of topological bound states localized at these defects. We test the robustness of these topological features when the protective crystalline symmetry is broken, and find that a single robust bound state can be localized at each disclination alongside the fractional charge. Our results conclusively show that disclination defects in TCIs can strongly trap fractional charges as well as topological bound states, and demonstrate the primacy of fractional charge as a probe of crystalline topology."], ["Artificial chemical and magnetic structure at the domain walls of an epitaxial oxide", "Progress in nanotechnology requires new approaches to materials synthesis that make it possible to control material functionality down to the smallest scales. An objective of materials research is to achieve enhanced control over the physical properties of materials such as ferromagnets(1), ferroelectrics(2) and superconductors(3). In this context, complex oxides and inorganic perovskites are attractive because slight adjustments of their atomic structures can produce large physical responses and result in multiple functionalities(4,5). In addition, these materials often contain ferroelastic domains(6). The intrinsic symmetry breaking that takes place at the domain walls can induce properties absent from the domains themselves(7), such as magnetic or ferroelectric order and other functionalities, as well as coupling between them. Moreover, large domain wall densities create intense strain gradients, which can also affect the material's properties(8,9). Here we show that, owing to large local stresses, domain walls can promote the formation of unusual phases. In this sense, the domain walls can function as nanoscale chemical reactors. We synthesize a two-dimensional ferromagnetic phase at the domain walls of the orthorhombic perovskite terbium manganite (TbMnO3), which was grown in thin layer sunder epitaxial strain on strontium titanate (SrTiO3) substrates. This phase is yet to be created by standard chemical routes. The density of the two-dimensional sheets can be tuned by changing the film thickness or the substrate lattice parameter (that is, the epitaxial strain), and the distance between sheets can be made as small as 5 nanometres in ultrathin films(10,) such that the new phase at domain walls represents up to 25 per cent of the film volume. The general concept of using domain walls of epitaxial oxides to promote the formation of unusual phases may be applicable to other materials systems, thus giving access to new classes of nanoscale materials for applications in nanoelectronics and spintronics."], ["Photochemical Nickel-Catalyzed C\u2013H Arylation: Synthetic Scope and Mechanistic Investigations", "An iridium photocatalyst and visible light facilitate a room temperature, nickel-catalyzed coupling of (hetero)aryl bromides with activated \u03b1-heterosubstituted or benzylic C(sp3)\u2013H bonds. Mechanistic investigations on this unprecedented transformation have uncovered the possibility of an unexpected mechanism hypothesized to involve a Ni\u2013Br homolysis event from an excited-state nickel complex. The resultant bromine radical is thought to abstract weak C(sp3)\u2013H bonds to generate reactive alkyl radicals that can be engaged in Ni-catalyzed arylation. Evidence suggests that the iridium photocatalyst facilitates nickel excitation and bromine radical generation via triplet\u2013triplet energy transfer."], ["Light-induced conversion of an insulating refractory oxide into a persistent electronic conductor", "Materials that are good electrical conductors are not in general optically transparent, yet a combination of high conductivity and transparency is desirable for many emerging opto-electronic applications(1-6). To this end, various transparent oxides composed of transition or post-transition metals (such as indium tin oxide) are rendered electrically conducting by ion doping(1-6). But such an approach does not work for the abundant transparent oxides of the main-group metals. Here we demonstrate process by which the transparent insulating oxide 12CaO.7Al(2)O(3) (refs 7-13) can be converted into an electrical conductor. H- ions are incorporated into the subnanometre-sized cages of the oxide by a thermal treatment in a hydrogen atmosphere; subsequent irradiation of the material with ultraviolet light results in a conductive state that persists after irradiation ceases. The photo-activated material exhibits moderate electrical conductivity (similar to0.3 S cm(-1)) at room temperature, with visible light absorption losses of only one per cent for 200-nm-thick films. We suggest that this concept can be applied to other main-group metal oxides, for the direct optical writing of conducting wires in insulating transparent media and the formation of a high-density optical memory."], ["Astrophysical detection of the helium hydride ion HeH<SUP>+</SUP>", "During the dawn of chemistry(1,2), when the temperature of the young Universe had fallen below some 4,000 kelvin, the ions of the light elements produced in Big Bang nucleosynthesis recombined in reverse order of their ionization potential. With their higher ionization potentials, the helium ions He2+ and He+ were the first to combine with free electrons, forming the first neutral atoms; the recombination of hydrogen followed. In this metal-free and low-density environment, neutral helium atoms formed the Universe's first molecular bond in the helium hydride ion HeH+ through radiative association with protons. As recombination progressed, the destruction of HeH+ created a path to the formation of molecular hydrogen. Despite its unquestioned importance in the evolution of the early Universe, the HeH+ ion has so far eluded unequivocal detection in interstellar space. In the laboratory the ion was discovered3 as long ago as 1925, but only in the late 1970s was the possibility that HeH+ might exist in local astrophysical plasmas discussed4-7. In particular, the conditions in planetary nebulae were shown to be suitable for producing potentially detectable column densities of HeH+. Here we report observations, based on advances in terahertz spectroscopy8,9 and a high-altitude observatory10, of the rotational ground-state transition of HeH+ at a wavelength of 149.1 micrometres in the planetary nebula NGC 7027. This confirmation of the existence of HeH+ in nearby interstellar space constrains our understanding of the chemical networks that control the formation of this molecular ion, in particular the rates of radiative association and dissociative recombination."], ["Luttinger-liquid behaviour in carbon nanotubes", "Electron transport in conductors is usually well described by Fermi-liquid theory, which assumes that the energy states of the electrons near the Fermi level E(F) are not qualitatively altered by Coulomb interactions. In one-dimensional systems, however, even weak Coulomb interactions cause strong perturbations, The resulting system, known as a Luttinger liquid, is predicted to be distinctly different from its two- and three-dimensional counterparts(1). For example, tunnelling into a Luttinger liquid at energies near the Fermi level is predicted to be strongly suppressed, unlike in two- and three-dimensional metals. Experiments on one-dimensional semiconductor wires(2,3) have been interpreted by using Luttinger-liquid theory, but an unequivocal verification of the theoretical predictions has not yet been obtained, Similarly, the edge excitations seen in fractional quantum Hall conductors are consistent with Luttinger-liquid behaviour(4,5), but recent experiments failed to confirm the predicted relationship between the electrical properties of the bulk state and those of the edge states(6). Electrically conducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) represent quantum wires(7-10) that may exhibit Luttinger-liquid behaviour(11,12). Here we present measurements of the conductance of bundles ('ropes') of SWNTs as a function of temperature and voltage that agree with predictions for tunnelling into a Luttinger liquid. In particular, we find that the conductance and differential conductance scale as power laws with respect to temperature and bias voltage, respectively, and that the functional forms and the exponents are in good agreement with theoretical predictions."], ["Virus-induced senescence is a driver and therapeutic target in COVID-19", "Derailed cytokine and immune cell networks account for the organ damage and the clinical severity of COVID-19 (refs. (1-4)). Here we show that SARS-CoV-2, like other viruses, evokes cellular senescence as a primary stress response in infected cells. Virus-induced senescence (VIS) is indistinguishable from other forms of cellular senescence and is accompanied by a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which comprises pro-inflammatory cytokines, extracellular-matrix-active factors and pro-coagulatory mediators(5-7). Patients with COVID-19 displayed markers of senescence in their airway mucosa in situ and increased serum levels of SASP factors. In vitro assays demonstrated macrophage activation with SASP-reminiscent secretion, complement lysis and SASP-amplifying secondary senescence of endothelial cells, which mirrored hallmark features of COVID-19 such as macrophage and neutrophil infiltration, endothelial damage and widespread thrombosis in affected lung tissue(1,8,9). Moreover, supernatant from VIS cells, including SARS-CoV-2-induced senescence, induced neutrophil extracellular trap formation and activation of platelets and the clotting cascade. Senolytics such as navitoclax and a combination of dasatinib plus quercetin selectively eliminated VIS cells, mitigated COVID-19-reminiscent lung disease and reduced inflammation in SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters and mice. Our findings mark VIS as a pathogenic trigger of COVID-19-related cytokine escalation and organ damage, and suggest that senolytic targeting of virus-infected cells is a treatment option against SARS-CoV-2 and perhaps other viral infections. Virus-induced senescence is a central pathogenic feature in COVID-19, and senolytics, which promote apoptosis of senescent cells, can reduce disease severity in hamsters,mice, as well as humans infected with SARS-CoV-2."], ["Parallel palaeogenomic transects reveal complex genetic history of early European farmers", "Ancient DNA studies have established that Neolithic European populations were descended from Anatolian migrants(1-8) who received a limited amount of admixture from resident huntergatherers(3-5,9). Many open questions remain, however, about the spatial and temporal dynamics of population interactions and admixture during the Neolithic period. Here we investigate the population dynamics of Neolithization across Europe using a high-resolution genome-wide ancient DNA dataset with a total of 180 samples, of which 130 are newly reported here, from the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods of Hungary (6000-2900 BC, n = 100), Germany (5500-3000 BC, n = 42) and Spain (5500-2200 BC, n = 38). We find that genetic diversity was shaped predominantly by local processes, with varied sources and proportions of hunter-gatherer ancestry among the three regions and through time. Admixture between groups with different ancestry profiles was pervasive and resulted in observable population transformation across almost all cultural transitions. Our results shed new light on the ways in which gene flow reshaped European populations throughout the Neolithic period and demonstrate the potential of time-series-based sampling and modelling approaches to elucidate multiple dimensions of historical population interactions."], ["The Atlantic salmon genome provides insights into rediploidization", "The whole-genome duplication 80 million years ago of the common ancestor of salmonids (salmonid-specific fourth vertebrate whole-genome duplication, Ss4R) provides unique opportunities to learn about the evolutionary fate of a duplicated vertebrate genome in 70 extant lineages. Here we present a high-quality genome assembly for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), and show that large genomic reorganizations, coinciding with bursts of transposon-mediated repeat expansions, were crucial for the post-Ss4R rediploidization process. Comparisons of duplicate gene expression patterns across a wide range of tissues with orthologous genes from a pre-Ss4R outgroup unexpectedly demonstrate far more instances of neofunctionalization than subfunctionalization. Surprisingly, we find that genes that were retained as duplicates after the teleost-specific whole-genome duplication 320 million years ago were not more likely to be retained after the Ss4R, and that the duplicate retention was not influenced to a great extent by the nature of the predicted protein interactions of the gene products. Finally, we demonstrate that the Atlantic salmon assembly can serve as a reference sequence for the study of other salmonids for a range of purposes."], ["A chemical switch for inhibitor-sensitive alleles of any protein kinase", "Protein kinases have proved to be largely resistant to the design of highly specific inhibitors, even with the aid of combinatorial chemistry(1). The lack of these reagents has complicated efforts to assign specific signalling roles to individual kinases. Here we describe a chemical genetic strategy for sensitizing protein kinases to cell-permeable molecules that do not inhibit wildtype kinases(2). From two inhibitor scaffolds, we have identified potent and selective inhibitors for sensitized kinases from five distinct subfamilies. Tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases are equally amenable to this approach. We have analysed a budding yeast strain carrying an inhibitor-sensitive form of the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28 (CDK1) in place of the wild-type protein. Specific inhibition of Cdc28 in vivo caused a pre-mitotic cell-cycle arrest that is distinct from the G1 arrest typically observed in temperature-sensitive cdc28 mutants(3). The mutation that confers inhibitor-sensitivity is easily identifiable from primary sequence alignments. Thus, this approach can be used to systematically generate conditional alleles of protein kinases, allowing for rapid functional characterization of members of this important gene family."], ["Organotrifluoroborates:\u2009 Protected Boronic Acids That Expand the Versatility of the Suzuki Coupling Reaction", "Organotrifluoroborates represent an alternative to boronic acids, boronate esters, and organoboranes for use in Suzuki\u2212Miyaura and other transition-metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions.

For example, locus coeruleus noradrenaline (also known as norepinephrine) (LC-NE) neurons receive input from and send output to broad regions of the brain and spinal cord, and regulate diverse functions including arousal, attention, mood and sensory gating(1-8). However, it is unclear how LC-NE neurons divide up their brain-wide projection patterns and whether different LC-NE neurons receive differential input. Here we developed a set of viral-genetic tools to quantitatively analyse the input-output relationship of neural circuits, and applied these tools to dissect the LC-NE circuit in mice. Rabies-virus-based input mapping indicated that LC-NE neurons receive convergent synaptic input from many regions previously identified as sending axons to the locus coeruleus, as well as from newly identified presynaptic partners, including cerebellar Purkinje cells. The 'tracing the relationship between input and output' method (or TRIO method) enables trans-synaptic input tracing from specific subsets of neurons based on their projection and cell type. We found that LC-NE neurons projecting to diverse output regions receive mostly similar input. Projection-based viral labelling revealed that LC-NE neurons projecting to one output region also project to all brain regions we examined. Thus, the LC-NE circuit overall integrates information from, and broadcasts to, many brain regions, consistent with its primary role in regulating brain states. At the same time, we uncovered several levels of specificity in certain LC-NE sub-circuits. These tools for mapping output architecture and input-output relationship are applicable to other neuronal circuits and organisms. More broadly, our viral-genetic approaches provide an efficient intersectional means to target neuronal populations based on cell type and projection pattern."], ["Vif hijacks CBF-\u03b2 to degrade APOBEC3G and promote HIV-1 infection", "Restriction factors, such as the retroviral complementary DNA deaminase APOBEC3G, are cellular proteins that dominantly block virus replication(1-3). The AIDS virus, human immuno deficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), produces the accessory factor Vif, which counteracts the host's antiviral defence by hijacking a ubiquitin ligase complex, containing CUL5, ELOC, ELOB and a RING-box protein, and targeting APOBEC3G for degradation(4-10). Here we reveal, using an affinity tag/purification mass spectrometry approach, that Vif additionally recruits the transcription cofactor CBF-beta to this ubiquitin ligase complex. CBF-beta, which normally functions in concert with RUNX DNA binding proteins, allows the reconstitution of a recombinant six-protein assembly that elicits specific polyubiquitination activity with APOBEC3G, but not the related deaminase APOBEC3A. Using RNA knockdown and genetic complementation studies, we also demonstrate that CBF-beta is required for Vif-mediated degradation of APOBEC3G and therefore for preserving HIV-1 infectivity. Finally, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Vif also binds to and requires CBF-beta to degrade rhesus macaque APOBEC3G, indicating functional conservation. Methods of disrupting the CBF-beta-Vif interaction might enable HIV-1 restriction and provide a supplement to current antiviral therapies that primarily target viral proteins."], ["HSP40 proteins use class-specific regulation to drive HSP70 functional diversity", "The binding and activation of HSP70 by class B J-domain proteins is subject to an autoinhibitory regulatory mechanism that controls substrate targeting to HSP70 and is required for the disaggregation of amyloid fibres. The ubiquitous heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) family consists of ATP-dependent molecular chaperones, which perform numerous cellular functions that affect almost all aspects of the protein life cycle from synthesis to degradation(1-3). Achieving this broad spectrum of functions requires precise regulation of HSP70 activity. Proteins of the HSP40 family, also known as J-domain proteins (JDPs), have a key role in this process by preselecting substrates for transfer to their HSP70 partners and by stimulating the ATP hydrolysis of HSP70, leading to stable substrate binding(3,4). In humans, JDPs constitute a large and diverse family with more than 40 different members(2), which vary in their substrate selectivity and in the nature and number of their client-binding domains(5). Here we show that JDPs can also differ fundamentally in their interactions with HSP70 chaperones. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy(6,7) we find that the major class B JDPs are regulated by an autoinhibitory mechanism that is not present in other classes. Although in all JDPs the interaction of the characteristic J-domain is responsible for the activation of HSP70, in DNAJB1 the HSP70-binding sites in this domain are intrinsically blocked by an adjacent glycine-phenylalanine rich region-an inhibition that can be released upon the interaction of a second site on DNAJB1 with the HSP70 C-terminal tail. This regulation, which controls substrate targeting to HSP70, is essential for the disaggregation of amyloid fibres by HSP70-DNAJB1, illustrating why no other class of JDPs can substitute for class B in this function. Moreover, this regulatory layer, which governs the functional specificities of JDP co-chaperones and their interactions with HSP70s, could be key to the wide range of cellular functions of HSP70."], ["A photochemical dehydrogenative strategy for aniline synthesis", "A dual cobalt and photocatalysis system provides a way to assemble anilines from cyclohexanones and amines by progressively dehydrating the intermediate imine. Chemical reactions that reliably join two molecular fragments together (cross-couplings) are essential to the discovery and manufacture of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals(1,2). The introduction of amines onto functionalized aromatics at specific and pre-determined positions (orthoversusmetaversuspara) is currently achievable only in transition-metal-catalysed processes and requires halogen- or boron-containing substrates(3-6). The introduction of these groups around the aromatic unit is dictated by the intrinsic reactivity profile of the method (electrophilic halogenation or C-H borylation) so selective targeting of all positions is often not possible. Here we report a non-canonical cross-coupling approach for the construction of anilines, exploiting saturated cyclohexanones as aryl electrophile surrogates. Condensation between amines and carbonyls, a process that frequently occurs in nature and is often used by (bio-)organic chemists(7), enables a predetermined and site-selective carbon-nitrogen (C-N) bond formation, while a photoredox- and cobalt-based catalytic system progressively desaturates the cyclohexene ring en route to the aniline. Given that functionalized cyclohexanones are readily accessible with complete regiocontrol using the well established carbonyl reactivity, this approach bypasses some of the frequent selectivity issues of aromatic chemistry. We demonstrate the utility of this C-N coupling protocol by preparing commercial medicines and by the late-stage amination-aromatization of natural products, steroids and terpene feedstocks."], ["Common variants conferring risk of schizophrenia", "Schizophrenia is a complex disorder, caused by both genetic and environmental factors and their interactions. Research on pathogenesis has traditionally focused on neurotransmitter systems in the brain, particularly those involving dopamine. Schizophrenia has been considered a separate disease for over a century, but in the absence of clear biological markers, diagnosis has historically been based on signs and symptoms. A fundamental message emerging from genome-wide association studies of copy number variations (CNVs) associated with the disease is that its genetic basis does not necessarily conform to classical nosological disease boundaries. Certain CNVs confer not only high relative risk of schizophrenia but also of other psychiatric disorders(1-3). The structural variations associated with schizophrenia can involve several genes and the phenotypic syndromes, or the 'genomic disorders', have not yet been characterized(4). Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based genome-wide association studies with the potential to implicate individual genes in complex diseases may reveal underlying biological pathways. Here we combined SNP data from several large genome-wide scans and followed up the most significant association signals. We found significant association with several markers spanning the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region on chromosome 6p21.3-22.1, a marker located upstream of the neurogranin gene (NRGN) on 11q24.2 and a marker in intron four of transcription factor 4 (TCF4) on 18q21.2. Our findings implicating the MHC region are consistent with an immune component to schizophrenia risk, whereas the association with NRGN and TCF4 points to perturbation of pathways involved in brain development, memory and cognition."], ["Genome sequence of <i>Yersinia pestis</i>, the causative agent of plague", "The Gram-negative bacterium Yersinia pestis is the causative agent of the systemic invasive infectious disease classically referred to as plague(1), and has been responsible for three human pandemics: the Justinian plague (sixth to eighth centuries), the Black Death (fourteenth to nineteenth centuries) and modern plague (nineteenth century to the present day). The recent identification of strains resistant to multiple drugs(2) and the potential use of Y. pestis as an agent of biological warfare mean that plague still poses a threat to human health. Here we report the complete genome sequence of Y. pestis strain CO92, consisting of a 4.65-megabase (Mb) chromosome and three plasmids of 96.2 kilobases (kb), 70.3 kb and 9.6 kb. The genome is unusually rich in insertion sequences and displays anomalies in GC base-composition bias, indicating frequent intragenomic recombination. Many genes seem to have been acquired from other bacteria and viruses (including adhesins, secretion systems and insecticidal toxins). The genome contains around 150 pseudogenes, many of which are remnants of a redundant enteropathogenic lifestyle. The evidence of ongoing genome fluidity, expansion and decay suggests Y. pestis is a pathogen that has undergone large-scale genetic flux and provides a unique insight into the ways in which new and highly virulent pathogens evolve."], ["Small molecule inhibition of the KRAS-PDE\u03b4 interaction impairs oncogenic KRAS signalling", "The KRAS oncogene product is considered a major target in anticancer drug discovery(1-3). However, direct interference with KRAS signalling has not yet led to clinically useful drugs(3-8). Correct localization and signalling by farnesylated KRAS is regulated by the prenyl-binding protein PDE delta, which sustains the spatial organization of KRAS by facilitating its diffusion in the cytoplasm(9-11). Here we report that interfering with binding of mammalian PDEd to KRAS by means of small molecules provides a novel opportunity to suppress oncogenic RAS signalling by altering its localization to endomembranes. Biochemical screening and subsequent structure-based hit optimization yielded inhibitors of the KRAS-PDE delta interaction that selectively bind to the prenyl-binding pocket of PDE delta with nanomolar affinity, inhibit oncogenic RAS signalling and suppress in vitro and in vivo proliferation of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells that are dependent on oncogenic KRAS. Our findings may inspire novel drug discovery efforts aimed at the development of drugs targeting oncogenic RAS."], ["Sensitization of silicon by singlet exciton fission in tetracene", "Silicon dominates contemporary solar cell technologies(1). But when absorbing photons, silicon (like other semiconductors) wastes energy in excess of its bandgap(2). Reducing these thermalization losses and enabling better sensitivity to light is possible by sensitizing the silicon solar cell using singlet exciton fission, in which two excited states with triplet spin character (triplet excitons) are generated from a photoexcited state of higher energy with singlet spin character (a singlet exciton)(3-5). Singlet exciton fission in the molecular semiconductor tetracene is known to generate triplet excitons that are energetically matched to the silicon bandgap(6-8). When the triplet excitons are transferred to silicon they create additional electron-hole pairs, promising to increase cell efficiencies from the single-junction limit of 29 per cent to as high as 35 per cent(9). Here we reduce the thickness of the protective hafnium oxynitride layer at the surface of a silicon solar cell to just eight angstroms, using electric-field-effect passivation to enable the efficient energy transfer of the triplet excitons formed in the tetracene. The maximum combined yield of the fission in tetracene and the energy transfer to silicon is around 133 per cent, establishing the potential of singlet exciton fission to increase the efficiencies of silicon solar cells and reduce the cost of the energy that they generate."], ["Interactions between macromolecules and ions: the Hofmeister series", "The Hofmeister series, first noted in 1888, ranks the relative influence of ions on the physical behavior of a wide variety of aqueous processes ranging from colloidal assembly to protein folding. Originally, it was thought that an ion\u2019s influence on macromolecular properties was caused at least in part by \u2018making\u2019 or \u2018breaking\u2019 bulk water structure. Recent time\u0002resolved and thermodynamic studies of water molecules in salt solutions, however, demonstrate that bulk water structure is not central to the Hofmeister effect. Instead, models are being developed that depend upon direct ion\u2013macromolecule interactions as well as interactions with water molecules in the first hydration shell of the macromolecule."], ["Chemical compass model of avian magnetoreception", "Approximately 50 species, including birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, crustaceans and insects, are known to use the Earth's magnetic field for orientation and navigation(1). Birds in particular have been intensively studied, but the biophysical mechanisms that underlie the avian magnetic compass are still poorly understood. One proposal, based on magnetically sensitive free radical reactions(2,3), is gaining support(4-11) despite the fact that no chemical reaction in vitro has been shown to respond to magnetic fields as weak as the Earth's (similar to 50 mu T) or to be sensitive to the direction of such a field. Here we use spectroscopic observation of a carotenoid-porphyrin-fullerene model system to demonstrate that the lifetime of a photochemically formed radical pair is changed by application of <= 50 mu T magnetic fields, and to measure the anisotropic chemical response that is essential for its operation as a chemical compass sensor. These experiments establish the feasibility of chemical magnetoreception and give insight into the structural and dynamic design features required for optimal detection of the direction of the Earth's magnetic field."], ["Molecular nucleation mechanisms and control strategies for crystal polymorph selection", "The formation of condensed (compacted) protein phases is associated with a wide range of human disorders, such as eye cataracts(1), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis(2), sickle cell anaemia(3) and Alzheimer's disease(4). However, condensed protein phases have their uses: as crystals, they are harnessed by structural biologists to elucidate protein structures(5), or are used as delivery vehicles for pharmaceutical applications(6). The physiochemical properties of crystals can vary substantially between different forms or structures ('polymorphs') of the same macromolecule, and dictate their usability in a scientific or industrial context. To gain control over an emerging polymorph, one needs a molecular-level understanding of the pathways that lead to the various macroscopic states and of the mechanisms that govern pathway selection. However, it is still not clear how the embryonic seeds of a macromolecular phase are formed, or how these nuclei affect polymorph selection. Here we use time-resolved cryo-transmission electron microscopy to image the nucleation of crystals of the protein glucose isomerase, and to uncover at molecular resolution the nucleation pathways that lead to two crystalline states and one gelled state. We show that polymorph selection takes place at the earliest stages of structure formation and is based on specific building blocks for each space group. Moreover, we demonstrate control over the system by selectively forming desired polymorphs through site-directed mutagenesis, specifically tuning intermolecular bonding or gel seeding. Our results differ from the present picture of protein nucleation(7-12), in that we do not identify a metastable dense liquid as the precursor to the crystalline state. Rather, we observe nucleation events that are driven by oriented attachments between subcritical clusters that already exhibit a degree of crystallinity. These insights suggest ways of controlling macromolecular phase transitions, aiding the development of protein-based drug-delivery systems and macromolecular crystallography."], ["A robust DNA mechanical device controlled by hybridization topology", "Controlled mechanical movement in molecular-scale devices has been realized in a variety of systems-catenanes and rotaxanes(1-3), chiroptical molecular switches(4), molecular ratchets(5) and DNA(6)- by exploiting conformational changes triggered by changes in redox potential or temperature, reversible binding of small molecules or ions, or irradiation. The incorporation of such devices into arrays(7,8) could in principle lead to complex structural states suitable for nanorobotic applications, provided that individual devices can be addressed separately. But because the triggers commonly used tend to act equally on all the devices that are present, they will need to be localized very tightly. This could be readily achieved with devices that are controlled individually by separate and device-specific reagents. A trigger mechanism that allows such specific control is the reversible binding of DNA strands, thereby 'fuelling' conformational changes in a DNA machine(9). Here we improve upon the initial prototype system that uses this mechanism but generates by-products(9), by demonstrating a robust sequence-dependent rotary DNA device operating in a four-step cycle. We show that DNA strands control and fuel our device cycle by inducing the interconversion between two robust topological motifs, paranemic crossover (PX) DNA(10,11) and its topoisomer JX(2) DNA, in which one strand end is rotated relative to the other by 180 degrees. We expect that a wide range of analogous yet distinct rotary devices can be created by changing the control strands and the device sequences to which they bind."], ["Chemical gradients in human enamel crystallites", "Dental enamel is a principal component of teeth(1), and has evolved to bear large chewing forces, resist mechanical fatigue and withstand wear over decades(2). Functional impairment and loss of dental enamel, caused by developmental defects or tooth decay (caries), affect health and quality of life, with associated costs to society(3). Although the past decade has seen progress in our understanding of enamel formation (amelogenesis) and the functional properties of mature enamel, attempts to repair lesions in this material or to synthesize it in vitro have had limited success(4-6). This is partly due to the highly hierarchical structure of enamel and additional complexities arising from chemical gradients(7-9). Here we show, using atomic-scale quantitative imaging and correlative spectroscopies, that the nanoscale crystallites of hydroxylapatite (Ca-5(PO4)(3)(OH)), which are the fundamental building blocks of enamel, comprise two nanometric layers enriched in magnesium flanking a core rich in sodium, fluoride and carbonate ions; this sandwich core is surrounded by a shell with lower concentration of substitutional defects. A mechanical model based on density functional theory calculations and X-ray diffraction data predicts that residual stresses arise because of the chemical gradients, in agreement with preferential dissolution of the crystallite core in acidic media. Furthermore, stresses may affect the mechanical resilience of enamel. The two additional layers of hierarchy suggest a possible new model for biological control over crystal growth during amelogenesis, and hint at implications for the preservation of biomarkers during tooth development. Hydroxylapatite crystallites in human dental enamel show gradients in chemical composition, with a layer of magnesium enrichment on each side of a core rich in sodium, fluoride and carbonate ions."], ["SELECTIVE BINDING AND REMOVAL OF GUESTS IN A MICROPOROUS METAL-ORGANIC FRAMEWORK", "MICROPOROUS inorganic materials such as zeolites find widespread application in heterogeneous catalysis, adsorption and ion-exchange processes. The rigidity and stability of such frameworks allow for shape- and size-selective inclusion of organic molecules and ions(1-4). Analogous microporous structures based on organic building blocks have the potential for more precise rational design, through control of the shape, size and functionalization of the pores(5-8). Here we report the synthesis of a metal-organic framework designed to bind aromatic guest molecules selectively. The basic building block is a symmetric organic molecule, which binds metal ions(9,10) to form layers of the metal-organic compound alternating with layers whose composition is determined by the functionalization of the starting molecules. The layers create channels in which guest aromatic molecules may be selectively bound, We show that the crystal lattice thus formed is thermally stable up to 350 degrees C, even after removal of included guest molecules, and that the inclusions can be selectively readsorbed."], ["Genome-wide enhancer maps link risk variants to disease genes", "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of noncoding loci that are associated with human diseases and complextraits, each of which could reveal insights into the mechanisms of disease(1). Many ofthe underlying causal variants may affect enhancers(2,3), but we lack accurate maps of enhancers and their target genes to interpret such variants. We recently developed the activity-by-contact (ABC) model to predict which enhancers regulate which genes and validated the model using CRISPR perturbations in several cell types(4). Here we apply this ABC model to create enhancer-gene maps in 131 human cell types and tissues, and use these maps to interpret the functions of GWAS variants. Across 72 diseases and complex traits, ABC links 5,036 GWAS signals to 2,249 unique genes, including a class of 577genesthat appear to influence multiple phenotypes through variants in enhancers that act in different cell types. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), causal variants are enriched in predicted enhancers by more than 20-fold in particular cell types such as dendritic cells, and ABC achieves higher precision than other regulatory methods at connecting noncoding variants to target genes. These variant-to-function maps reveal an enhancer that contains an IBD risk variant and that regulates the expression of PPIF to alter the membrane potential of mitochondria in macrophages. Our study reveals principles of genome regulation, identifies genes that affect IBD and provides a resource and generalizable strategy to connect risk variants of common diseases to their molecular and cellular functions."], ["Butterfly genome reveals promiscuous exchange of mimicry adaptations among species", "The evolutionary importance of hybridization and introgression has long been debated(1). Hybrids are usually rare and unfit, but even infrequent hybridization can aid adaptation by transferring beneficial traits between species. Here we use genomic tools to investigate introgression in Heliconius, a rapidly radiating genus of neotropical butterflies widely used in studies of ecology, behaviour, mimicry and speciation(2-5). We sequenced the genome of Heliconius melpomene and compared it with other taxa to investigate chromosomal evolution in Lepidoptera and gene flow among multiple Heliconius species and races. Among 12,669 predicted genes, biologically important expansions of families of chemosensory and Hox genes are particularly noteworthy. Chromosomal organization has remained broadly conserved since the Cretaceous period, when butterflies split from the Bombyx (silkmoth) lineage. Using genomic resequencing, we show hybrid exchange of genes between three co-mimics, Heliconius melpomene, Heliconius timareta and Heliconius elevatus, especially at two genomic regions that control mimicry pattern. We infer that closely related Heliconius species exchange protective colour-pattern genes promiscuously, implying that hybridization has an important role in adaptive radiation."], ["Biological, clinical and population relevance of 95 loci for blood lipids", "Plasma concentrations of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides are among the most important risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) and are targets for therapeutic intervention. We screened the genome for common variants associated with plasma lipids in >100,000 individuals of European ancestry. Here we report 95 significantly associated loci (P<5 x 10(-8)), with 59 showing genome-wide significant association with lipid traits for the first time. The newly reported associations include single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near known lipid regulators (for example, CYP7A1, NPC1L1 and SCARB1) as well as in scores of loci not previously implicated in lipoprotein metabolism. The 95 loci contribute not only to normal variation in lipid traits but also to extreme lipid phenotypes and have an impact on lipid traits in three non-European populations (East Asians, South Asians and African Americans). Our results identify several novel loci associated with plasma lipids that are also associated with CAD. Finally, we validated three of the novel genes-GALNT2, PPP1R3B and TTC39B-with experiments in mouse models. Taken together, our findings provide the foundation to develop a broader biological understanding of lipoprotein metabolism and to identify new therapeutic opportunities for the prevention of CAD."], ["Rationally tuning the reduction potential of a single cupredoxin beyond the natural range", "Redox processes are at the heart of numerous functions in chemistry and biology, from long-range electron transfer in photosynthesis and respiration to catalysis in industrial and fuel cell research. These functions are accomplished in nature by only a limited number of redox-active agents. A long-standing issue in these fields is how redox potentials are fine-tuned over a broad range with little change to the redox-active site or electron-transfer properties. Resolving this issue will not only advance our fundamental understanding of the roles of long-range, non-covalent interactions in redox processes, but also allow for design of redox-active proteins having tailor-made redox potentials for applications such as artificial photosynthetic centres(1,2) or fuel cell catalysts(3) for energy conversion. Here we show that two important secondary coordination sphere interactions, hydrophobicity and hydrogen-bonding, are capable of tuning the reduction potential of the cupredoxin azurin over a 700 mV range, surpassing the highest and lowest reduction potentials reported for any mononuclear cupredoxin, without perturbing the metal binding site beyond what is typical for the cupredoxin family of proteins. We also demonstrate that the effects of individual structural features are additive and that redox potential tuning of azurin is now predictable across the full range of cupredoxin potentials."], ["Computational prediction of small-molecule catalysts", "Most organic and organometallic catalysts have been discovered through serendipity or trial and error, rather than by rational design. Computational methods, however, are rapidly becoming a versatile tool for understanding and predicting the roles of such catalysts in asymmetric reactions. Such methods should now be regarded as a first line of attack in the design of catalysts."], ["Entropic evidence for a Pomeranchuk effect in magic-angle graphene", "In the 1950s, Pomeranchuk(1) predicted that, counterintuitively, liquid He-3 may solidify on heating. This effect arises owing to high excess nuclear spin entropy in the solid phase, where the atoms are spatially localized. Here we find that an analogous effect occurs in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene(2-6). Using both local and global electronic entropy measurements, we show that near a filling of one electron per moire unit cell, there is a marked increase in the electronic entropy to about 1k(B) per unit cell (k(B) is the Boltzmann constant). This large excess entropy is quenched by an in-plane magnetic field, pointing to its magnetic origin. A sharp drop in the compressibility as a function of the electron density, associated with a reset of the Fermi level back to the vicinity of the Dirac point, marks a clear boundary between two phases. We map this jump as a function of electron density, temperature and magnetic field. This reveals a phase diagram that is consistent with a Pomeranchuk-like temperature- and field-driven transition from a low-entropy electronic liquid to a high-entropy correlated state with nearly free magnetic moments. The correlated state features an unusual combination of seemingly contradictory properties, some associated with itinerant electrons-such as the absence of a thermodynamic gap, metallicity and a Dirac-like compressibility-and others associated with localized moments, such as a large entropy and its disappearance under a magnetic field. Moreover, the energy scales characterizing these two sets of properties are very different: whereas the compressibility jump has an onset at a temperature of about 30 kelvin, the bandwidth of magnetic excitations is about 3 kelvin or smaller. The hybrid nature of the present correlated state and the large separation of energy scales have implications for the thermodynamic and transport properties of the correlated states in twisted bilayer graphene."], ["Ubiquitination independent of E1 and E2 enzymes by bacterial effectors", "Signalling by ubiquitination regulates virtually every cellular process in eukaryotes. Covalent attachment of ubiquitin to a substrate is catalysed by the E1, E2 and E3 three-enzyme cascade(1), which links the carboxy terminus of ubiquitin to the e-amino group of, in most cases, a lysine of the substrate via an isopeptide bond. Given the essential roles of ubiquitination in the regulation of the immune system, it is not surprising that the ubiquitination network is a common target for diverse infectious agents(2). For example, many bacterial pathogens exploit ubiquitin signalling using virulence factors that function as E3 ligases, deubiquitinases3 or as enzymes that directly attack ubiquitin(4). The bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila utilizes approximately 300 effectors that modulate diverse host processes to create a permissive niche for its replication in phagocytes(5). Here we demonstrate that members of the SidE effector family of L. pneumophila ubiquitinate multiple Rab small GTPases associated with the endoplasmic reticulum. Moreover, we show that these proteins are capable of catalysing ubiquitination without the need for the E1 and E2 enzymes. A putative mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase motif critical for the ubiquitination activity is also essential for the role of the SidE family in intracellular bacterial replication in a protozoan host. The E1/E2-independent ubiquitination catalysed by these enzymes is energized by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, which activates ubiquitin by the formation of ADP-ribosylated ubiquitin. These results establish that ubiquitination can be catalysed by a single enzyme, the activity of which does not require ATP."], ["Structure of <i>Escherichia coli</i> RNase E catalytic domain and implications for RNA turnover", "The coordinated regulation of gene expression is required for homeostasis, growth and development in all organisms. Such coordination may be partly achieved at the level of messenger RNA stability(1), in which the targeted destruction of subsets of transcripts generates the potential for cross-regulating metabolic pathways. In Escherichia coli, the balance and composition of the transcript population is affected by RNase E, an essential endoribonuclease that not only turns over RNA but also processes certain key RNA precursors(2-10). RNase E cleaves RNA internally, but its catalytic power is determined by the 50 terminus of the substrate, even if this lies at a distance from the cutting site(11-14). Here we report crystal structures of the catalytic domain of RNase E as trapped allosteric intermediates with RNA substrates. Four subunits of RNase E catalytic domain associate into an interwoven quaternary structure, explaining why the subunit organization is required for catalytic activity. The subdomain encompassing the active site is structurally congruent to a deoxyribonuclease, making an unexpected link in the evolutionary history of RNA and DNA nucleases. The structure explains how the recognition of the 50 terminus of the substrate may trigger catalysis and also sheds light on the question of how RNase E might selectively process, rather than destroy, specific RNA precursors."], ["Mechanosensation of cyclical force by PIEZO1 is essential for innate immunity", "Direct recognition of invading pathogens by innate immune cells is a critical driver of the inflammatory response. However, cells of the innate immune system can also sense their local microenvironment and respond to physiological fluctuations in temperature, pH, oxygen and nutrient availability, which are altered during inflammation. Although cells of the immune system experience force and pressure throughout their life cycle, little is known about how these mechanical processes regulate the immune response. Here we show that cyclical hydrostatic pressure, similar to that experienced by immune cells in the lung, initiates an inflammatory response via the mechanically activated ion channel PIEZO1. Mice lacking PIEZO1 in innate immune cells showed ablated pulmonary inflammation in the context of bacterial infection or fibrotic autoinflammation. Our results reveal an environmental sensory axis that stimulates innate immune cells to mount an inflammatory response, and demonstrate a physiological role for PIEZO1 and mechanosensation in immunity."], ["Quantifying the cost savings of global solar photovoltaic supply chains", "Achieving carbon neutrality requires deploying renewable energy at unprecedented speed and scale(1,2), yet countries sometimes implement policies that increase costs by restricting the free flow of capital, talent and innovation in favour of localizing benefits such as economic growth, employment and trade surpluses(3,4). Here we assess the cost savings from a globalized solar photovoltaic (PV) module supply chain. We develop a two-factor learning model using historical capacity, component and input material price data of solar PV deployment in the United States, Germany and China. We estimate that the globalized PV module market has saved PV installers US$24 (19-31) billion in the United States, US$7 (5-9) billion in Germany and US$36 (26-45) billion in China from 2008 to 2020 compared with a counterfactual scenario in which domestic manufacturers supply an increasing proportion of installed capacities over a ten-year period. Projecting the same scenario forwards from 2020 results in estimated solar module prices that are approximately 20-25 per cent higher in 2030 compared with a future with globalized supply chains. International climate policy benefits from a globalized low-carbon value chain4, and these results point to the need for complementary policies to mitigate welfare distribution effects and potential impacts on technological crowding out."], ["Cloning of a disintegrin metalloproteinase that processes precursor tumour-necrosis factor-alpha", "Tumour-necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a cytokine that contributes to a variety of inflammatory disease states(1). The protein exists as a membrane-bound precursor(2,3) of relative molecular mass 26K which can be processed by a TNF-alpha-converting enzyme (TACE), to generate secreted 17K mature TNF-alpha. We have purified TACE and cloned its complementary DNA. TACE is a membrane-bound disintegrin metalloproteinase. Structural comparisons with other disintegrin-containing enzymes indicate that TACE is unique, with noteable sequence identity to MADM(4), an enzyme implicated in myelin degradation, and to KUZ(5), a Drosophila homologue of MADM important for neuronal development. The expression of recombinant TACE (rTACE) results in the production of functional enzyme that correctly processes precursor TNF-alpha to the mature form. The rTACE provides a readily available source of enzyme to help in the search for new anti-inflammatory agents that target the final processing stage of TNF-alpha production."], ["Circularly polarized light generated by photoexcitation of luminophores in glassy liquid-crystal films", "Optical information processing, display and storage can be accomplished with linearly or circularly polarized light, In passive (non-emitting) devices, linear polarization can be produced by anisotropic absorption of light(1), whereas circular polarization has been attained by selective reflection of unpolarized light propagating through a chiral-nematic liquid-crystal film(2). Active (light-emitting) devices capable of polarized emission are also needed. In principle, optical and electronic excitation of materials containing uniaxially and helically arranged luminophores should produce linearly and circularly polarized emission, respectively. In practice, the former is easier to achieve and is therefore more technologically advanced(3-8). Here rye report the generation of strongly circularly polarized photoluminescence from films of glass-forming chiral-nematic liquid crystals(9) in which are embedded light-emitting dopants, This host material apparently induced alignment of the luminophores to a degree that produces almost pure circular polarization within the 400-420-nm wavelength band of the emitted light. We anticipate that composite films of this sort might find applications within photonic technology such as colour-image projection(10) and stereoscopic displays(11)."], ["Limits on gas impermeability of graphene", "Despite being only one-atom thick, defect-free graphene is considered to be completely impermeable to all gases and liquids(1-10). This conclusion is based on theory(3-8) and supported by experiments(1,9,10) that could not detect gas permeation through micrometre-size membranes within a detection limit of 10(5) to 10(6) atoms per second. Here, using small monocrystalline containers tightly sealed with graphene, we show that defect-free graphene is impermeable with an accuracy of eight to nine orders of magnitude higher than in the previous experiments. We are capable of discerning (but did not observe) permeation of just a few helium atoms per hour, and this detection limit is also valid for all other gases tested (neon, nitrogen, oxygen, argon, krypton and xenon), except for hydrogen. Hydrogen shows noticeable permeation, even though its molecule is larger than helium and should experience a higher energy barrier. This puzzling observation is attributed to a two-stage process that involves dissociation of molecular hydrogen at catalytically active graphene ripples, followed by adsorbed atoms flipping to the other side of the graphene sheet with a relatively low activation energy of about 1.0 electronvolt, a value close to that previously reported for proton transport(11,12). Our work provides a key reference for the impermeability of two-dimensional materials and is important from a fundamental perspective and for their potential applications."], ["Two-dimensional normal-state quantum oscillations in a superconducting heterostructure", "Semiconductor heterostructures provide an ideal platform for studying high-mobility, low-density electrons in reduced dimensions(1-4). The realization of superconductivity in heavily doped diamond(5), silicon(6), silicon carbide(7) and germanium(8) suggests that Cooper pairs eventually may be directly incorporated in semiconductor heterostructures(9), but these newly discovered superconductors are currently limited by their extremely large electronic disorder. Similarly, the electron mean free path in low-dimensional superconducting thin films is usually limited by interface scattering, in single-crystal or polycrystalline samples, or atomic-scale disorder, in amorphous materials, confining these examples to the extreme 'dirty limit'(10). Here we report the fabrication of a high-quality superconducting layer within a thin-film heterostructure based on SrTiO3 ( the first known superconducting semiconductor(11)). By selectively doping a narrow region of SrTiO3 with the electron-donor niobium, we form a superconductor that is two-dimensional, as probed by the anisotropy of the upper critical magnetic field. Unlike in previous examples, however, the electron mobility is high enough that the normal state resistance exhibits Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations that scale with the perpendicular field, indicating two-dimensional states. These results suggest that delta-doped SrTiO3 provides a model system in which to explore the quantum transport and interplay(12) of both superconducting and normal electrons. They also demonstrate that high-quality complex oxide heterostructures can maintain electron coherence on the macroscopic scales probed by transport, as well as on the microscopic scales demonstrated previously(13)."], ["An anisotropic hydrogel with electrostatic repulsion between cofacially aligned nanosheets", "Machine technology frequently puts magnetic or electrostatic repulsive forces to practical use, as in maglev trains, vehicle suspensions or non-contact bearings(1,2). In contrast, materials design overwhelmingly focuses on attractive interactions, such as in the many advanced polymer-based composites, where inorganic fillers interact with a polymer matrix to improve mechanical properties. However, articular cartilage strikingly illustrates how electrostatic repulsion can be harnessed to achieve unparalleled functional efficiency: it permits virtually friction-less mechanical motion within joints, even under high compression(3,4). Here we describe a composite hydrogel with anisotropic mechanical properties dominated by electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged unilamellar titanate nanosheets(5) embedded within it. Crucial to the behaviour of this hydrogel is the serendipitous discovery of cofacial nanosheet alignment in aqueous colloidal dispersions subjected to a strong magnetic field, which maximizes electrostatic repulsion(6) and thereby induces a quasi-crystalline structural ordering(7,8) over macroscopic length scales and with uniformly large face-to-face nanosheet separation. We fix this transiently induced structural order by transforming the dispersion into a hydrogel(9,10) using light-triggered in situ vinyl polymerization(11). The resultant hydrogel, containing charged inorganic structures that align cofacially in a magnetic flux(12-19), deforms easily under shear forces applied parallel to the embedded nanosheets yet resists compressive forces applied orthogonally. We anticipate that the concept of embedding anisotropic repulsive electrostatics within a composite material, inspired by articular cartilage, will open up new possibilities for developing soft materials with unusual functions."], ["Electrical spin injection and accumulation at room temperature in an all-metal mesoscopic spin valve", "Finding a means to generate, control and use spin-polarized currents represents an important challenge for spin-based electronics(1-3), or 'spintronics'. Spin currents and the associated phenomenon of spin accumulation can be realized by driving a current from a ferromagnetic electrode into a non-magnetic metal or semiconductor. This was first demonstrated over 15 years ago in a spin injection experiment(4) on a single crystal aluminium bar at temperatures below 77 K. Recent experiments(5-8) have demonstrated successful optical detection of spin injection in semiconductors, using either optical injection by circularly polarized light or electrical injection from a magnetic semiconductor. However, it has not been possible to achieve fully electrical spin injection and detection at room temperature. Here we report room-temperature electrical injection and detection of spin currents and observe spin accumulation in an all-metal lateral mesoscopic spin valve, where ferromagnetic electrodes are used to drive a spin-polarized current into crossed copper strips. We anticipate that larger signals should be obtainable by optimizing the choice of materials and device geometry."], ["Time-resolved protein activation by proximal decaging in living systems", "A universal gain-of-function approach for selective and temporal control of protein activity in living systems is crucial to understanding dynamic cellular processes. Here we report development of a computationally aided and genetically encoded proximal decaging (hereafter, CAGE-prox) strategy that enables time-resolved activation of a broad range of proteins in living cells and mice. Temporal blockage of protein activity was computationally designed and realized by genetic incorporation of a photo-caged amino acid in proximity to the functional site of the protein, which can be rapidly removed upon decaging, resulting in protein re-activation. We demonstrate the wide applicability of our method on diverse protein families, which enabled orthogonal tuning of cell signalling and immune responses, temporal profiling of proteolytic substrates upon caspase activation as well as the development of protein-based pro-drug therapy. We envision that CAGE-prox will open opportunities for the gain-of-function study of proteins and dynamic biological processes with high precision and temporal resolution."], ["Superconductivity at 25.5 K in electron-doped layered hafnium nitride", "The electronic properties of crystals with a layered structure can be radically altered by the intercalation, between the layers, of guest species that act as electron donors or accepters. Such studies have been performed extensively on graphite, transition-metal dichalcogenides and oxide bronzes(1). Interest in redox intercalation reactions(2) has increased recently because the high-transition-temperature (high-T-c) superconductors based on copper oxide also have layered structures, the superconductivity occurring within two-dimensional CuO2 planes separated by charge-reservoir oxide layers(3). Similarly, in metal-doped fullerenes, which show relatively high transition temperatures, the electron donor atoms sit in the interstitial sites between adjacent fullerene balls(4). In a previous study(5), we described a layered nitride, beta-ZrNCl, consisting of Zr-N double layers sandwiched between two close-packed chlorine layers. On lithium intercalation, the crystal changed from a semiconductor to a metal, and became a superconductor at 13 K. Here we report the properties of the isostructural compound beta-HfNCl. After electron-doping the crystal by lithium intercalation, we observe superconductivity with a T-c of up to 25.5 K. This transition temperature is higher than that observed in any intermetallic compound, and suggests that layered nitride structures may offer transition temperatures comparable to those observed in layered copper oxide structures."], ["Key role of chemistry versus bias in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution", "The oxygen evolution reaction has an important role in many alternative-energy schemes because it supplies the protons and electrons required for converting renewable electricity into chemical fuels(1-3). Electrocatalysts accelerate the reaction by facilitating the required electron transfer(4), as well as the formation and rupture of chemical bonds(5). This involvement in fundamentally different processes results in complex electrochemical kinetics that can be challenging to understand and control, and that typically depends exponentially on overpotential(1,2,6,7). Such behaviour emerges when the applied bias drives the reaction in line with the phenomenological Butler-Volmer theory, which focuses on electron transfer(8), enabling the use of Tafel analysis to gain mechanistic insight under quasi-equilibrium(9-11) or steady-state assumptions(12). However, the charging of catalyst surfaces under bias also affects bond formation and rupture(13-15), the effect of which on the electrocatalytic rate is not accounted for by the phenomenological Tafel analysis(8) and is often unknown. Here we report pulse voltammetry and operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements on iridium oxide to show that the applied bias does not act directly on the reaction coordinate, but affects the electrocatalytically generated current through charge accumulation in the catalyst. We find that the activation free energy decreases linearly with the amount of oxidative charge stored, and show that this relationship underlies electrocatalytic performance and can be evaluated using measurement and computation. We anticipate that these findings and our methodology will help to better understand other electrocatalytic materials and design systems with improved performance. Spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations of the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction establish that reaction rates depend on the amount of charge stored in the electrocatalyst, and not on the applied potential."], ["Oxidative DNA damage through long-range electron transfer", "The possibility has been considered for almost forty years that the DNA double helix, which contains a pi-stacked array of heterocyclic base pairs, could be a suitable medium for the migration of charge over long molecular distances(1-11). This notion of high charge mobility is a critical consideration with respect to DNA damage. We have previously found(7-10) that the DNA double helix can serve as a molecular bridge for photo-induced electron transfer between metallointercalators, with fast rates (greater than or equal to 10(10) s(-1))(10) and with quenching over a long distance (>40 Angstrom)(8). Here we use a metallointercalator to introduce a photoexcited hole into the DNA pi-stacked at a specific site in order to evaluate oxidative damage to DNA from a distance. Oligomeric DNA duplexes were prepared with a rhodium intercalator covalently attached to one end and separated spatially from 5'-GG-3' doublet sites of oxidation. Rhodium-induced photo-oxidation occurs specifically at the 5'-G in the 5'-GG-3' doublets and is observed up to 37 Angstrom away from the site of rhodium intercalation. We find that the yield of oxidative damage depends sensitively upon oxidation potential and pi-stacking, but not on distance. These results demonstrate directly that oxidative damage to DNA may be promoted from a remote site as a result of hole migration through the DNA pi-stack."], ["Generation of electron beams carrying orbital angular momentum", "All forms of waves can contain phase singularities(1-4). In the case of optical waves, a light beam with a phase singularity carries orbital angular momentum, and such beams have found a range of applications in optical manipulation, quantum information and astronomy(3-9). Here we report the generation of an electron beam with a phase singularity propagating in free space, which we achieve by passing a plane electron wave through a spiral phase plate constructed naturally from a stack of graphite thin films. The interference pattern between the final beam and a plane electron wave in a transmission electron microscope shows the 'Y'-like defect pattern characteristic of a beam carrying a phase singularity with a topological charge equal to one. This fundamentally new electron degree of freedom could find application in a number of research areas, as is the case for polarized electron beams."], ["Structure of hepcidin-bound ferroportin reveals iron homeostatic mechanisms", "Structures of the iron transporter ferroportin and the peptide hormone hepcidin suggest how iron homeostasis is tightly regulated. The serum level of iron in humans is tightly controlled by the action of the hormone hepcidin on the iron efflux transporter ferroportin. Hepcidin regulates iron absorption and recycling by inducing the internalization and degradation of ferroportin(1). Aberrant ferroportin activity can lead to diseases of iron overload, such as haemochromatosis, or iron limitation anaemias(2). Here we determine cryogenic electron microscopy structures of ferroportin in lipid nanodiscs, both in the apo state and in complex with hepcidin and the iron mimetic cobalt. These structures and accompanying molecular dynamics simulations identify two metal-binding sites within the N and C domains of ferroportin. Hepcidin binds ferroportin in an outward-open conformation and completely occludes the iron efflux pathway to inhibit transport. The carboxy terminus of hepcidin directly contacts the divalent metal in the ferroportin C domain. Hepcidin binding to ferroportin is coupled to iron binding, with an 80-fold increase in hepcidin affinity in the presence of iron. These results suggest a model for hepcidin regulation of ferroportin, in which only ferroportin molecules loaded with iron are targeted for degradation. More broadly, our structural and functional insights may enable more targeted manipulation of the hepcidin-ferroportin axis in disorders of iron homeostasis."], ["Ultrafast X-ray probing of water structure below the homogeneous ice nucleation temperature", "Water has a number of anomalous physical properties, and some of these become drastically enhanced on supercooling below the freezing point. Particular interest has focused on thermodynamic response functions that can be described using a normal component and an anomalous component that seems to diverge at about 228 kelvin (refs 1-3). This has prompted debate about conflicting theories(4-12) that aim to explain many of the anomalous thermodynamic properties of water. One popular theory attributes the divergence to a phase transition between two forms of liquid water occurring in the 'no man's land' that lies below the homogeneous ice nucleation temperature (T-H) at approximately 232 kelvin(13) and above about 160 kelvin(14), and where rapid ice crystallization has prevented any measurements of the bulk liquid phase. In fact, the reliable determination of the structure of liquid water typically requires temperatures above about 250 kelvin(2,15). Water crystallization has been inhibited by using nanoconfinement(16), nanodroplets(17) and association with biomolecules(16) to give liquid samples at temperatures below T-H, but such measurements rely on nanoscopic volumes of water where the interaction with the confining surfaces makes the relevance to bulk water unclear(18). Here we demonstrate that femtosecond X-ray laser pulses can be used to probe the structure of liquid water in micrometre-sized droplets that have been evaporatively cooled(19-21) below TH. We find experimental evidence for the existence of metastable bulk liquid water down to temperatures of 227(-1)(+2) kelvin in the previously largely unexplored no man's land. We observe a continuous and accelerating increase in structural ordering on supercooling to approximately 229 kelvin, where the number of droplets containing ice crystals increases rapidly. But a few droplets remain liquid for about a millisecond even at this temperature. The hope now is that these observations and our detailed structural data will help identify those theories that best describe and explain the behaviour of water."], ["Design of functional metalloproteins", "Metalloproteins catalyse some of the most complex and important processes in nature, such as photosynthesis and water oxidation. An ultimate test of our knowledge of how metalloproteins work is to design new metalloproteins. Doing so not only can reveal hidden structural features that may be missing from studies of native metalloproteins and their variants, but also can result in new metalloenzymes for biotechnological and pharmaceutical applications. Although it is much more challenging to design metalloproteins than non-metalloproteins, much progress has been made in this area, particularly in functional design, owing to recent advances in areas such as computational and structural biology."], ["Chemical differentiation, cold storage and remobilization of magma in the Earth's crust", "The formation, storage and chemical differentiation of magma in the Earth's crust is of fundamental importance in igneous geology and volcanology. Recent data are challenging the high-melt-fraction 'magma chamber' paradigm that has underpinned models of crustal magmatism for over a century, suggesting instead that magma is normally stored in low-melt-fraction 'mush reservoirs'(1-9). A mush reservoir comprises a porous and permeable framework of closely packed crystals with melt present in the pore space(1,10). However, many common features of crustal magmatism have not yet been explained by either the 'chamber' or 'mush reservoir' concepts(1,11). Here we show that reactive melt flow is a critical, but hitherto neglected, process in crustal mush reservoirs, caused by buoyant melt percolating upwards through, and reacting with, the crystals(10). Reactive melt flow in mush reservoirs produces the low-crystallinity, chemically differentiated (silicic) magmas that ascend to form shallower intrusions or erupt to the surface(11-13). These magmas can host much older crystals, stored at low and even sub-solidus temperatures, consistent with crystal chemistry data(6-9). Changes in local bulk composition caused by reactive melt flow, rather than large increases in temperature, produce the rapid increase in melt fraction that remobilizes these cool- or cold-stored crystals. Reactive flow can also produce bimodality in magma compositions sourced from mid- to lower-crustal reservoirs(14,15). Trace-element profiles generated by reactive flow are similar to those observed in a well studied reservoir now exposed at the surface(16). We propose that magma storage and differentiation primarily occurs by reactive melt flow in long-lived mush reservoirs, rather than by the commonly invoked process of fractional crystallization in magma chambers(14)."], ["Self-powered perovskite photon-counting detectors", "Metal-halide perovskites (MHPs) have been successfully exploited for converting photons to charges or vice versa in applications of solar cells, light-emitting diodes and solar fuels(1-3), for which all these applications involve strong light. Here we show that self-powered polycrystalline perovskite photodetectors can rival the commercial silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) for photon counting. The photon-counting capability of perovskite photon-counting detectors (PCDs) is mainly determined by shallow traps, despite that deep traps also limit charge-collection efficiency. Two shallow traps with energy depth of 5.8 +/- 0.8 millielectronvolts (meV) and 57.2 +/- 0.1 meV are identified in polycrystalline methylammonium lead triiodide, which mainly stay at grain boundaries and the surface, respectively. We show that these shallow traps can be reduced by grain-size enhancement and surface passivation using diphenyl sulfide, respectively. It greatly suppresses dark count rate (DCR) from >20,000 counts per second per square millimetre (cps mm(-2)) to 2 cps mm(-2) at room temperature, enabling much better response to weak light than SiPMs. The perovskite PCDs can collect.-ray spectra with better energy resolution than SiPMs and maintain performance at high temperatures up to 85 degrees C. The zero-bias operation of perovskite detectors enables no drift of noise and detection property. This study opens a new application of photon counting for perovskites that uses their unique defect properties."], ["Anthropogenically enhanced fluxes of water and carbon from the Mississippi River", "The water and dissolved inorganic carbon exported by rivers are important net fluxes that connect terrestrial and oceanic water and carbon reservoirs(1). For most rivers, the majority of dissolved inorganic carbon is in the form of bicarbonate. The riverine bicarbonate flux originates mainly from the dissolution of rock minerals by soil water carbon dioxide, a process called chemical weathering, which controls the buffering capacity and mineral content of receiving streams and rivers(2). Here we introduce an unprecedented high- temporal- resolution, 100- year data set from the Mississippi River and couple it with sub- watershed and precipitation data to reveal that the large increase in bicarbonate flux that has occurred over the past 50 years ( ref. 3) is clearly anthropogenically driven. We show that the increase in bicarbonate and water fluxes is caused mainly by an increase in discharge from agricultural watersheds that has not been balanced by a rise in precipitation, which is also relevant to nutrient and pesticide fluxes to the Gulf of Mexico. These findings demonstrate that alterations in chemical weathering are relevant to improving contemporary biogeochemical budgets. Furthermore, land use change and management were arguably more important than changes in climate and plant CO2 fertilization to increases in riverine water and carbon export from this large region over the past 50 years."], ["Tunable non-integer high-harmonic generation in a topological insulator", "When intense lightwaves accelerate electrons through a solid, the emerging high-order harmonic (HH) radiation offers key insights into the material(1-11). Sub-optical-cycle dynamics-such as dynamical Bloch oscillations(2-5), quasiparticle collisions(6,12), valley pseudospin switching(13) and heating of Dirac gases(10)-leave fingerprints in the HH spectra of conventional solids. Topologically non-trivial matter(14,15) with invariants that are robust against imperfections has been predicted to support unconventional HH generation(16-20). Here we experimentally demonstrate HH generation in a three-dimensional topological insulator-bismuth telluride. The frequency of the terahertz driving field sharply discriminates between HH generation from the bulk and from the topological surface, where the unique combination of long scattering times owing to spin-momentum locking(17) and the quasi-relativistic dispersion enables unusually efficient HH generation. Intriguingly, all observed orders can be continuously shifted to arbitrary non-integer multiples of the driving frequency by varying the carrier-envelope phase of the driving field-in line with quantum theory. The anomalous Berry curvature warranted by the non-trivial topology enforces meandering ballistic trajectories of the Dirac fermions, causing a hallmark polarization pattern of the HH emission. Our study provides a platform to explore topology and relativistic quantum physics in strong-field control, and could lead to non-dissipative topological electronics at infrared frequencies."], ["Conductive two-dimensional titanium carbide 'clay' with high volumetric capacitance", "Safe and powerful energy storage devices are becoming increasingly important. Charging times of seconds to minutes, with power densities exceeding those of batteries, can in principle be provided by electrochemical capacitors in particular, pseudocapacitors(1,2). Recent research has focused mainly on improving the gravimetric performance of the electrodes of such systems, but for portable electronics and vehicles volume is at a premium(3). The best volumetric capacitances of carbon-based electrodes are around 300 farads per cubic centimetre(4,5); hydrated ruthenium oxide can reach capacitances of 1,000 to 1,500 farads per cubic centimetre with great cydability, but only in thin films(6) Recently, electrodes made of two-dimensional titanium carbide (Ti3C2, a member of the 'MXene' family), produced by etching aluminium from titanium aluminium carbide (Ti3AlC2, a 'MAX' phase) in concentrated hydrofluoric acid, have been shown to have volumetric capacitances of over 300 farads per cubic centimetre(7,8). Here we report a method of producing this material using a solution of lithium fluoride and hydrochloric acid. The resulting hydrophilic material swells in volume when hydrated, and can be shaped like clay and dried into a highly conductive solid or rolled into films tens of micrometres thick. Additive-free films of this titanium carbide 'clay' have volumetric capacitances of up to 900 farads per cubic centimetre, with excellent cyclability and rate performances. This capacitance is almost twice that of our previous report(8), and our synthetic method also offers a much faster route to film production as well as the avoidance of handling hazardous concentrated hydrofluoric acid."], ["Structures of riboswitch RNA reaction states by mix-and-inject XFEL serial crystallography", "Riboswitches are structural RNA elements that are generally located in the 5' untranslated region of messenger RNA. During regulation of gene expression, ligand binding to the aptamer domain of a riboswitch triggers a signal to the downstream expression platform(1-3). A complete understanding of the structural basis of this mechanism requires the ability to study structural changes over time(4). Here we use femtosecond X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) pulses(5,6) to obtain structural measurements from crystals so small that diffusion of a ligand can be timed to initiate a reaction before diffraction. We demonstrate this approach by determining four structures of the adenine riboswitch aptamer domain during the course of a reaction, involving two unbound apo structures, one ligand-bound intermediate, and the final ligand-bound conformation. These structures support a reaction mechanism model with at least four states and illustrate the structural basis of signal transmission. The three-way junction and the P1 switch helix of the two apo conformers are notably different from those in the ligand-bound conformation. Our time-resolved crystallographic measurements with a 10-second delay captured the structure of an intermediate with changes in the binding pocket that accommodate the ligand. With at least a 10-minute delay, the RNA molecules were fully converted to the ligand-bound state, in which the substantial conformational changes resulted in conversion of the space group. Such notable changes in crystallo highlight the important opportunities that micro-and nanocrystals may offer in these and similar time-resolved diffraction studies. Together, these results demonstrate the potential of 'mix-and-inject' time-resolved serial crystallography to study biochemically important interactions between biomacromolecules and ligands, including those that involve large conformational changes."], ["Tracking excited-state charge and spin dynamics in iron coordination complexes", "Crucial to many light-driven processes in transition metal complexes is the absorption and dissipation of energy by 3d electrons(1-4). But a detailed understanding of such non-equilibrium excited-state dynamics and their interplay with structural changes is challenging: a multitude of excited states and possible transitions result in phenomena too complex to unravel when faced with the indirect sensitivity of optical spectroscopy to spin dynamics(5) and the flux limitations of ultrafast X-ray sources(6,7). Such a situation exists for archetypal poly-pyridyl iron complexes, such as [Fe(2,2'-bipyridine)(3)](2+), where the excited-state charge and spin dynamics involved in the transition from a low-to a high-spin state (spin crossover) have long been a source of interest and controversy(6-15). Here we demonstrate that femtosecond resolution X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, with its sensitivity to spin state, can elucidate the spin crossover dynamics of [Fe(2,2'-bipyridine)(3)](2+) on photoinduced metal-to-ligand charge transfer excitation. We are able to track the charge and spin dynamics, and establish the critical role of intermediate spin states in the crossover mechanism. We anticipate that these capabilities will make our method a valuable tool for mapping in unprecedented detail the fundamental electronic excited-state dynamics that underpin many useful light-triggered molecular phenomena involving 3d transition metal complexes."], ["Global fine-scale changes in ambient NO<sub>2</sub> during COVID-19 lockdowns", "Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is an important contributor to air pollution and can adversely affect human health(1-9). A decrease in NO2 concentrations has been reported as a result of lockdown measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19(10-20). Questions remain, however, regarding the relationship of satellite-derived atmospheric column NO2 data with health-relevant ambient ground-level concentrations, and the representativeness of limited ground-based monitoring data for global assessment. Here we derive spatially resolved, global ground-level NO2 concentrations from NO2 column densities observed by the TROPOMI satellite instrument at sufficiently fine resolution (approximately one kilometre) to allow assessment of individual cities during COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020 compared to 2019. We apply these estimates to quantify NO2 changes in more than 200 cities, including 65 cities without available ground monitoring, largely in lower-income regions. Mean country-level population-weighted NO2 concentrations are 29% +/- 3% lower in countries with strict lockdown conditions than in those without. Relative to long-term trends, NO2 decreases during COVID-19 lockdowns exceed recent Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI)-derived year-to-year decreases from emission controls, comparable to 15 +/- 4 years of reductions globally. Our case studies indicate that the sensitivity of NO2 to lockdowns varies by country and emissions sector, demonstrating the critical need for spatially resolved observational information provided by these satellite-derived surface concentration estimates."], ["Computational approaches streamlining drug discovery", "Computer-aided drug discovery has been around for decades, although the past few years have seen a tectonic shift towards embracing computational technologies in both academia and pharma. This shift is largely defined by the flood of data on ligand properties and binding to therapeutic targets and their 3D structures, abundant computing capacities and the advent of on-demand virtual libraries of drug-like small molecules in their billions. Taking full advantage of these resources requires fast computational methods for effective ligand screening. This includes structure-based virtual screening of gigascale chemical spaces, further facilitated by fast iterative screening approaches. Highly synergistic are developments in deep learning predictions of ligand properties and target activities in lieu of receptor structure. Here we review recent advances in ligand discovery technologies, their potential for reshaping the whole process of drug discovery and development, as well as the challenges they encounter. We also discuss how the rapid identification of highly diverse, potent, target-selective and drug-like ligands to protein targets can democratize the drug discovery process, presenting new opportunities for the cost-effective development of safer and more effective small-molecule treatments."], ["Cancer-associated IDH1 mutations produce 2-hydroxyglutarate", "Mutations in the enzyme cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) are a common feature of a major subset of primary human brain cancers. These mutations occur at a single amino acid residue of the IDH1 active site, resulting in loss of the enzyme's ability to catalyse conversion of isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate. However, only a single copy of the gene is mutated in tumours, raising the possibility that the mutations do not result in a simple loss of function. Here we show that cancer-associated IDH1 mutations result in a new ability of the enzyme to catalyse the NADPH-dependent reduction of alpha-ketoglutarate to R(2)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). Structural studies demonstrate that when arginine 132 is mutated to histidine, residues in the active site are shifted to produce structural changes consistent with reduced oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate and acquisition of the ability to convert alpha-ketoglutarate to 2HG. Excess accumulation of 2HG has been shown to lead to an elevated risk of malignant brain tumours in patients with inborn errors of 2HG metabolism. Similarly, in human malignant gliomas harbouring IDH1 mutations, we find markedly elevated levels of 2HG. These data demonstrate that the IDH1 mutations result in production of the onco-metabolite 2HG, and indicate that the excess 2HG which accumulates in vivo contributes to the formation and malignant progression of gliomas."], ["TEMPO-Modified Linear Poly(ethylenimine) for Immobilization-Enhanced Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Alcohols", "We demonstrate a method to simultaneously immobilize the oxidation catalyst, TEMPO, while dramatically enhancing its electrocatalytic activity toward several biologically available alcohols.

RNAs are central to biological regulation, and the ability of RNA to adopt specific structures intimately controls every step of the gene expression program(1). However, our understanding of physiological RNA structures is limited; current in vivo RNA structure profiles include only two of the four nucleotides that make up RNA(2,3). Here we present a novel biochemical approach, in vivo click selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation and profiling experiment (icSHAPE), which enables the first global view, to our knowledge, of RNA secondary structures in living cells for all four bases. icSHAPE of the mouse embryonic stem cell transcriptome versus purified RNA folded in vitro shows that the structural dynamics of RNA in the cellular environment distinguish different classes of RNAs and regulatory elements. Structural signatures at translational start sites and ribosome pause sites are conserved from in vitro conditions, suggesting that these RNA elements are programmed by sequence. In contrast, focal structural rearrangements in vivo reveal precise interfaces of RNA with RNA-binding proteins or RNA-modification sites that are consistent with atomic-resolution structural data. Such dynamic structural footprints enable accurate prediction of RNA-protein interactions and N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) modification genome wide.

One of the best-studied lncRNAs is Xist, which is required for transcriptional silencing of one X chromosome during development in female mammals(3,4). Despite extensive efforts to define the mechanism of Xist-mediated transcriptional silencing, we still do not know any proteins required for this role(3). The main challenge is that there are currently no methods to comprehensively define the proteins that directly interact with a lncRNA in the cell(5). Here we develop a method to purify a lncRNA from cells and identify proteins interacting with it directly using quantitative mass spectrometry. We identify ten proteins that specifically associate with Xist, three of these proteins-SHARP, SAF-A and LBR-are required for Xist-mediated transcriptional silencing. We show that SHARP, which interacts with the SMRT co-repressor(6) that activates HDAC3(7), is not only essential for silencing, but is also required for the exclusion of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) from the inactive X. Both SMRT and HDAC3 are also required for silencing and Pol II exclusion. In addition to silencing transcription, SHARP and HDAC3 are required for Xist-mediated recruitment of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) across the X chromosome. Our results suggest that Xist silences transcription by directly interacting with SHARP, recruiting SMRT, activating HDAC3, and deacetylating histones to exclude Pol II across the X chromosome."], ["A stable argon compound", "The noble gases have a particularly stable electronic configuration, comprising fully filled s and p valence orbitals. This makes these elements relatively non-reactive, and they exist at room temperature as monatomic gases. Pauling predicted(1) in 1933 that the heavier noble gases, whose valence electrons are screened by core electrons and thus less strongly bound, could form stable molecules. This prediction was verified in 1962 by the preparation of xenon hexafluoroplatinate, XePtF6, the first compound to contain a noble-gas atom(2,3). Since then, a range of different compounds containing radon, xenon and krypton have been theoretically anticipated and prepared(4-8). Although the lighter noble gases neon, helium and argon are also expected to be reactive under suitable conditions(9,10), they remain the last three long-lived elements of the periodic table for which no stable compound is known. Here we report that the photolysis of hydrogen fluoride in a solid argon matrix leads to the formation of argon fluorohydride (HArF), which we have identified by probing the shift in the position of vibrational bands on isotopic substitution using infrared spectroscopy. Extensive ab initio calculations indicate that HArF is intrinsically stable, owing to significant ionic and covalent contributions to its bonding, thus confirming computational predictions(11-13) that argon should form a stable hydride species with properties similar to those of the analogous xenon and krypton compounds reported before(14-18)."], ["Shape memory polymer with programmable recovery onset", "Stimulus-responsive shape-shifting polymers1-3 have shown unique promise in emerging applications, including soft robotics4-7, medical devices8, aerospace structures9 and flexible electronics10. Their externally triggered shape-shifting behaviour offers on-demand controllability essential for many device applications. Ironically, accessing external triggers (for example, heating or light) under realistic scenarios has become the greatest bottleneck in demanding applications such as implantable medical devices8. Certain shape-shifting polymers rely on naturally present stimuli (for example, human body temperature for implantable devices)8 as triggers. Although they forgo the need for external stimulation, the ability to control recovery onset is also lost. Naturally triggered, yet actively controllable, shape-shifting behaviour is highly desirable but these two attributes are conflicting. Here we achieved this goal with a four-dimensional printable shape memory hydrogel that operates via phase separation, with its shape-shifting kinetics dominated by internal mass diffusion rather than by heat transport used for common shape memory polymers8-11. This hydrogel can undergo shape transformation at natural ambient temperature, critically with a recovery onset delay. This delay is programmable by altering the degree of phase separation during device programming, which offers a unique mechanism for shape-shifting control. Our naturally triggered shape memory polymer with a tunable recovery onset markedly lowers the barrier for device implementation. A four-dimensional printable shape memory hydrogel with shape-shifting onset adjustable by changing the programming conditions is reported."], ["Nanomechanical oscillations in a single-C<sub>60</sub> transistor", "The motion of electrons through quantum dots is strongly modified by single-electron charging and the quantization of energy levels(1,2). Much effort has been directed towards extending studies of electron transport to chemical nanostructures, including molecules(3-8), nanocrystals(9-13) and nanotubes(14-17). Here we report the fabrication of single-molecule transistors based on individual C-60 molecules connected to gold electrodes. We perform transport measurements that provide evidence for a coupling between the centre-of-mass motion of the C-60 molecules and single-electron hopping(18)-a conduction mechanism that has not been observed previously in quantum dot studies. The coupling is manifest as quantized nano-mechanical oscillations of the C-60 molecule against the gold surface, with a frequency of about 1.2 THz. This value is in good agreement with a simple theoretical estimate based on van der Waals and electrostatic interactions between C-60 molecules and gold electrodes."], ["Chromatin architecture reorganization during stem cell differentiation", "Higher-order chromatin structure is emerging as an important regulator of gene expression. Although dynamic chromatin structures have been identified in the genome, the full scope of chromatin dynamics during mammalian development and lineage specification remains to be determined. By mapping genome-wide chromatin interactions in human embryonic stem(ES) cells and four human ES-cell-derived lineages, we uncover extensive chromatin reorganization during lineage specification. We observe that although self-associating chromatin domains are stable during differentiation, chromatin interactions both within and between domains change in a striking manner, altering 36% of active and inactive chromosomal compartments throughout the genome. By integrating chromatin interaction maps with haplotype-resolved epigenome and transcriptome data sets, we find widespread allelic bias in gene expression correlated with allele-biased chromatin states of linked promoters and distal enhancers. Our results therefore provide a global view of chromatin dynamics and a resource for studying long-range control of gene expression in distinct human cell lineages."], ["Ancient proteins resolve the evolutionary history of Darwin's South American ungulates", "No large group of recently extinct placental mammals remains as evolutionarily cryptic as the approximately 280 genera grouped as 'South American native ungulates'. To Charles Darwin(1,)2, who first collected their remains, they included perhaps the 'strangest animal[s] ever discovered'. Today, much like 180 years ago, it is no clearer whether they had one origin or several, arose before or after the Cretaceous/Palaeogene transition 66.2 million years ago(3), or are more likely to belong with the elephants and sirenians of superorder Afrotheria than with the euungulates (cattle, horses, and allies) of superorder Laurasiatheria(4-6). Morphology-based analyses have proved unconvincing because convergences are pervasive among unrelated ungulate-like placentals. Approaches using ancient DNA have also been unsuccessful, probably because of rapid DNA degradation in semitropical and temperate deposits. Here we apply proteomic analysis to screen bone samples of the Late Quaternary South American native ungulate taxa Toxodon (Notoungulata) and Macrauchenia (Litopterna) for phylogenetically informative protein sequences. For each ungulate, we obtain approximately 90% direct sequence coverage of type I collagen alpha 1-and alpha 2-chains, representing approximately 900 of 1,140 amino-acid residues for each subunit. A phylogeny is estimated from an alignment of these fossil sequences with collagen (I) gene transcripts from available mammalian genomes or mass spectrometrically derived sequence data obtained for this study. The resulting consensus tree agrees well with recent higher-level mammalian phylogenies(7-9). Toxodon and Macrauchenia form a monophyletic group whose sister taxon is not Afrotheria or any of its constituent clades as recently claimed(5,6), but instead crown Perissodactyla (horses, tapirs, and rhinoceroses). These results are consistent with the origin of at least some South American native ungulates(4,6) from 'condylarths', a paraphyletic assembly of archaic placentals. With ongoing improvements in instrumentation and analytical procedures, proteomics may produce a revolution in systematics such as that achieved by genomics, but with the possibility of reaching much further back in time."], ["Strong, light, multifunctional fibers of carbon nanotubes with ultrahigh conductivity", "Broader applications of carbon nanotubes to real-world problems have largely gone unfulfilled because of difficult material synthesis and laborious processing.

The dopamine transporter is an obligatory target of cocaine and amphetamine, as these psychostimulants have no effect on locomotor activity or dopamine release and uptake in mice lacking the transporter."], ["JAZ repressor proteins are targets of the SCF<SUP>CO11</SUP> complex during jasmonate signalling", "Jasmonate and related signalling compounds have a crucial role in both host immunity and development in plants, but the molecular details of the signalling mechanism are poorly understood. Here we identify members of the jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) protein family as key regulators of jasmonate signalling. JAZ1 protein acts to repress transcription of jasmonate-responsive genes. Jasmonate treatment causes JAZ1 degradation and this degradation is dependent on activities of the SCFCOI1 ubiquitin ligase and the 26S proteasome. Furthermore, the jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile) conjugate, but not other jasmonate-derivatives such as jasmonate, 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid, or methyl-jasmonate, promotes physical interaction between COI1 and JAZ1 proteins in the absence of other plant proteins. Our results suggest a model in which jasmonate ligands promote the binding of the SCF COI1 ubiquitin ligase to and subsequent degradation of the JAZ1 repressor protein, and implicate the SCFCOI1-JAZ1 protein complex as a site of perception of the plant hormone JA-Ile."], ["Discovery and engineering of colchicine alkaloid biosynthesis", "Discovery of a near-complete colchicine biosynthetic pathway enables the engineered production of the tropolone-containing alkaloidN-formyldemecolcine from amino acid precursors inNicotiana benthamiana. Few complete pathways have been established for the biosynthesis of medicinal compounds from plants. Accordingly, many plant-derived therapeutics are isolated directly from medicinal plants or plant cell culture(1). A lead example is colchicine, a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for inflammatory disorders that is sourced fromColchicumandGloriosaspecies(2-5). Here we use a combination of transcriptomics, metabolic logic and pathway reconstitution to elucidate a near-complete biosynthetic pathway to colchicine without prior knowledge of biosynthetic genes, a sequenced genome or genetic tools in the native host. We uncovered eight genes fromGloriosa superbafor the biosynthesis ofN-formyldemecolcine, a colchicine precursor that contains the characteristic tropolone ring and pharmacophore of colchicine(6). Notably, we identified a non-canonical cytochrome P450 that catalyses the remarkable ring expansion reaction that is required to produce the distinct carbon scaffold of colchicine. We further used the newly identified genes to engineer a biosynthetic pathway (comprising 16 enzymes in total) toN-formyldemecolcine inNicotiana benthamianastarting from the amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine.

Herein, we report our effort to control Ca-ion speciation in ionic liquid (IL) based electrolytes through the design of alkoxy-functionalized cations. Quantitative analysis reveals that the alkoxy-functionalized ammonium cation (N07+), bearing seven ether oxygen atoms, can effectively displace the bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anion (TFSI\u2212) from the Ca2+ ion coordination sphere, facilitating the reversible Ca deposition/stripping process. More importantly, post-analysis of Ca deposits surface chemistry and density functional theory calculations of Ca-ion speciation indicate the formation of an organic-rich, but inorganic-poor solid electrolyte interphase layer, which enables Ca2+ ion diffusion rather than passivating the Ca metal electrode. Finally, as a proof-of-concept, a prototype Ca/V2O5 cell using the optimized IL-based electrolyte ([Ca(BH4)2]0.05[N07TFSI]0.95) is demonstrated for the first time, exhibiting a remarkable initial discharge capacity of 332 mA h g\u22121 and reversible capacity of 244 mA h g\u22121."], ["Coherently wired light-harvesting in photosynthetic marine algae at ambient temperature", "Photosynthesis makes use of sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into useful biomass and is vital for life on Earth. Crucial components for the photosynthetic process are antenna proteins, which absorb light and transmit the resultant excitation energy between molecules to a reaction centre. The efficiency of these electronic energy transfers has inspired much work on antenna proteins isolated from photosynthetic organisms to uncover the basic mechanisms at play(1-5). Intriguingly, recent work has documented(6-8) that light-absorbing molecules in some photosynthetic proteins capture and transfer energy according to quantum-mechanical probability laws instead of classical laws(9) at temperatures up to 180 K. This contrasts with the long-held view that long-range quantum coherence between molecules cannot be sustained in complex biological systems, even at low temperatures. Here we present two-dimensional photon echo spectroscopy(10-13) measurements on two evolutionarily related light-harvesting proteins isolated from marine cryptophyte algae, which reveal exceptionally long-lasting excitation oscillations with distinct correlations and anti-correlations even at ambient temperature. These observations provide compelling evidence for quantum-coherent sharing of electronic excitation across the 5-nm-wide proteins under biologically relevant conditions, suggesting that distant molecules within the photosynthetic proteins are 'wired' together by quantum coherence for more efficient light-harvesting in cryptophyte marine algae."], ["Convergence of electronic bands for high performance bulk thermoelectrics", "Thermoelectric generators, which directly convert heat into electricity, have long been relegated to use in space-based or other niche applications, but are now being actively considered for a variety of practical waste heat recovery systems-such as the conversion of car exhaust heat into electricity. Although these devices can be very reliable and compact, the thermoelectric materials themselves are relatively inefficient: to facilitate widespread application, it will be desirable to identify or develop materials that have an intensive thermoelectric materials figure of merit, zT, above 1.5 (ref. 1). Many different concepts have been used in the search for new materials with high thermoelectric efficiency, such as the use of nanostructuring to reduce phonon thermal conductivity(2-4), which has led to the investigation of a variety of complex material systems(5). In this vein, it is well known(6,7) that a high valley degeneracy (typically <= 6 for known thermoelectrics) in the electronic bands is conducive to high zT, and this in turn has stimulated attempts to engineer such degeneracy by adopting low-dimensional nanostructures(8-10). Here we demonstrate that it is possible to direct the convergence of many valleys in a bulk material by tuning the doping and composition. By this route, we achieve a convergence of at least 12 valleys in doped PbTe(1-x)Se(x) alloys, leading to an extraordinary zT value of 1.8 at about 850 kelvin. Band engineering to converge the valence (or conduction) bands to achieve high valley degeneracy should be a general strategy in the search for and improvement of bulk thermoelectric materials, because it simultaneously leads to a high Seebeck coefficient and high electrical conductivity."], ["Synthesis of the H-cluster framework of iron-only hydrogenase", "The metal- sulphur active sites of hydrogenases catalyse hydrogen evolution or uptake at rapid rates. Understanding the structure and function of these active sites - through mechanistic studies of hydrogenases(1 - 4), synthetic assemblies(5 - 12) and in silico models(13 - 15) - will help guide the design of new materials for hydrogen production or uptake(16). Here we report the assembly of the iron- sulphur framework of the active site of iron- only hydrogenase ( the H- cluster), and show that it functions as an electrocatalyst for proton reduction. Through linking of a di- iron subsite to a {4Fe4S} cluster, we achieve the first synthesis of a metallosulphur cluster core involved in small- molecule catalysis. In addition to advancing our understanding of the natural biological system, the availability of an active, free- standing analogue of the H- cluster may enable us to develop useful electrocatalytic materials for application in, for example, reversible hydrogen fuel cells.

So far, however, such systems have been largely restricted to pure oxygen environments (lithium oxygen batteries) and have a limited cycle life owing to side reactions involving the cathode, anode and electrolyte(2-5). In the presence of nitrogen, carbon dioxide and water vapour, these side reactions can become even more complex(6-11). Moreover, because of the need to store oxygen, the volumetric energy densities of lithium-oxygen systems may be too small for practical applications(12). Here we report a system comprising a lithium carbonate-based protected anode, a molybdenum disulfide cathode(2) and an ionic liquid/di methyl sulfoxide electrolyte that operates as a lithium-air battery in a simulated air atmosphere with a long cycle life of up to 700 cycles. We perform computational studies to provide insight into the operation of the system in this environment.

In particular, magnetic fields offer a safe and effective manipulation method for biomedical applications, which typically require remote actuation in enclosed and confined spaces(8-10). With advances in magnetic field control11, magnetically responsive soft materials have also evolved from embedding discrete magnets(12) or incorporating magnetic particles(13) into soft compounds to generating nonuniform magnetization profiles in polymeric sheets(14,15). Here we report 3D printing of programmed ferromagnetic domains in soft materials that enable fast transformations between complex 3D shapes via magnetic actuation. Our approach is based on direct ink writing(16) of an elastomer composite containing ferromagnetic microparticles. By applying a magnetic field to the dispensing nozzle while printing(17), we reorient particles along the applied field to impart patterned magnetic polarity to printed filaments. This method allows us to program ferromagnetic domains in complex 3D-printed soft materials, enabling a set of previously inaccessible modes of transformation, such as remotely controlled auxetic behaviours of mechanical metamaterials with negative Poisson's ratios. The actuation speed and power density of our printed soft materials with programmed ferromagnetic domains are orders of magnitude greater than existing 3D-printed active materials.

Analysis of the gene set yields insights into unexpected aspects of Neurospora biology including the identification of genes potentially associated with red light photobiology, genes implicated in secondary metabolism, and important differences in Ca2+ signalling as compared with plants and animals. Neurospora possesses the widest array of genome defence mechanisms known for any eukaryotic organism, including a process unique to fungi called repeat-induced point mutation (RIP).

We discovered that, at high salt concentrations (from 10 to 21 mol/kg), a disproportion of cation solvation occurs, leading to a liquid structure of heterogeneous domains with a characteristic length scale of 1 to 2 nm. This unusual nano-heterogeneity effectively decouples cations from the Coulombic traps of anions and provides a 3D percolating lithium\u2013water network, via which 40% of the lithium cations are liberated for fast ion transport even in concentration ranges traditionally considered too viscous. Due to such percolation networks, superconcentrated aqueous electrolytes are characterized by a high lithium-transference number (0.73), which is key to supporting an assortment of battery chemistries at high rate. The in-depth understanding of this transport mechanism establishes guiding principles to the tailored design of future superconcentrated electrolyte systems."], ["Structural superlubricity and ultralow friction across the length scales", "Structural superlubricity, a state of ultralow friction and wear between crystalline surfaces, is a fundamental phenomenon in modern tribology that defines a new approach to lubrication.

This is an important step towards practical utilization of structural superlubricity in future technological applications, such as durable nano- and micro-electromechanical devices, hard drives, mobile frictionless connectors, and mechanical bearings operating under extreme conditions.

These extra degrees of freedom enable the detection and correction of errors, but also increase the control complexity of the encoded logical qubit. Fault-tolerant circuits contain the spread of errors while controlling the logical qubit, and are essential for realizing error suppression in practice(3-6). Although fault-tolerant design works in principle, it has not previously been demonstrated in an error-corrected physical system with native noise characteristics. Here we experimentally demonstrate fault-tolerant circuits for the preparation, measurement, rotation and stabilizer measurement of a Bacon-Shor logical qubit using 13 trapped ion qubits. When we compare these fault-tolerant protocols to non-fault-tolerant protocols, we see significant reductions in the error rates of the logical primitives in the presence of noise. The result of fault-tolerant design is an average state preparation and measurement error of 0.6 per cent and a Clifford gate error of 0.3 per cent after offline error correction. In addition, we prepare magic states with fidelities that exceed the distillation threshold(7), demonstrating all of the key single-qubit ingredients required for universal fault-tolerant control. These results demonstrate that fault-tolerant circuits enable highly accurate logical primitives in current quantum systems.

Intrinsic chirality is weak in natural materials, and recent theoretical proposals(5-7) aimed to enlarge circular dichroism by resonant metasurfaces supporting bound states in the continuum that enhance substantially chiral light-matter interactions. Those insightful works resort to three-dimensional sophisticated geometries, which are too challenging to be realized for optical frequencies(8). Therefore, most of the experimental attempts(9-11) showing strong circular dichroism rely on false/extrinsic chirality by using either oblique incidence(9,10) or structural anisotropy(11). Here we report on the experimental realization of true/intrinsic chiral response with resonant metasurfaces in which the engineered slant geometry breaks both in-plane and out-of-plane symmetries. Our result marks, to our knowledge, the first observation of intrinsic chiral bound states in the continuum with near-unity circular dichroism of 0.93 and a high quality factor exceeding 2,663 for visible frequencies.

At low ATP concentrations, the motor rotates in discrete 120 degrees steps, consistent with sequential ATP hydrolysis on the three beta -subunits. The mechanism of stepping is unknown. Here we show by high-speed imaging that the 120 degrees step consists of roughly 90 degrees and 30 degrees substeps, each taking only a fraction of a millisecond. ATP binding drives the 90 degrees substep, and the 30 degrees substep is probably driven by release of a hydrolysis product. The two substeps are separated by two reactions of about 1 ms, which together occupy most of the ATP hydrolysis cycle. This scheme probably applies to rotation at full speed (similar to 130 revolutions per second at saturating ATP) down to occasional stepping at nanomolar ATP concentrations, and supports the binding-change model for ATP synthesis by reverse rotation of F-1-ATPase."], ["Vertical full-colour micro-LEDs via 2D materials-based layer transfer", "Micro-LEDs (mu LEDs) have been explored for augmented and virtual reality display applications that require extremely high pixels per inch and luminance(1,2). However, conventional manufacturing processes based on the lateral assembly of red, green and blue (RGB) mu LEDs have limitations in enhancing pixel density(3-6). Recent demonstrations of vertical mu LED displays have attempted to address this issue by stacking freestanding RGB LED membranes and fabricating top-down(7-14), but minimization of the lateral dimensions of stacked mu LEDs has been difficult. Here we report full-colour, vertically stacked mu LEDs that achieve, to our knowledge, the highest array density (5,100 pixels per inch) and the smallest size (4 mu m) reported to date. This is enabled by a two-dimensional materials-based layer transfer technique(15-18) that allows the growth of RGB LEDs of near-submicron thickness on two-dimensional material-coated substrates via remote or van der Waals epitaxy, mechanical release and stacking of LEDs, followed by top-down fabrication. The smallest-ever stack height of around 9 mu m is the key enabler for record high mu LED array density. We also demonstrate vertical integration of blue mu LEDs with silicon membrane transistors for active matrix operation. These results establish routes to creating full-colour mu LED displays for augmented and virtual reality, while also offering a generalizable platform for broader classes of three-dimensional integrated devices."], ["Role of YAP/TAZ in mechanotransduction", "Cells perceive their microenvironment not only through soluble signals but also through physical and mechanical cues, such as extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness or confined adhesiveness. By mechanotransduction systems, cells translate these stimuli into biochemical signals controlling multiple aspects of cell behaviour, including growth, differentiation and cancer malignant progression, but how rigidity mechanosensing is ultimately linked to activity of nuclear transcription factors remains poorly understood. Here we report the identification of the Yorkie-homologues YAP (Yes-associated protein) and TAZ (transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif, also known as WWTR1) as nuclear relays of mechanical signals exerted by ECM rigidity and cell shape. This regulation requires Rho GTPase activity and tension of the actomyosin cytoskeleton, but is independent of the Hippo/LATS cascade. Crucially, YAP/TAZ are functionally required for differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells induced by ECM stiffness and for survival of endothelial cells regulated by cell geometry; conversely, expression of activated YAP overrules physical constraints in dictating cell behaviour.

However, the rational design of local flexibility in the MOF framework for dynamic molecular sieving remains difficult and challenging. Here we report a MOF material (JNU-3a) featuring one-dimension channels with embedded molecular pockets opening to propylene (C3H6) and propane (C3H8) at substantially different pressures. The dynamic nature of the pockets is revealed by single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation upon exposure of JNU-3a to an atmosphere of C3H6 or C3H8. Breakthrough experiments demonstrate that JNU-3a can realize high-purity C3H6 (>= 99.5%) in a single adsorption-desorption cycle from an equimolar C3H6/C3H8 mixture over a broad range of flow rates, with a maximum C3H6 productivity of 53.5 litres per kilogram.

Gasdermin E (GSDME, also known as DFNA5)-mutated in familial ageing-related hearing loss(2)-can be cleaved by caspase 3, thereby converting noninflammatory apoptosis to pyroptosis in GSDME-expressing cells(3-5). GSDME expression is suppressed in many cancers, and reduced GSDME levels are associated with decreased survival as a result of breast cancer(2,6), suggesting that GSDME might be a tumour suppressor. Here we show that 20 of 22 tested cancer-associated GSDME mutations reduce GSDME function. In mice, knocking out Gsdme in GSDME-expressing tumours enhances, whereas ectopic expression in Gsdme-repressed tumours inhibits, tumour growth. This tumour suppression is mediated by killer cytotoxic lymphocytes: it is abrogated in perforin-deficient mice or mice depleted of killer lymphocytes. GSDME expression enhances the phagocytosis of tumour cells by tumour-associated macrophages, as well as the number and functions of tumour-infiltrating natural-killer and CD8(+) T lymphocytes. Killer-cell granzyme B also activates caspase-independent pyroptosis in target cells by directly cleaving GSDME at the same site as caspase 3. Uncleavable or pore-defective GSDME proteins are not tumour suppressive. Thus, tumour GSDME acts as a tumour suppressor by activating pyroptosis, enhancing anti-tumour immunity. The gasdermin E protein is shown to act as a tumour suppressor: it is cleaved by caspase 3 and granzyme B and leads to pyroptosis of cancer cells, provoking an immune response to the tumour."], ["Spawning rings of exceptional points out of Dirac cones", "The Dirac cone underlies many unique electronic properties of graphene(1) and topological insulators, and its band structure-two conical bands touching at a single point-has also been realized for photons in waveguide arrays(2), atoms in optical lattices(3), and through accidental degeneracy(4,5). Deformation of the Dirac cone often reveals intriguing properties; an example is the quantum Hall effect, where a constant magnetic field breaks the Dirac cone into isolated Landau levels. A seemingly unrelated phenomenon is the exceptional point(6,7), also known as the parity-time symmetry breaking point(8-11), where two resonances coincide in both their positions and widths. Exceptional points lead to counter-intuitive phenomena such as loss-induced transparency(12), unidirectional transmission or reflection(11,13,14), and lasers with reversed pump dependence(15) or single-mode operation(16,17). Dirac cones and exceptional points are connected: it was theoretically suggested that certain non-Hermitian perturbations can deform a Dirac cone and spawn a ring of exceptional points(18-20). Here we experimentally demonstrate such an 'exceptional ring' in a photonic crystal slab. Angle-resolved reflection measurements of the photonic crystal slab reveal that the peaks of reflectivity follow the conical band structure of a Dirac cone resulting from accidental degeneracy, whereas the complex eigenvalues of the system are deformed into a two-dimensional flat band enclosed by an exceptional ring. This deformation arises from the dissimilar radiation rates of dipole and quadrupole resonances, which play a role analogous to the loss and gain in parity-time symmetric systems. Our results indicate that the radiation existing in any open system can fundamentally alter its physical properties in ways previously expected only in the presence of material loss and gain."], ["Mapping intact protein isoforms in discovery mode using top-down proteomics", "A full description of the human proteome relies on the challenging task of detecting mature and changing forms of protein molecules in the body. Large-scale proteome analysis(1) has routinely involved digesting intact proteins followed by inferred protein identification using mass spectrometry(2). This 'bottom-up' process affords a high number of identifications (not always unique to a single gene). However, complications arise from incomplete or ambiguous(2) characterization of alternative splice forms, diverse modifications (for example, acetylation and methylation) and endogenous protein cleavages, especially when combinations of these create complex patterns of intact protein isoforms and species(3). 'Top-down' interrogation of whole proteins can overcome these problems for individual proteins(4,5), but has not been achieved on a proteome scale owing to the lack of intact protein fractionation methods that are well integrated with tandem mass spectrometry. Here we show, using a new four-dimensional separation system, identification of 1,043 gene products from human cells that are dispersed into more than 3,000 protein species created by post-translational modification (PTM), RNA splicing and proteolysis. The overall system produced greater than 20-fold increases in both separation power and proteome coverage, enabling the identification of proteins up to 105 kDa and those with up to 11 transmembrane helices. Many previously undetected isoforms of endogenous human proteins were mapped, including changes in multiply modified species in response to accelerated cellular ageing (senescence) induced by DNA damage. Integrated with the latest version of the Swiss-Prot database(6), the data provide precise correlations to individual genes and proof-of-concept for large-scale interrogation of whole protein molecules. The technology promises to improve the link between proteomics data and complex phenotypes in basic biology and disease research(7)."], ["Editing-defective tRNA synthetase causes protein misfolding and neurodegeneration", "Misfolded proteins are associated with several pathological conditions including neurodegeneration. Although some of these abnormally folded proteins result from mutations in genes encoding disease-associated proteins (for example, repeat-expansion diseases), more general mechanisms that lead to misfolded proteins in neurons remain largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that low levels of mischarged transfer RNAs (tRNAs) can lead to an intracellular accumulation of misfolded proteins in neurons. These accumulations are accompanied by upregulation of cytoplasmic protein chaperones and by induction of the unfolded protein response. We report that the mouse sticky mutation, which causes cerebellar Purkinje cell loss and ataxia, is a missense mutation in the editing domain of the alanyl-tRNA synthetase gene that compromises the proofreading activity of this enzyme during aminoacylation of tRNAs. These findings demonstrate that disruption of translational fidelity in terminally differentiated neurons leads to the accumulation of misfolded proteins and cell death, and provide a novel mechanism underlying neurodegeneration."], ["Active genes are tri-methylated at K4 of histone H3", "Lysine methylation of histones in vivo occurs in three states: mono-, di- and tri-methyl(1). Histone H3 has been found to be dimethylated at lysine 4 (K4) in active euchromatic regions but not in silent heterochromatic sites(2). Here we show that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Set1 protein can catalyse di- and tri- methylation of K4 and stimulate the activity of many genes. Using antibodies that discriminate between the di- and tri- methylated state of K4 we show that di- methylation occurs at both inactive and active euchromatic genes, whereas tri- methylation is present exclusively at active genes. It is therefore the presence of a trimethylated K4 that defines an active state of gene expression. These findings establish the concept of methyl status as a determinant for gene activity and thus extend considerably the complexity of histone modifications."], ["Genomic deletion of malic enzyme 2 confers collateral lethality in pancreatic cancer", "The genome of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) frequently contains deletions of tumour suppressor gene loci, most notably SMAD4, which is homozygously deleted in nearly one-third of cases(1). As loss of neighbouring housekeeping genes can confer collateral lethality, we sought to determine whether loss of the metabolic gene malic enzyme 2 (ME2) in the SMAD4 locus would create cancer-specific metabolic vulnerability upon targeting of its paralogous isoform ME3. The mitochondrial malic enzymes (ME2 and ME3) are oxidative decarboxylases that catalyse the conversion of malate to pyruvate and are essential for NADPH regeneration and reactive oxygen species homeostasis(2,3). Here we show that ME3 depletion selectively kills ME2-null PDAC cells in a manner consistent with an essential function for ME3 in ME2-null cancer cells. Mechanistically, integrated metabolomic and molecular investigation of cells deficient in mitochondrial malic enzymes revealed diminished NADPH production and consequent high levels of reactive oxygen species. These changes activate AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), which in turn directly suppresses sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1)-directed transcription of its direct targets including the BCAT2 branched-chain amino acid transaminase 2) gene. BCAT2 catalyses the transfer of the amino group from branched-chain amino acids to a-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG)(4) thereby regenerating glutamate, which functions in part to support de novo nucleotide synthesis. Thus, mitochondrial malic enzyme deficiency, which results in impaired NADPH production, provides a prime 'collateral lethality' therapeutic strategy for the treatment of a substantial fraction of patients diagnosed with this intractable disease."], ["Si=P Double Bonds: Experimental and Theoretical Study of an NHC-Stabilized Phosphasilenylidene", "An experimental and theoretical study of the first compound featuring a Si\uf8feP bond to a two-coordinate silicon atom is reported. The NHC-stabilized phosphasilenylidene (IDipp)Si\uf8fePMes* (IDipp=1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin-2-ylidene, Mes*=2,4,6-tBu3C6H2) was prepared by SiMe3Cl elimination from SiCl2(IDipp) and LiP(Mes*)SiMe3 and characterized by X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and UV/Vis spectroscopy. It has a planar trans-bent geometry with a short Si\uf8ffP distance of 2.1188(7)\u2005\u00c5 and acute bonding angles at Si (96.90(6)\u00b0) and P (95.38(6)\u00b0). The bonding parameters indicate the presence of a Si\uf8feP bond with a lone electron pair of high s-character at Si and P, in agreement with natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis. Comparative cyclic voltammetric and UV/Vis spectroscopic experiments of this compound, the disilicon(0) compound (IDipp)Si\uf8feSi(IDipp), and the diphosphene Mes*P\uf8fePMes* reveal, in combination with quantum chemical calculations, the isolobal relationship of the three double-bond systems."], ["The tomato genome sequence provides insights into fleshy fruit evolution", "Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is a major crop plant and a model system for fruit development. Solanum is one of the largest angiosperm genera(1) and includes annual and perennial plants from diverse habitats. Here we present a high-quality genome sequence of domesticated tomato, a draft sequence of its closest wild relative, Solanum pimpinellifolium(2), and compare them to each other and to the potato genome (Solanum tuberosum). The two tomato genomes show only 0.6% nucleotide divergence and signs of recent admixture, but show more than 8% divergence from potato, with nine large and several smaller inversions. In contrast to Arabidopsis, but similar to soybean, tomato and potato small RNAs map predominantly to gene-rich chromosomal regions, including gene promoters. The Solanum lineage has experienced two consecutive genome triplications: one that is ancient and shared with rosids, and a more recent one. These triplications set the stage for the neofunctionalization of genes controlling fruit characteristics, such as colour and fleshiness."], ["A single-cell atlas of the airway epithelium reveals the CFTR-rich pulmonary ionocyte", "The functions of epithelial tissues are dictated by the types, abundance and distribution of the differentiated cells they contain. Attempts to restore tissue function after damage require knowledge of how physiological tasks are distributed among cell types, and how cell states vary between homeostasis, injury-repair and disease. In the conducting airway, a heterogeneous basal cell population gives rise to specialized luminal cells that perform mucociliary clearance(1). Here we perform single-cell profiling of human bronchial epithelial cells and mouse tracheal epithelial cells to obtain a comprehensive census of cell types in the conducting airway and their behaviour in homeostasis and regeneration. Our analysis reveals cell states that represent known and novel cell populations, delineates their heterogeneity and identifies distinct differentiation trajectories during homeostasis and tissue repair. Finally, we identified a novel, rare cell type that we call the 'pulmonary ionocyte', which co-expresses FOXI1, multiple subunits of the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) and CFTR, the gene that is mutated in cystic fibrosis. Using immunofluorescence, modulation of signalling pathways and electrophysiology, we show that Notch signalling is necessary and FOXI1 expression is sufficient to drive the production of the pulmonary ionocyte, and that the pulmonary ionocyte is a major source of CFTR activity in the conducting airway epithelium."], ["Controlling photons using electromagnetically induced transparency", "It is well known that a dielectric medium can be used to manipulate properties of light pulses. However, optical absorption limits the extent of possible control: this is especially important for weak light pulses. Absorption in an opaque medium can be eliminated via quantum mechanical interference, an effect known as electromagnetically induced transparency. Theoretical and experimental work has demonstrated that this phenomenon can be used to slow down light pulses dramatically, or even bring them to a complete halt. Interactions between photons in such an atomic medium can be many orders of magnitude stronger than in conventional optical materials."], ["Molecular classification of cutaneous malignant melanoma by gene expression profiling", "The most common human cancers are malignant neoplasms of the skin(1,2). Incidence of cutaneous melanoma is rising especially steeply, with minimal progress in non-surgical treatment of advanced disease(3,4). Despite significant effort to identify independent predictors of melanoma outcome, no accepted histopathological, molecular or immunohistochemical marker defines subsets of this neoplasm(2,3). Accordingly, though melanoma is thought to present with different 'taxonomic' forms, these are considered part of a continuous spectrum rather than discrete entities(2). Here we report the discovery of a subset of melanomas identified by mathematical analysis of gene expression in a series of samples. Remarkably, many genes underlying the classification of this subset are differentially regulated in invasive melanomas that form primitive tubular networks in vitro, a feature of some highly aggressive metastatic melanomas(5). Global transcript analysis can identify unrecognized subtypes of cutaneous melanoma and predict experimentally verifiable phenotypic characteristics that may be of importance to disease progression."], ["Observation of superconducting diode effect", "Nonlinear optical and electrical effects associated with a lack of spatial inversion symmetry allow direction-selective propagation and transport of quantum particles, such as photons(1) and electrons(2-9). The most common example of such nonreciprocal phenomena is a semiconductor diode with a p-n junction, with a low resistance in one direction and a high resistance in the other. Although the diode effect forms the basis of numerous electronic components, such as rectifiers, alternating-direct-current converters and photodetectors, it introduces an inevitable energy loss due to the finite resistance. Therefore, a worthwhile goal is to realize a superconducting diode that has zero resistance in only one direction. Here we demonstrate a magnetically controllable superconducting diode in an artificial superlattice [Nb/V/Ta](n) without a centre of inversion. The nonreciprocal resistance versus current curve at the superconducting-to-normal transition was clearly observed by a direct-current measurement, and the difference of the critical current is considered to be related to the magnetochiral anisotropy caused by breaking of the spatial-inversion and time-reversal symmetries(10-13). Owing to the nonreciprocal critical current, the [Nb/V/Ta](n) superlattice exhibits zero resistance in only one direction. This superconducting diode effect enables phase-coherent and direction-selective charge transport, paving the way for the construction of non-dissipative electronic circuits."], ["Renewable and recyclable covalent adaptable networks based on bio-derived lipoic acid", "The modern materials economy is inefficient since most products are principally derived from non-renewable feedstocks and largely single-use in nature. Conventional thermoset materials are often inherently unreprocessable due to their irreversible covalent crosslinks and hence are challenging to recycle and/or reprocess. Covalent adaptable networks (CAN)s, which incorporate reversible or dynamic covalent bonding, have emerged as an efficient means to afford reprocessable crosslinked materials and increasing the feedstock sustainability of CANs is a developing aim. In this study, the biomass-derived lipoic acid, which possesses a dynamic cyclic disulfide moiety, was transformed into a series of bifunctional monomers via a one-step esterification or amidation reaction and reacted with a commercially available multi-valent thiol in the presence of an organobase catalyst to afford dynamically crosslinked networks. Large differences in material properties, such as storage modulus and glass transition temperature, were observed when the ratio of the lipoic acid-based monomer to thiol (from 1\u2006:\u20061 to 16\u2006:\u20061) and the composition of the monomer were changed to modify the network architecture. The thermomechanical properties of an optimised formulation were investigated more thoroughly to reveal a moderately strong rubber (ultimate tensile strength = 1.8 \u00b1 0.4 MPa) possessing a large rubbery plateau (from 0 to 150 \u00b0C) which provides an adaptable material with a wide operational temperature range. Finally, the chemical recycling, or depolymerisation, of the optimised network was also demonstrated by simply solvating the material in the presence of an organobase catalyst."], ["Genome-centric view of carbon processing in thawing permafrost", "As global temperatures rise, large amounts of carbon sequestered in permafrost are becoming available for microbial degradation. Accurate prediction of carbon gas emissions from thawing permafrost is limited by our understanding of these microbial communities. Here we use metagenomic sequencing of 214 samples from a permafrost thaw gradient to recover 1,529 metagenome-assembled genomes, including many from phyla with poor genomic representation. These genomes reflect the diversity of this complex ecosystem, with genus-level representatives for more than sixty per cent of the community. Meta-omic analysis revealed key populations involved in the degradation of organic matter, including bacteria whose genomes encode a previously undescribed fungal pathway for xylose degradation. Microbial and geochemical data highlight lineages that correlate with the production of greenhouse gases and indicate novel syntrophic relationships. Our findings link changing biogeochemistry to specific microbial lineages involved in carbon processing, and provide key information for predicting the effects of climate change on permafrost systems."], ["Protein folding and misfolding", "The manner in which a newly synthesized chain of amino acids transforms itself into a perfectly folded protein depends both on the intrinsic properties of the amino-acid sequence and on multiple contributing influences from the crowded cellular milieu. Folding and unfolding are crucial ways of regulating biological activity and targeting proteins to different cellular locations. Aggregation of misfolded proteins that escape the cellular quality-control mechanisms is a common feature of a wide range of highly debilitating and increasingly prevalent diseases."], ["Silica-Like Malleable Materials from Permanent Organic Networks", "Permanently cross-linked materials have outstanding mechanical properties and solvent resistance, but they cannot be processed and reshaped once synthesized. Non\u2013cross-linked polymers and those with reversible cross-links are processable, but they are soluble. We designed epoxy networks that can rearrange their topology by exchange reactions without depolymerization and showed that they are insoluble and processable. Unlike organic compounds and polymers whose viscosity varies abruptly near the glass transition, these networks show Arrhenius-like gradual viscosity variations like those of vitreous silica. Like silica, the materials can be wrought and welded to make complex objects by local heating without the use of molds. The concept of a glass made by reversible topology freezing in epoxy networks can be readily scaled up for applications and generalized to other chemistries."], ["Distal radical migration strategy: an emerging synthetic means", "The remote radical migration strategy has gained considerable momentum. During the past three years, we have witnessed the rapid development of sustainable and practical C\u2013C and C\u2013H bond functionalization by means of long-distance 1,n-radical migration (n = 4, 5, 6) events. Its advent brings our chemical community a new platform to deal with the challenging migration transformations and thus complements the existing ionic-type migration protocols. In this review, the recent achievements in distal radical migration triggered C\u2013C and C\u2013H bond functionalization are summarized."], ["Superconductivity in alkali-metal-doped picene", "Efforts to identify and develop new superconducting materials continue apace, motivated by both fundamental science and the prospects for application. For example, several new superconducting material systems have been developed in the recent past, including calcium-intercalated graphite compounds(1), boron-doped diamond(2) and-most prominently-iron arsenides such as LaO1-xFxFeAs (ref. 3). In the case of organic superconductors, however, no new material system with a high superconducting transition temperature (T-c) has been discovered in the past decade. Here we report that intercalating an alkali metal into picene, a wide-bandgap semiconducting solid hydrocarbon, produces metallic behaviour and superconductivity. Solid potassium-intercalated picene (K(x)picene) shows T-c values of 7K and 18 K, depending on the metal content. The drop of magnetization in Kxpicene solids at the transition temperature is sharp (<2 K), similar to the behaviour of Ca-intercalated graphite(1). The Tc of 18K is comparable to that of K-intercalated C-60 (ref. 4). This discovery of superconductivity in K(x)picene shows that organic hydrocarbons are promising candidates for improved T-c values."], ["Digoxin and its derivatives suppress T<sub>H</sub>17 cell differentiation by antagonizing ROR\u03b3t activity", "CD4(+) T helper lymphocytes that express interleukin-17 (T(H)17 cells) have critical roles in mouse models of autoimmunity, and there is mounting evidence that they also influence inflammatory processes in humans. Genome-wide association studies in humans have linked genes involved in T(H)17 cell differentiation and function with susceptibility to Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis(1-3). Thus, the pathway towards differentiation of T(H)17 cells and, perhaps, of related innate lymphoid cells with similar effector functions(4,5), is an attractive target for therapeutic applications. Mouse and human T(H)17 cells are distinguished by expression of the retinoic acid receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor ROR gamma t, which is required for induction of IL-17 transcription and for the manifestation of T(H)17-dependent autoimmune disease in mice(6). By performing a chemical screen with an insect cell-based reporter system, we identified the cardiac glycoside digoxin as a specific inhibitor of ROR gamma t transcriptional activity. Digoxin inhibited murine T(H)17 cell differentiation without affecting differentiation of other T cell lineages and was effective in delaying the onset and reducing the severity of autoimmune disease in mice. At high concentrations, digoxin is toxic for human cells, but non-toxic synthetic derivatives 20,22-dihydrodigoxin-21,23-diol and digoxin-21-salicylidene specifically inhibited induction of IL-17 in human CD4(+) T cells. Using these small-molecule compounds, we demonstrate that ROR gamma t is important for the maintenance of IL-17 expression in mouse and human effector T cells. These data indicate that derivatives of digoxin can be used as chemical templates for the development of ROR gamma t-targeted therapeutic agents that attenuate inflammatory lymphocyte function and autoimmune disease."], ["A microbial supply chain for production of the anti-cancer drug vinblastine", "Monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs) are a diverse family of complex plant secondary metabolites with many medicinal properties, including the essential anti-cancer therapeutics vinblastine and vincristine(1). As MIAs are difficult to chemically synthesize, the world's supply chain for vinblastine relies on low-yielding extraction and purification of the precursors vindoline and catharanthine from the plant Catharanthus roseus, which is then followed by simple in vitro chemical coupling and reduction to form vinblastine at an industrial scale(2,3). Here, we demonstrate the de novo microbial biosynthesis of vindoline and catharanthine using a highly engineered yeast, and in vitro chemical coupling to vinblastine. The study showcases a very long biosynthetic pathway refactored into a microbial cell factory, including 30 enzymatic steps beyond the yeast native metabolites geranyl pyrophosphate and tryptophan to catharanthine and vindoline. In total, 56 genetic edits were performed, including expression of 34 heterologous genes from plants, as well as deletions, knock-downs and overexpression of ten yeast genes to improve precursor supplies towards de novo production of catharanthine and vindoline, from which semisynthesis to vinblastine occurs. As the vinblastine pathway is one of the longest MIA biosynthetic pathways, this study positions yeast as a scalable platform to produce more than 3,000 natural MIAs and a virtually infinite number of new-to-nature analogues."], ["PAAR-repeat proteins sharpen and diversify the type VI secretion system spike", "The bacterial type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a large multicomponent, dynamic macromolecular machine that has an important role in the ecology of many Gram-negative bacteria. T6SS is responsible for translocation of a wide range of toxic effector molecules, allowing predatory cells to kill both prokaryotic as well as eukaryotic prey cells(1-5). The T6SS organelle is functionally analogous to contractile tails of bacteriophages and is thought to attack cells by initially penetrating them with a trimeric protein complex called the VgrG spike(6,7). Neither the exact protein composition of the T6SS organelle nor the mechanisms of effector selection and delivery are known. Here we report that proteins from the PAAR (proline-alanine-alanine-arginine) repeat superfamily form a sharp conical extension on the VgrG spike, which is further involved in attaching effector domains to the spike. The crystal structures of two PAAR-repeat proteins bound to VgrG-like partners show that these proteins sharpen the tip of the T6SS spike complex. We demonstrate that PAAR proteins are essential for T6SS-mediated secretion and target cell killing by Vibrio cholerae and Acinetobacter baylyi. Our results indicate a new model of the T6SS organelle in which the VgrG-PAAR spike complex is decorated with multiple effectors that are delivered simultaneously into target cells in a single contraction-driven translocation event."], ["Formation of tough interlocking microstructures in silicon nitride ceramics by dynamic ripening", "Ceramics based on Si3N4 have been comprehensively studied and are widely used in structural applications(1,2). The development of an interlocking microstructure of elongated grains is vital to ensure that this family of ceramics have good damage tolerance(3,4). Until now this has been accomplished by heating the appropriate powder compacts to temperatures above 1,700 degreesC for extended periods. This procedure involves a necessary step of controlling the size and population of seeds-added ex situ or formed in situ-to ensure selective grain growth(5,6). Here we report the very fast (within minutes) in situ formation of a tough interlocking microstructure in Si3N4-based ceramics. The microstructures are obtained by a dynamic ripening mechanism, an anisotropic Ostwald ripening process that results from the rapid heating rate. The resulting microstructures are uniform and reproducible in terms of grain size distribution and mechanical properties, and are easily tailored by manipulating the kinetics. This process is very efficient and opens up new possibilities to optimize mechanical properties and cost-effectively manufacture ceramics."], ["Jamming by shear", "A broad class of disordered materials including foams, glassy molecular systems, colloids and granular materials can form jammed states. A jammed system can resist small stresses without deforming irreversibly, whereas unjammed systems flow under any applied stresses. The broad applicability of the Liu-Nagel jamming concept(1,2) has attracted intensive theoretical and modelling interest but has prompted less experimental effort(1-6). In the Liu-Nagel framework, jammed states of athermal systems exist only above a certain critical density. Although numerical simulations for particles that do not experience friction broadly support this idea(7-13), the nature of the jamming transition for frictional grains is less clear(14-17). Here we show that jamming of frictional, disk-shaped grains can be induced by the application of shear stress at densities lower than the critical value, at which isotropic (shear-free) jamming occurs. These jammed states have a much richer phenomenology than the isotropic jammed states: for small applied shear stresses, the states are fragile, with a strong force network that percolates only in one direction. A minimum shear stress is needed to create robust, shear-jammed states with a strong force network percolating in all directions. The transitions from unjammed to fragile states and from fragile to shear-jammed states are controlled by the fraction of force-bearing grains. The fractions at which these transitions occur are statistically independent of the density. Jammed states with densities lower than the critical value have an anisotropic fabric (contact network). The minimum anisotropy of shear-jammed states vanishes as the density approaches the critical value from below, in a manner reminiscent of an order-disorder transition."], ["Catalytic C\u2013H functionalization by metal carbenoid and nitrenoid insertion", "Novel reactions that can selectively functionalize carbon\u2013hydrogen bonds are of intense interest to the chemical community because they offer new strategic approaches for synthesis. A very promising \u2018carbon\u2013hydrogen functionalization\u2019 method involves the insertion of metal carbenes and nitrenes into C\u2013H bonds. This area has experienced considerable growth in the past decade, particularly in the area of enantioselective intermolecular reactions. Here we discuss several facets of these kinds of C\u2013H functionalization reactions and provide a perspective on how this methodology has affected the synthesis of complex natural products and potential pharmaceutical agents."], ["Metastability of diamond ramp-compressed to 2 terapascals", "Carbon is the fourth-most prevalent element in the Universe and essential for all known life. In the elemental form it is found in multiple allotropes, including graphite, diamond and fullerenes, and it has long been predicted that even more structures can exist at pressures greater than those at Earth's core(1-3). Several phases have been predicted to exist in the multi-terapascal regime, which is important for accurate modelling of the interiors of carbon-rich exoplanets(4,5.) By compressing solid carbon to 2 terapascals (20 million atmospheres; more than five times the pressure at Earth's core) using ramp-shaped laser pulses and simultaneously measuring nanosecond-duration time-resolved X-ray diffraction, we found that solid carbon retains the diamond structure far beyond its regime of predicted stability. The results confirm predictions that the strength of the tetrahedral molecular orbital bonds in diamond persists under enormous pressure, resulting in large energy barriers that hinder conversion to more-stable high-pressure allotropes(1,2), just as graphite formation from metastable diamond is kinetically hindered at atmospheric pressure. This work nearly doubles the highest pressure at which X-ray diffraction has been recorded on any material."], ["Molecular mechanistic origin of the toughness of natural adhesives, fibres and composites", "Natural materials are renowned for their strength and toughness(1-5). Spider dragline silk has a breakage energy per unit weight two orders of magnitude greater than high tensile steel(1,6), and is representative of many other strong natural fibres(3,7,8). The abalone shell, a composite of calcium carbonate plates sandwiched between organic material, is 3,000 times more fracture resistant than a single crystal of the pure mineral(4,5). The organic component, comprising just a few per cent of the composite by weight(9), is thought to hold the key to nacre's fracture toughness(10,11). Ceramics laminated with organic material are more fracture resistant than non-laminated ceramics(11,12), but synthetic materials made of interlocking ceramic tablets bound by a few weight per cent of ordinary adhesives do not have a toughness comparable to nacre(13). We believe that the key to nacre's fracture resistance resides in the polymer adhesive, and here we reveal the properties of this adhesive by using the atomic force microscope(14) to stretch the organic molecules exposed on the surface of freshly cleaved nacre. The adhesive fibres elongate in a stepwise manner as folded domains or loops are pulled open. The elongation events occur for forces of a few hundred piconewtons, which are smaller than the forces of over a nanonewton required to break the polymer backbone in the threads. We suggest that this 'modular' elongation mechanism might prove to be quite general for conveying toughness to natural fibres and adhesives, and we predict that it might be found also in dragline silk."], ["Mediterranean winter rainfall in phase with African monsoons during the past 1.36 million years", "Mediterranean climates are characterized by strong seasonal contrasts between dry summers and wet winters. Changes in winter rainfall are critical for regional socioeconomic development, but are difficult to simulate accurately(1) and reconstruct on Quaternary timescales. This is partly because regional hydroclimate records that cover multiple glacial-interglacial cycles(2,3) with different orbital geometries, global ice volume and atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations are scarce. Moreover, the underlying mechanisms of change and their persistence remain unexplored. Here we show that, over the past 1.36 million years, wet winters in the northcentral Mediterranean tend to occur with high contrasts in local, seasonal insolation and a vigorous African summer monsoon. Our proxy time series from Lake Ohrid on the Balkan Peninsula, together with a 784,000-year transient climate model hindcast, suggest that increased sea surface temperatures amplify local cyclone development and refuel North Atlantic low-pressure systems that enter the Mediterranean during phases of low continental ice volume and high concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases. A comparison with modern reanalysis data shows that current drivers of the amount of rainfall in the Mediterranean share some similarities to those that drive the reconstructed increases in precipitation. Our data cover multiple insolation maxima and are therefore an important benchmark for testing climate model performance."], ["Designing the next generation of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells", "With the rapid growth and development of proton-exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) technology, there has been increasing demand for clean and sustainable global energy applications. Of the many device-level and infrastructure challenges that need to be overcome before wide commercialization can be realized, one of the most critical ones is increasing the PEMFC power density, and ambitious goals have been proposed globally. For example, the short- and long-term power density goals of Japan's New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization are 6 kilowatts per litre by 2030 and 9 kilowatts per litre by 2040, respectively. To this end, here we propose technical development directions for next-generation high-power-density PEMFCs. We present the latest ideas for improvements in the membrane electrode assembly and its components with regard to water and thermal management and materials. These concepts are expected to be implemented in next-generation PEMFCs to achieve high power density.

This is possible if the material is phosphorescent, and high efficiencies have been observed in phosphorescent(1,2) organic light-emitting devices(3), However, phosphorescence in organic molecules is rare at room temperature. The alternative radiative process of fluorescence is more common, but it is approximately 75% less efficient, due to the requirement of spin-symmetry conservation(4) Here, we demonstrate that this deficiency can be overcome by using a phosphorescent sensitizer to excite a fluorescent dye. The mechanism for energetic coupling between phosphorescent and fluorescent molecular species is a long-range, non-radiative energy transfer: the internal efficiency of fluorescence can be as high as 100%. As an example, we use this approach to nearly quadruple the efficiency of a fluorescent red organic light-emitting device."], ["eIF3 targets cell-proliferation messenger RNAs for translational activation or repression", "Regulation of protein synthesis is fundamental for all aspects of eukaryotic biology by controlling development, homeostasis and stress responses(1,2). The 13-subunit, 800-kilodalton eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) organizes initiation factor and ribosome interactions required for productive translation(3). However, current understanding of eIF3 function does not explain genetic evidence correlating eIF3 deregulation with tissue-specific cancers and developmental defects(4). Here we report the genome-wide discovery of human transcripts that interact with eIF3 using photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP)(5). eIF3 binds to a highly specific program of messenger RNAs involved in cell growth control processes, including cell cycling, differentiation and apoptosis, via them RNA 5' untranslated region. Surprisingly, functional analysis of the interaction between eIF3 and two mRNAs encoding the cell proliferation regulators c-JUN and BTG1 reveals that eIF3 uses different modes of RNA stem-loop binding to exert either translational activation or repression. Our findings illuminate a new role for eIF3 in governing a specialized repertoire of gene expression and suggest that binding of eIF3 to specific mRNAs could be targeted to control carcinogenesis."], ["Two-Dimensional Organic\u2013Inorganic Perovskite Ferroelectric Semiconductors with Fluorinated Aromatic Spacers", "Two-dimensional (2D) organic\u2013inorganic perovskites (OIPs), with improved material stability over their 3D counterparts, are highly desirable for device applications. It is their considerable structural diversity that offers an unprecedented opportunity to engineer materials with fine-tuning functionalities. The isosteric substitution of hydrogen by an electronegative fluorine atom has been proposed as a useful route to improve the photovoltaic performance of 2D OIPs, whereas its valuable role in developing ferroelectricity is still waiting for further exploration. Herein, for the first time we applied fluorinated aromatic cations in extending the family of 2D OIP ferroelectrics, and successfully obtained [2-fluorobenzylammonium]2PbCl4 as a high-performance ferroelectric semiconductor. The failures in the nonferroelectric [4-fluorobenzylammonium]2PbCl4 and [3-fluorobenzylammonium]2PbCl4 demonstrate that the selective introduction of fluorine in correct structural positions is particularly essential. This work represents an unprecedented proof-of-concept in the use of fluorinated aromatic cations for the targeted design of excellent 2D OIP ferroelectrics, and is believed to inspire the future development of low-cost, high-efficiency, and stable device applications."], ["The earliest bird-line archosaurs and the assembly of the dinosaur body plan", "The relationship between dinosaurs and other reptiles is well established(1-4), but the sequence of acquisition of dinosaurian features has been obscured by the scarcity of fossils with transitional morphologies. The closest extinct relatives of dinosaurs either have highly derived morphologies(5-7) or are known from poorly preserved(8,9) or incomplete material(10,11). Here we describe one of the stratigraphically lowest and phylogenetically earliest members of the avian stem lineage (Avemetatarsalia), Teleocrater rhadinus gen. et sp. nov., from the Middle Triassic epoch. The anatomy of T. rhadinus provides key information that unites several enigmatic taxa from across Pangaea into a previously unrecognized clade, Aphanosauria. This clade is the sister taxon of Ornithodira (pterosaurs and birds) and shortens the ghost lineage inferred at the base of Avemetatarsalia. We demonstrate that several anatomical features long thought to characterize Dinosauria and dinosauriforms evolved much earlier, soon after the bird-crocodylian split, and that the earliest avemetatarsalians retained the crocodylian-like ankle morphology and hindlimb proportions of stem archosaurs and early pseudosuchians. Early avemetatarsalians were substantially more species-rich, widely geographically distributed and morphologically diverse than previously recognized. Moreover, several early dinosauromorphs that were previously used as models to understand dinosaur origins may represent specialized forms rather than the ancestral avemetatarsalian morphology."], ["A dearth of intermediate melts at subduction zone volcanoes and the petrogenesis of arc andesites", "Andesites represent a large proportion of the magmas erupted at continental arc volcanoes and are regarded as a major component in the formation of continental crust(1). Andesite petrogenesis is therefore fundamental in terms of both volcanic hazard and differentiation of the Earth. Andesites typically contain a significant proportion of crystals showing disequilibrium petrographic characteristics indicative of mixing or mingling between silicic and mafic magmas, which fuels a long-standing debate regarding the significance of these processes in andesite petrogenesis(2) and ultimately questions the abundance of true liquids with andesitic composition. Central to this debate is the distinction between liquids (or melts) and magmas, mixtures of liquids with crystals, which may or may not be co-genetic. With this distinction comes the realization that bulk-rock chemical analyses of petrologically complex andesites can lead to a blurred picture of the fundamental processes behind arc magmatism. Here we present an alternative view of andesite petrogenesis, based on a review of quenched glassy melt inclusions trapped in phenocrysts, whole-rock chemistry, and high-pressure and high-temperature experiments. We argue that true liquids of intermediate composition (59 to 66 wt% SiO2) are far less common in the sub-volcanic reservoirs of arc volcanoes than is suggested by the abundance of erupted magma within this compositional range. Effective mingling within upper crustal magmatic reservoirs obscures a compositional bimodality of melts ascending from the lower crust, and masks the fundamental role of silicic melts (>= 66 wt% SiO2) beneath intermediate arc volcanoes. This alternative view resolves several puzzling aspects of arc volcanism and provides important clues to the integration of plutonic and volcanic records."], ["Immune self-reactivity triggered by drug-modified HLA-peptide repertoire", "Human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) are highly polymorphic proteins that initiate immunity by presenting pathogen-derived peptides to T cells(1). HLA polymorphisms mostly map to the antigen-binding cleft, thereby diversifying the repertoire of self-derived and pathogen-derived peptide antigens selected by different HLA allotypes(2). A growing number of immunologically based drug reactions, including abacavir hypersensitivity syndrome (AHS) and carbamazepine-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), are associated with specific HLA alleles(3-7). However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of these associations, including AHS, a prototypical HLA-associated drug reaction occurring exclusively in individuals with the common histocompatibility allele HLA-B*57:01, and with a relative risk of more than 1,000 (refs 6, 7). We show that unmodified abacavir binds non-covalently to HLA-B*57:01, lying across the bottom of the antigen-binding cleft and reaching into the F-pocket, where a carboxy-terminal tryptophan typically anchors peptides bound to HLA-B*57:01. Abacavir binds with exquisite specificity to HLA-B*57:01, changing the shape and chemistry of the antigen-binding cleft, thereby altering the repertoire of endogenous peptides that can bind HLA-B*57:01. In this way, abacavir guides the selection of new endogenous peptides, inducing a marked alteration in 'immunological self'. The resultant peptide-centric 'altered self' activates abacavir-specific T-cells, thereby driving polyclonal CD8 T-cell activation and a systemic reaction manifesting as AHS. We also show that carbamazepine, a widely used anti-epileptic drug associated with hypersensitivity reactions in HLA-B*15:02 individuals, binds to this allotype, producing alterations in the repertoire of presented self peptides.

Here we show that light-controlled transcription can be used to enhance the biosynthesis of valuable products in engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We introduce new optogenetic circuits to shift cells from a light-induced growth phase to a darkness-induced production phase, which allows us to control fermentation with only light. Furthermore, optogenetic control of engineered pathways enables a new mode of bioreactor operation using periodic light pulses to tune enzyme expression during the production phase of fermentation to increase yields. Using these advances, we control the mitochondrial isobutanol pathway to produce up to 8.49 +/- 0.31 g l(-1) of isobutanol and 2.38 +/- 0.06 g l(-1) of 2-methyl-1-butanol micro-aerobically from glucose. These results make a compelling case for the application of optogenetics to metabolic engineering for the production of valuable products."], ["Collisions between cold molecules in a superconducting magnetic trap", "Collisions between cold molecules are essential for studying fundamental aspects of quantum chemistry, and may enable the formation of quantum degenerate molecular matter by evaporative cooling. However, collisions between trapped, naturally occurring molecules have not been directly observed so far owing to the low collision rates of dilute samples. Here we report the direct observation of collisions between cold trapped molecules, without the need for laser cooling. We magnetically capture molecular oxygen in an 800-millikelvin-deep superconducting trap and set bounds on the ratio between the elastic- and inelastic-scattering rates-the key parameter determining the feasibility of evaporative cooling. We further co-trap atoms and molecules and identify collisions between them, paving the way for studies of cold interspecies collisions in a magnetic trap."], ["Designing switchable polarization and magnetization at room temperature in an oxide", "Ferroelectric and ferromagnetic materials exhibit long-range order of atomic-scale electric or magnetic dipoles that can be switched by applying an appropriate electric or magnetic field, respectively. Both switching phenomena form the basis of non-volatile random access memory(1), but in the ferroelectric case, this involves destructive electrical reading and in the magnetic case, a high writing energy is required(2). In principle, low-power and high-density information storage that combines fast electrical writing and magnetic reading can be realized with magnetoelectric multiferroic materials(3). These materials not only simultaneously display ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism, but also enable magnetic moments to be induced by an external electric field, or electric polarization by a magnetic field(4,5). However, synthesizing bulk materials with both long-range orders at room temperature in a single crystalline structure is challenging because conventional ferroelectricity requires closed-shell d(0) or s(2) cations, whereas ferromagnetic order requires open-shell d(n) configurations with unpaired electrons(6). These opposing requirements pose considerable difficulties for atomic-scale design strategies such as magnetic ion substitution into ferroelectrics(7,8). One material that exhibits both ferroelectric and magnetic order is BiFeO3, but its cycloidal magnetic structure(9) precludes bulk magnetization and linear magnetoelectric coupling(10). A solid solution of a ferroelectric and a spin-glass perovskite combines switchable polarization(11) with glassy magnetization, although it lacks long-range magnetic order(12). Crystal engineering of a layered perovskite has recently resulted in room-temperature polar ferromagnets(13), but the electrical polarization has not been switchable. Here we combine ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism at room temperature in a bulk perovskite oxide, by constructing a percolating network of magnetic ions with strong superexchange interactions within a structural scaffold exhibiting polar lattice symmetries at a morphotropic phase boundary(14) (the compositional boundary between two polar phases with different polarization directions, exemplified by the PbZrO3-PbTiO3 system) that both enhances polarization switching and permits canting of the ordered magnetic moments. We expect this strategy to allow the generation of a range of tunable multiferroic materials."], ["Photoredox catalysis with aryl sulfonium salts enables site-selective late-stage fluorination", "Photoredox catalysis, especially in combination with transition metal catalysis, can produce redox states of transition metal catalysts to facilitate challenging bond formations that are not readily accessible in conventional redox catalysis. For arene functionalization, metallophotoredox catalysis has successfully made use of the same leaving groups as those valuable in conventional cross-coupling catalysis, such as bromide. Yet the redox potentials of common photoredox catalysts are not sufficient to reduce most aryl bromides, so synthetically useful aryl radicals are often not directly available. Therefore, the development of a distinct leaving group more appropriately matched in redox potential could enable new reactivity manifolds for metallophotoredox catalysis, especially if arylcopper(III) complexes are accessible, from which the most challenging bond-forming reactions can occur. Here we show the conceptual advantages of aryl thianthrenium salts for metallophotoredox catalysis, and their utility in site-selective late-stage aromatic fluorination."], ["A Pax3/Pax7-dependent population of skeletal muscle progenitor cells", "During vertebrate development, successive phases of embryonic and fetal myogenesis lead to the formation and growth of skeletal muscles(1). Although the origin and molecular regulation of the earliest embryonic muscle cells is well understood(2), less is known about later stages of myogenesis. We have identified a new cell population that expresses the transcription factors Pax3 and Pax7 (paired box proteins 3 and 7) but no skeletal-muscle-specific markers. These cells are maintained as a proliferating population in embryonic and fetal muscles of the trunk and limbs throughout development. Using a stable green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter targeted to Pax3, we demonstrate that they constitute resident muscle progenitor cells that subsequently become myogenic and form skeletal muscle. Late in fetal development, these cells adopt a satellite cell position characteristic of progenitor cells in postnatal muscle. In the absence of both Pax3 and Pax7, further muscle development is arrested and only the early embryonic muscle of the myotome forms. Cells failing to express Pax3 or Pax7 die or assume a non-myogenic fate. We conclude that this resident Pax3/Pax7-dependent progenitor cell population constitutes a source of myogenic cells of prime importance for skeletal muscle formation, a finding also of potential value in the context of cell therapy for muscle disease."], ["Atomically engineered ferroic layers yield a room - temperature magnetoelectric multiferroic", "Materials that exhibit simultaneous order in their electric and magnetic ground states hold promise for use in next-generation memory devices in which electric fields control magnetism(1,2). Such materials are exceedingly rare, however, owing to competing requirements for displacive ferroelectricity and magnetism(3). Despite the recent identification of several new multiferroic materials and magnetoelectric coupling mechanisms(4-15), known single-phase multiferroics remain limited by antiferromagnetic or weak ferromagnetic alignments, by a lack of coupling between the order parameters, or by having properties that emerge only well below room temperature, precluding device applications(2). Here we present a methodology for constructing single-phase multiferroic materials in which ferroelectricity and strong magnetic ordering are coupled near room temperature. Starting with hexagonal LuFeO3-the geometric ferroelectric with the greatest known planar rumpling(16)-we introduce individual monolayers of FeO during growth to construct formula-unit-thick syntactic layers of ferrimagnetic LuFe2O4 (refs 17, 18) within the LuFeO3 matrix, that is, (LuFeO3)(m)/(LuFe2O4)(1) superlattices. The severe rumpling imposed by the neighbouring LuFeO3 drives the ferrimagnetic LuFe2O4 into a simultaneously ferroelectric state, while also reducing the LuFe2O4 spin frustration. This increases the magnetic transition temperature substantially-from 240 kelvin for LuFe2O4 (ref. 18) to 281 kelvin for (LuFeO3)(9)/(LuFe2O4)(1). Moreover, the ferroelectric order couples to the ferrimagnetism, enabling direct electric-field control of magnetism at 200 kelvin. Our results demonstrate a design methodology for creating higher-temperature magnetoelectric multiferroics by exploiting a combination of geometric frustration, lattice distortions and epitaxial engineering."], ["Synthesis and properties of a bio-based epoxy resin from 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA)", "A bio-based epoxy monomer, diglycidyl ester of 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (DGF) was synthesized for the first time from the renewable 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). For comparison study, its petroleum-based counterpart, diglycidyl ester of terephthalic acid (DGT) was also prepared. Their chemical structures were confirmed in detail by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and FT-IR before they were cured by methylhexahydrophthalic anhydride (MHHPA) and poly(propylene glycol)bis(2-aminopropyl ether) (D230), respectively. The curing behaviors were investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The thermal mechanical properties and thermal stabilities of the cured resins were evaluated using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Results showed that DGF displayed higher curing activity, elevated glass transition temperature and similar mechanical properties compared with those of the cured DGT. This study indicated that FDCA had a huge potential to replace the petroleum-based terephthalic acid in the synthesis of epoxy resins with satisfactory performance."], ["Holistic prediction of enantioselectivity in asymmetric catalysis", "When faced with unfamiliar reaction space, synthetic chemists typically apply the reported conditions (reagents, catalyst, solvent and additives) of a successful reaction to a desired, closely related reaction using a new substrate type. Unfortunately, this approach often fails owing to subtle differences in reaction requirements. Consequently, an important goal in synthetic chemistry is the ability to transfer chemical observations quantitatively from one reaction to another. Here we present a holistic, data-driven workflow for deriving statistical models of one set of reactions that can be used to predict out-of-sample reactions. As a validating case study, we combined published enantioselectivity datasets that employ 1,1'-bi-2-naphthol (BINOL)-derived chiral phosphoric acids for a range of nucleophilic addition reactions to imines and developed statistical models. These models reveal the general interactions that impart asymmetric induction and allow the quantitative transfer of this information to new reaction components. This technique creates opportunities for translating comprehensive reaction analysis to diverse chemical space, streamlining both catalyst and reaction development."], ["Oil sands operations as a large source of secondary organic aerosols", "Worldwide heavy oil and bitumen deposits amount to 9 trillion barrels of oil distributed in over 280 basins around the world(1), with Canada home to oil sands deposits of 1.7 trillion barrels(2). The global development of this resource and the increase in oil production from oil sands has caused environmental concerns over the presence of toxic compounds in nearby ecosystems(3,4) and acid deposition(5,6). The contribution of oil sands exploration to secondary organic aerosol formation, an important component of atmospheric particulate matter that affects air quality and climate(7), remains poorly understood. Here we use data from airborne measurements over the Canadian oil sands, laboratory experiments and a box-model study to provide a quantitative assessment of the magnitude of secondary organic aerosol production from oil sands emissions. We find that the evaporation and atmospheric oxidation of low-volatility organic vapours from the mined oil sands material is directly responsible for the majority of the observed secondary organic aerosol mass. The resultant production rates of 45-84 tonnes per day make the oil sands one of the largest sources of anthropogenic secondary organic aerosols in North America. Heavy oil and bitumen account for over ten per cent of global oil production today(8), and this figure continues to grow(9). Our findings suggest that the production of the more viscous crude oils could be a large source of secondary organic aerosols in many production and refining regions worldwide, and that such production should be considered when assessing the environmental impacts of current and planned bitumen and heavy oil extraction projects globally."], ["Teixobactin kills bacteria by a two-pronged attack on the cell envelope", "Antibiotics that use novel mechanisms are needed to combat antimicrobial resistance(1-3). Teixobactin(4) represents a new class of antibiotics with a unique chemical scaffold and lack of detectable resistance. Teixobactin targets lipid II, a precursor of peptidoglycan(5). Here we unravel the mechanism of teixobactin at the atomic level using a combination of solid-state NMR, microscopy, in vivo assays and molecular dynamics simulations. The unique enduracididine C-terminal headgroup of teixobactin specifically binds to the pyrophosphate-sugar moiety of lipid II, whereas the N terminus coordinates the pyrophosphate of another lipid II molecule. This configuration favours the formation of a beta-sheet of teixobactins bound to the target, creating a supramolecular fibrillar structure. Specific binding to the conserved pyrophosphate-sugar moiety accounts for the lack of resistance to teixobactin(4). The supramolecular structure compromises membrane integrity. Atomic force microscopy and molecular dynamics simulations show that the supramolecular structure displaces phospholipids, thinning the membrane. The long hydrophobic tails of lipid II concentrated within the supramolecular structure apparently contribute to membrane disruption. Teixobactin hijacks lipid II to help destroy the membrane. Known membrane-acting antibiotics also damage human cells, producing undesirable side effects. Teixobactin damages only membranes that contain lipid II, which is absent in eukaryotes, elegantly resolving the toxicity problem. The two-pronged action against cell wall synthesis and cytoplasmic membrane produces a highly effective compound targeting the bacterial cell envelope. Structural knowledge of the mechanism of teixobactin will enable the rational design of improved drug candidates."], ["Sodium salts in E-ring ice grains from an ocean below the surface of Enceladus", "Saturn's moon Enceladus emits plumes of water vapour and ice particles from fractures near its south pole(1-5), suggesting the possibility of a subsurface ocean(5-7). These plume particles are the dominant source of Saturn's E ring(7,8). A previous in situ analysis(9) of these particles concluded that the minor organic or siliceous components, identified in many ice grains, could be evidence for interaction between Enceladus' rocky core and liquid water(9,10). It was not clear, however, whether the liquid is still present today or whether it has frozen. Here we report the identification of a population of E-ring grains that are rich in sodium salts (similar to 0.5-2% by mass), which can arise only if the plumes originate from liquid water. The abundance of various salt components in these particles, as well as the inferred basic pH, exhibit a compelling similarity to the predicted composition of a subsurface Enceladus ocean in contact with its rock core(11). The plume vapour is expected to be free of atomic sodium. Thus, the absence of sodium from optical spectra(12) is in good agreement with our results. In the E ring the upper limit for spectroscopy(12) is insufficiently sensitive to detect the concentrations we found."], ["Metabolic support of tumour-infiltrating regulatory T cells by lactic acid", "Regulatory T (T-reg) cells, although vital for immune homeostasis, also represent a major barrier to anti-cancer immunity, as the tumour microenvironment (TME) promotes the recruitment, differentiation and activity of these cells(1,2). Tumour cells show deregulated metabolism, leading to a metabolite-depleted, hypoxic and acidic TME3, which places infiltrating effector T cells in competition with the tumour for metabolites and impairs their function(4-6). At the same time, T-reg cells maintain a strong suppression of effector T cells within the TME7,8. As previous studies suggested that T-reg cells possess a distinct metabolic profile from effector T cells(9-11), we hypothesized that the altered metabolic landscape of the TME and increased activity of intratumoral T-reg cells are linked. Here we show that T-reg cells display broad heterogeneity in their metabolism of glucose within normal and transformed tissues, and can engage an alternative metabolic pathway to maintain suppressive function and proliferation. Glucose uptake correlates with poorer suppressive function and long-term instability, and high-glucose conditions impair the function and stability of T-reg cells in vitro. T-reg cells instead upregulate pathways involved in the metabolism of the glycolytic by-product lactic acid. T-reg cells withstand high-lactate conditions, and treatment with lactate prevents the destabilizing effects of high-glucose conditions, generating intermediates necessary for proliferation. Deletion of MCT1-a lactate transporter-in T-reg cells reveals that lactate uptake is dispensable for the function of peripheral T-reg cells but required intratumorally, resulting in slowed tumour growth and an increased response to immunotherapy. Thus, T-reg cells are metabolically flexible: they can use 'alternative' metabolites in the TME to maintain their suppressive identity. Further, our results suggest that tumours avoid destruction by not only depriving effector T cells of nutrients, but also metabolically supporting regulatory populations."], ["Quantum simulation of frustrated Ising spins with trapped ions", "A network is frustrated when competing interactions between nodes prevent each bond from being satisfied. This compromise is central to the behaviour of many complex systems, from social(1) and neural(2) networks to protein folding(3) and magnetism(4,5). Frustrated networks have highly degenerate ground states, with excess entropy and disorder even at zero temperature. In the case of quantum networks, frustration can lead to massively entangled ground states, underpinning exotic materials such as quantum spin liquids and spin glasses(6-9). Here we realize a quantum simulation of frustrated Ising spins in a system of three trapped atomic ions(10-12), whose interactions are precisely controlled using optical forces(13). We study the ground state of this system as it adiabatically evolves from a transverse polarized state, and observe that frustration induces extra degeneracy. We also measure the entanglement in the system, finding a link between frustration and ground-state entanglement. This experimental system can be scaled to simulate larger numbers of spins, the ground states of which (for frustrated interactions) cannot be simulated on a classical computer."], ["FEMTOSECOND MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS OF TAUTOMERIZATION IN MODEL BASE-PAIRS", "Hydrogen bonds commonly lend robustness and directionality to molecular recognition processes and supramolecular structures(1,2). In particular, the two or three hydrogen bonds in Watson-Crick base pairs bind the double-stranded DNA helix and determine the complementarity of the pairing. Watson and Crick pointed out(3), however, that the possible tautomers of base pairs, in which hydrogen atoms become attached to the donor atom of the hydrogen bond, might disturb the genetic code, as the tautomer is capable of pairing with different partners. But the dynamics of hydrogen bonds in general, and of this tautomerization process in particular, are not well understood. Here we report observations of the femtosecond dynamics of tautomerization in model base pairs (7-azaindole dimers) containing two hydrogen bonds. Because of the femtosecond resolution of proton motions, we are able to examine the cooperativity of formation of the tautomer (in which the protons on each base are shifted sequentially to the other base), and to determine the characteristic timescales of the motions in a solvent-free environment. We find that the first step occurs on a timescale of a few hundred femtoseconds, whereas the second step, to form the full tautomer, is much slower, taking place within several picoseconds; the timescales are changed significantly by replacing hydrogen with deuterium. These results establish the molecular basis of the dynamics and the role of quantum tunnelling."], ["Structural identification of a bacterial quorum-sensing signal containing boron", "Cell-cell communication in bacteria is accomplished through the exchange of extracellular signalling molecules called autoinducers. This process, termed quorum sensing, allows bacterial populations to coordinate gene expression. Community cooperation probably enhances the effectiveness of processes such as bioluminescence, virulence factor expression, antibiotic production and biofilm development(1-4). Unlike other autoinducers, which are specific to a particular species of bacteria, a recently discovered autoinducer (AI-2)(5) is produced by a large number of bacterial species. AI-2 has been proposed to serve as a 'universal' signal for inter-species communication(1,2,6,7). The chemical identity of AI-2 has, however, proved elusive. Here we present the crystal structure of an AI-2 sensor protein, LuxP, in a complex with autoinducer. The bound ligand is a furanosyl borate diester that bears no resemblance to previously characterized autoinducers. Our findings suggest that addition of naturally occurring borate to an AI-2 precursor generates active AI-2. Furthermore, they indicate a potential biological role for boron, an element required by a number of organisms but for unknown reasons."], ["Flat-surface-assisted and self-regulated oxidation resistance of Cu(111)", "Oxidation can deteriorate the properties of copper that are critical for its use, particularly in the semiconductor industry and electro-optics applications(1-7). This has prompted numerous studies exploring copper oxidation and possible passivation strategies(8). In situ observations have, for example, shown that oxidation involves stepped surfaces: Cu2O growth occurs on flat surfaces as a result of Cu adatoms detaching from steps and diffusing across terraces(9-11). But even though this mechanism explains why single-crystalline copper is more resistant to oxidation than polycrystalline copper, the fact that flat copper surfaces can be free of oxidation has not been explored further. Here we report the fabrication of copper thin films that are semi-permanently oxidation resistant because they consist of flat surfaces with only occasional mono-atomic steps. First-principles calculations confirm that mono-atomic step edges are as impervious to oxygen as flat surfaces and that surface adsorption of O atoms is suppressed once an oxygen face-centred cubic (fcc) surface site coverage of 50% has been reached. These combined effects explain the exceptional oxidation resistance of ultraflat Cu surfaces."], ["FUSED TRANSCRIPT OF ABL AND BCR GENES IN CHRONIC MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIA", "Human chronic myelogenous leukemia is characterized by a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 resulting in an abbreviated form of chromosome 22, and the transfer of the abl cellular oncogene from chromosome 9 into the bcr gene of chromosome 22. Characterization of an 8 kilobase RNA specific to chronic myelogenous leukemia shows it to be a fused transcript of the 2 genes. The fused protein that would be produced is probably involved in the malignant process."], ["Improving the performance of doped \u03c0-conjugated polymers for use in organic light-emitting diodes", "Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) represent a promising technology for large, flexible, lightweight, flat-panel displays(1-3). Such devices consist of one or several semiconducting organic layer(s) sandwiched between two electrodes. When an electric field is applied, electrons are injected by the cathode into the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of the adjacent molecules (simultaneously, holes are injected by the anode into the highest occupied molecular orbital). The two types of carriers migrate towards each other and a fraction of them recombine to form excitons, some of which decay radiatively to the ground state by spontaneous emission. Doped pi-conjugated polymer layers improve the injection of holes in OLED devices(4-9); this is thought to result from the more favourable work function of these injection layers compared with the more commonly used layer material (indium tin oxide). Here we demonstrate that by increasing the doping level of such polymers, the barrier to hole injection can be continuously reduced. The use of combinatorial devices allows us to quickly screen for the optimum doping level. We apply this concept in OLED devices with hole-limited electroluminescence (such as polyfluorene-based systems(10-12)), finding that it is possible to significantly reduce the operating voltage while improving the light output and efficiency."], ["Chemical intervention in plant sugar signalling increases yield and resilience", "The pressing global issue of food insecurity due to population growth, diminishing land and variable climate can only be addressed in agriculture by improving both maximum crop yield potential and resilience(1,2). Genetic modification is one potential solution, but has yet to achieve worldwide acceptance, particularly for crops such as wheat(3). Trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P), a central sugar signal in plants, regulates sucrose use and allocation, underpinning crop growth and development(4,5). Here we show that application of a chemical intervention strategy directly modulates T6P levels in planta. Plant-permeable analogues of T6P were designed and constructed based on a 'signalling-precursor' concept for permeability, ready uptake and sunlight-triggered release of T6P in planta. We show that chemical intervention in a potent sugar signal increases grain yield, whereas application to vegetative tissue improves recovery and resurrection from drought. This technology offers a means to combine increases in yield with crop stress resilience. Given the generality of the T6P pathway in plants and other small-molecule signals in biology, these studies suggest that suitable synthetic exogenous small-molecule signal precursors can be used to directly enhance plant performance and perhaps other organism function."], ["Observation of the nonlinear Hall effect under time-reversal-symmetric conditions", "The electrical Hall effect is the production, upon the application of an electric field, of a transverse voltage under an out-of-plane magnetic field. Studies of the Hall effect have led to important breakthroughs, including the discoveries of Berry curvature and topological Chern invariants(1,2). The internal magnetization of magnets means that the electrical Hall effect can occur in the absence of an external magnetic field(2); this 'anomalous' Hall effect is important for the study of quantum magnets(2-7). The electrical Hall effect has rarely been studied in non-magnetic materials without external magnetic fields, owing to the constraint of timer-eversal symmetry. However, only in the linear response regime-when the Hall voltage is linearly proportional to the external electric field-does the Hall effect identically vanish as a result of time-reversal symmetry; the Hall effect in the nonlinear response regime is not subject to such symmetry constraints(8-10). Here we report observations of the nonlinear Hall effect(10) in electrical transport in bilayers of the non-magnetic quantum material WTe2 under time-reversal-symmetric conditions. We show that an electric current in bilayer WTe2 leads to a nonlinear Hall voltage in the absence of a magnetic field. The properties of this nonlinear Hall effect are distinct from those of the anomalous Hall effect in metals: the nonlinear Hall effect results in a quadratic, rather than linear, current-voltage characteristic and, in contrast to the anomalous Hall effect, the nonlinear Hall effect results in a much larger transverse than longitudinal voltage response, leading to a nonlinear Hall angle (the angle between the total voltage response and the applied electric field) of nearly 90 degrees. We further show that the nonlinear Hall effect provides a direct measure of the dipole moment(10) of the Berry curvature, which arises from layer-polarized Dirac fermions in bilayer WTe2. Our results demonstrate a new type of Hall effect and provide a way of detecting Berry curvature in nonmagnetic quantum materials."], ["Synthesis, assembly and applications of semiconductor nanomembranes", "Research in electronic nanomaterials, historically dominated by studies of nanocrystals/fullerenes and nanowires/nanotubes, now incorporates a growing focus on sheets with nanoscale thicknesses, referred to as nanomembranes.

Recent advances in synthesis provide access to nanomembranes with extraordinary properties in a variety of configurations, some of which exploit quantum and other size-dependent effects. This progress, together with emerging methods for deterministic assembly, leads to compelling opportunities for research, from basic studies of two-dimensional physics to the development of applications of heterogeneous electronics."], ["Highly stretchable and tough hydrogels", "Hydrogels are used as scaffolds for tissue engineering1, vehicles for drug delivery2, actuators for optics and fluidics3, and model extracellular matrices for biological studies4. The scope of hydrogel applications, however, is often severely limited by their mechanical behaviour5. Most hydrogels do not exhibit high stretchability; for example, an alginate hydrogel ruptures when stretched to about 1.2 times its original length. Some synthetic elastic hydrogels6,7 have achieved stretches in the range 10\u201320, but these values are markedly reduced in samples containing notches. Most hydrogels are brittle, with fracture energies of about 10\u2009J\u2009m\u22122 (ref. 8), as compared with \u223c1,000\u2009J\u2009m\u22122 for cartilage9 and \u223c10,000\u2009J\u2009m\u22122 for natural rubbers10. Intense efforts are devoted to synthesizing hydrogels with improved mechanical properties; certain synthetic gels have reached fracture energies of 100\u20131,000\u2009J\u2009m\u22122. Here we report the synthesis of hydrogels from polymers forming ionically and covalently crosslinked networks. Although such gels contain \u223c90% water, they can be stretched beyond 20 times their initial length, and have fracture energies of \u223c9,000\u2009J\u2009m\u22122. Even for samples containing notches, a stretch of 17 is demonstrated. We attribute the gels\u2019 toughness to the synergy of two mechanisms: crack bridging by the network of covalent crosslinks, and hysteresis by unzipping the network of ionic crosslinks. Furthermore, the network of covalent crosslinks preserves the memory of the initial state, so that much of the large deformation is removed on unloading. The unzipped ionic crosslinks cause internal damage, which heals by re-zipping. These gels may serve as model systems to explore mechanisms of deformation and energy dissipation, and expand the scope of hydrogel applications."], ["Monolayer semiconductor nanocavity lasers with ultralow thresholds", "Engineering the electromagnetic environment of a nanometre-scale light emitter by use of a photonic cavity can significantly enhance its spontaneous emission rate, through cavity quantum electrodynamics in the Purcell regime. This effect can greatly reduce the lasing threshold of the emitter(1-5), providing a low-threshold laser system with small footprint, low power consumption and ultrafast modulation. An ultralow-threshold nanoscale laser has been successfully developed by embedding quantum dots into a photonic crystal cavity (PCC)(6-8). However, several challenges impede the practical application of this architecture, including the randompositions and compositional fluctuations of the dots(7), extreme difficulty in current injection(8), and lack of compatibility with electronic circuits(7,8). Here we report a new lasing strategy: an atomically thin crystalline semiconductor-that is, a tungsten diselenide monolayer-is non-destructively and deterministically introduced as a gain medium at the surface of a pre-fabricated PCC. A continuous-wave nanolaser operating in the visible regime is thereby achieved with an optical pumping threshold as low as 27 nanowatts at 130 kelvin, similar to the value achieved in quantum-dot PCC lasers(7). The key to the lasing action lies in the monolayer nature of the gain medium, which confines direct-gap excitons to within one nanometre of the PCC surface. The surface-gain geometry gives unprecedented accessibility and hence the ability to tailor gain properties via external controls such as electrostatic gating and current injection, enabling electrically pumped operation. Our scheme is scalable and compatible with integrated photonics for on-chip optical communication technologies."], ["Short-range order and its impact on the CrCoNi medium-entropy alloy", "Traditional metallic alloys are mixtures of elements in which the atoms of minority species tend to be distributed randomly if they are below their solubility limit, or to form secondary phases if they are above it. The concept of multiple-principal-element alloys has recently expanded this view, as these materials are single-phase solid solutions of generally equiatomic mixtures of metallic elements. This group of materials has received much interest owing to their enhanced mechanical properties. They are usually called medium-entropy alloys in ternary systems and high-entropy alloys in quaternary or quinary systems, alluding to their high degree of configurational entropy. However, the question has remained as to how random these solid solutions actually are, with the influence of short-range order being suggested in computational simulations but not seen experimentally6,7. Here we report the observation, using energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy, of structural features attributable to short-range order in the CrCoNi medium-entropy alloy. Increasing amounts of such order give rise to both higher stacking-fault energy and hardness. These findings suggest that the degree of local ordering at the nanometre scale can be tailored through thermomechanical processing, providing a new avenue for tuning the mechanical properties of medium- and high-entropy alloys."], ["Spin-orbit-driven band inversion in bilayer graphene by the van der Waals proximity effect", "Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is the key to realizing time-reversal-invariant topological phases of matter(1,2). SOC was predicted by Kane and Mele(3) to stabilize a quantum spin Hall insulator; however, the weak intrinsic SOC in monolayer graphene(4-7) has precluded experimental observation in this material. Here we exploit a layer-selective proximity effect-achieved via a van der Waals contact with a semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenide(8-21)-to engineer Kane-Mele SOC in ultra clean bilayer graphene. Using high-resolution capacitance measurements to probe the bulk electronic compressibility, we find that SOC leads to the formation of a distinct, incompressible, gapped phase at charge neutrality. The experimental data agree quantitatively with a simple theoretical model in which the new phase results from SOC-driven band inversion. In contrast to Kane-Mele SOC in monolayer graphene, the inverted phase is not expected to be a time-reversal-invariant topological insulator, despite being separated from conventional band insulators by electric-field-tuned phase transitions where crystal symmetry mandates that the bulk gap must close(22). Our electrical transport measurements reveal that the inverted phase has a conductivity of approximately e(2)/h (where e is the electron charge and h Planck's constant), which is suppressed by exceptionally small in-plane magnetic fields. The high conductivity and anomalous magnetoresistance are consistent with theoretical models that predict helical edge states within the inverted phase that are protected from backscattering by an emergent spin symmetry that remains robust even for large Rashba SOC. Our results pave the way for proximity engineering of strong topological insulators as well as correlated quantum phases in the strong spin-orbit regime in graphene heterostructures."], ["Accelerated discovery of CO<sub>2</sub> electrocatalysts using active machine learning", "The rapid increase in global energy demand and the need to replace carbon dioxide (CO2)-emitting fossil fuels with renewable sources have driven interest in chemical storage of intermittent solar and wind energy(1,2). Particularly attractive is the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to chemical feedstocks, which uses both CO2 and renewable energy(3-8). Copper has been the predominant electrocatalyst for this reaction when aiming for more valuable multi-carbon products(9-16), and process improvements have been particularly notable when targeting ethylene. However, the energy efficiency and productivity (current density) achieved so far still fall below the values required to produce ethylene at cost-competitive prices. Here we describe Cu-Al electrocatalysts, identified using density functional theory calculations in combination with active machine learning, that efficiently reduce CO2 to ethylene with the highest Faradaic efficiency reported so far. This Faradaic efficiency of over 80 per cent (compared to about 66 per cent for pure Cu) is achieved at a current density of 400 milliamperes per square centimetre (at 1.5 volts versus a reversible hydrogen electrode) and a cathodic-side (half-cell) ethylene power conversion efficiency of 55 +/- 2 per cent at 150 milliamperes per square centimetre. We perform computational studies that suggest that the Cu-Al alloys provide multiple sites and surface orientations with near-optimal CO binding for both efficient and selective CO2 reduction(17). Furthermore, in situ X-ray absorption measurements reveal that Cu and Al enable a favourable Cu coordination environment that enhances C-C dimerization. These findings illustrate the value of computation and machine learning in guiding the experimental exploration of multi-metallic systems that go beyond the limitations of conventional single-metal electrocatalysts."], ["Ceramic-metal composites for heat exchangers in concentrated solar power plants", "The efficiency of generating electricity from heat using concentrated solar power plants (which use mirrors or lenses to concentrate sunlight in order to drive heat engines, usually involving turbines) may be appreciably increased by operating with higher turbine inlet temperatures, but this would require improved heat exchanger materials. By operating turbines with inlet temperatures above 1,023 kelvin using closed-cycle high-pressure supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO(2)) recompression cycles, instead of using conventional (such as subcritical steam Rankine) cycles with inlet temperatures below 823 kelvin(1-3), the relative heat-to-electricity conversion efficiency may be increased by more than 20 per cent. The resulting reduction in the cost of dispatchable electricity from concentrated solar power plants (coupled with thermal energy storage(4-6)) would be an important step towards direct competition with fossil-fuel-based plants and a large reduction in greenhouse gas emissions(7). However, the inlet temperatures of closed-cycle high-pressure sCO(2) turbine systems are limited(8) by the thermomechanical performance of the compact, metal-alloy-based, printed-circuittype heat exchangers used to transfer heat to sCO(2). Here we present a robust composite of ceramic (zirconium carbide, ZrC) and the refractory metal tungsten (W) for use in printed-circuit-type heat exchangers at temperatures above 1,023 kelvin(9). This composite has attractive high-temperature thermal, mechanical and chemical properties and can be processed in a cost-effective manner. We fabricated ZrC/W-based heat exchanger plates with tunable channel patterns by the shape-and-size-preserving chemical conversion of porous tungsten carbide plates. The dense ZrC/W-based composites exhibited failure strengths of over 350 megapascals at 1,073 kelvin, and thermal conductivity values two to three times greater than those of iron- or nickel-based alloys at this temperature. Corrosion resistance to sCO(2) at 1,023 kelvin and 20 megapascals was achieved 19 by bonding a copper layer to the composite surface and adding 50 parts per million carbon monoxide to sCO(2). Techno-economic analyses indicate that ZrC/W-based heat exchangers can strongly outperform nickel-superalloy-based printed-circuit heat exchangers at lower cost."], ["Synthesis of cubic silicon nitride", "Silicon nitride (Si3N4) is used in a variety of important technological applications. The high fracture toughness, hardness and wear resistance of Si3N4-based ceramics are exploited in cutting tools and anti-friction bearings(1); in electronic applications, Si3N4 is used as an insulating, masking and passivating material(2). Two polymorphs of silicon nitride are known, both of hexagonal structure: alpha- and beta-Si3N4. Here we report the synthesis of a third polymorph of silicon nitride, which has a cubic spinel structure. This new phase, c-Si3N4, is formed at pressures above 15 GPa and temperatures exceeding 2,000 K, yet persists metastably in air at ambient pressure to at least 700 K. First-principles calculations of the properties of this phase suggest that the hardness of c-Si3N4 Should be comparable to that of the hardest known oxide (stishovite(3), a high-pressure phase of SiO2), and significantly greater than the hardness of the two hexagonal polymorphs."], ["Physiological blood-brain transport is impaired with age by a shift in transcytosis", "Tagging and tracking the blood plasma proteome as a discovery tool reveals widespread endogenous transport of proteins into the healthy brain and the pharmacologically modifiable mechanisms by which the brain endothelium regulates this process with age. The vascular interface of the brain, known as the blood-brain barrier (BBB), is understood to maintain brain function in part via its low transcellular permeability(1-3). Yet, recent studies have demonstrated that brain ageing is sensitive to circulatory proteins(4,5). Thus, it is unclear whether permeability to individually injected exogenous tracers-as is standard in BBB studies-fully represents blood-to-brain transport. Here we label hundreds of proteins constituting the mouse blood plasma proteome, and upon their systemic administration, study the BBB with its physiological ligand. We find that plasma proteins readily permeate the healthy brain parenchyma, with transport maintained by BBB-specific transcriptional programmes. Unlike IgG antibody, plasma protein uptake diminishes in the aged brain, driven by an age-related shift in transport from ligand-specific receptor-mediated to non-specific caveolar transcytosis. This age-related shift occurs alongside a specific loss of pericyte coverage. Pharmacological inhibition of the age-upregulated phosphatase ALPL, a predicted negative regulator of transport, enhances brain uptake of therapeutically relevant transferrin, transferrin receptor antibody and plasma. These findings reveal the extent of physiological protein transcytosis to the healthy brain, a mechanism of widespread BBB dysfunction with age and a strategy for enhanced drug delivery."], ["Field-driven photoemission from nanostructures quenches the quiver motion", "Strong-field physics, an extreme limit of light-matter interaction(1-3), is expanding into the realm of surfaces(4,5) and nanostructures(6-11) from its origin in atomic and molecular science(12-15). The attraction of nanostructures lies in two intimately connected features: local intensity enhancement and sub-wavelength confinement of optical fields. Local intensity enhancement facilitates access to the strong-field regime and has already sparked various applications, whereas spatial localization has the potential to generate strong-field dynamics exclusive to nanostructures. However, the observation of features unattainable in gaseous media is challenged by many-body effects and material damage, which arise under intense illumination of dense systems(16-19). Here, we non-destructively access this regime in the solid state by employing single plasmonic nanotips and few-cycle mid-infrared pulses, making use of the wavelength-dependence of the interaction, that is, the ponderomotive energy. We investigate strong-field photoelectron emission and acceleration from single nanostructures over a broad spectral range, and find kinetic energies of hundreds of electronvolts. We observe the transition to a new regime in strong-field dynamics, in which the electrons escape the nanolocalized field within a fraction of an optical half-cycle. The transition into this regime, characterized by a spatial adiabaticity parameter, would require relativistic electrons in the absence of nanostructures. These results establish new degrees of freedom for the manipulation and control of electron dynamics on femtosecond and attosecond timescales, combining optical near-fields and nanoscopic sources."], ["Machine-learning-assisted materials discovery using failed experiments", "Inorganic-organic hybrid materials(1-3) such as organically templated metal oxides(1), metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)(2) and organohalide perovskites(4) have been studied for decades, and hydrothermal and (non-aqueous) solvothermal syntheses have produced thousands of new materials that collectively contain nearly all the metals in the periodic table(5-9). Nevertheless, the formation of these compounds is not fully understood, and development of new compounds relies primarily on exploratory syntheses. Simulation-and data-driven approaches (promoted by efforts such as the Materials Genome Initiative(10)) provide an alternative to experimental trial-and-error. Three major strategies are: simulation-based predictions of physical properties (for example, charge mobility(11), photovoltaic properties(12), gas adsorption capacity(13) or lithium-ion intercalation(14)) to identify promising target candidates for synthetic efforts(11,15); determination of the structure-property relationship from large bodies of experimental data(16,17), enabled by integration with high-throughput synthesis and measurement tools(18); and clustering on the basis of similar crystallographic structure (for example, zeolite structure classification(19,20) or gas adsorption properties(21)). Here we demonstrate an alternative approach that uses machine-learning algorithms trained on reaction data to predict reaction outcomes for the crystallization of templated vanadium selenites. We used information on 'dark' reactions-failed or unsuccessful hydrothermal syntheses-collected from archived laboratory notebooks from our laboratory, and added physicochemical property descriptions to the raw notebook information using cheminformatics techniques. We used the resulting data to train a machine-learning model to predict reaction success. When carrying out hydrothermal synthesis experiments using previously untested, commercially available organic building blocks, our machine-learning model outperformed traditional human strategies, and successfully predicted conditions for new organically templated inorganic product formation with a success rate of 89 per cent. Inverting the machine-learning model reveals new hypotheses regarding the conditions for successful product formation."], ["Promises and prospects of two-dimensional transistors", "Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors have attracted tremendous interest as atomically thin channels that could facilitate continued transistor scaling. However, despite many proof-of-concept demonstrations, the full potential of 2D transistors has yet to be determined. To this end, the fundamental merits and technological limits of 2D transistors need a critical assessment and objective projection. Here we review the promise and current status of 2D transistors, and emphasize that widely used device parameters (such as carrier mobility and contact resistance) could be frequently misestimated or misinterpreted, and may not be the most reliable performance metrics for benchmarking 2D transistors. We suggest that the saturation or on-state current density, especially in the short-channel limit, could provide a more reliable measure for assessing the potential of diverse 2D semiconductors, and should be applied for cross-checking different studies, especially when milestone performance metrics are claimed. We also summarize the key technical challenges in optimizing the channels, contacts, dielectrics and substrates and outline potential pathways to push the performance limit of 2D transistors. We conclude with an overview of the critical technical targets, the key technological obstacles to the 'lab-to-fab' transition and the potential opportunities arising from the use of these atomically thin semiconductors."], ["Enantioselective [2+2]-cycloadditions with triplet photoenzymes", "Naturally evolved enzymes, despite their astonishingly large variety and functional diversity, operate predominantly through thermochemical activation. Integrating prominent photocatalysis modes into proteins, such astriplet energy transfer, could create artificial photoenzymes that expand the scope of natural biocatalysis(1-3). Here, we exploit genetically reprogrammed, chemically evolved photoenzymes embedded with a synthetic triplet photosensitizer that are capable of excited-state enantio-induction(4-6). Structural optimization through four rounds of directed evolution afforded proficient variants for the enantioselective intramolecular [2+2]-photocycloaddition of indole derivatives with good substrate generality and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% enantiomeric excess). A crystal structure of the photoenzyme-substrate complex elucidated the non-covalent interactions that mediate the reaction stereochemistry. This study expands the energy transfer reactivity(7-10) of artificial triplet photoenzymes in a supramolecular protein cavity and unlocks an integrated approach to valuable enantioselective photochemical synthesisthat is not accessible with either the synthetic orthe biological world alone."], ["Rigid tightly packed amino acid crystals as functional supramolecular materials", "The formation of ordered nanostructures by metabolites is gaining increased interest due to the simplicity of the building blocks and their natural occurrence. Specifically, aromatic amino acids possess the ability to form ordered supramolecular interactions due to their limited solubility in aqueous solution. Unexpectedly, l-tyrosine (l-Tyr) is almost 2 orders of magnitude less soluble in water compared to l-phenylalanine (l-Phe). However, the underlying mechanism is not fully understood as l-Tyr is more polar. Here, we explore the utilization of insoluble tyrosine assemblies for technological applications and their molecular basis by manipulating the basic building blocks of tightly packed dimers. We show that the addition of an amyloid inhibition agent increases l-Tyr solubility due to the disruption of the dimer formation. The molecular organization grants the l-Tyr crystal higher thermal stability and mechanical properties between three amino acids. Additionally, l-Tyr crystals are shown to generate high and stable piezoelectric power outputs under mechanical pressure in a sandwich device. By incorporating the rigid l-Tyr crystals into a soft polymer, a mechano-responsive bending composite was fabricated. Furthermore, the l-Tyr crystalline needles exhibit an active photowaveguiding property, making them promising candidates for the generation of photonic biomaterial-based devices. The present work exemplifies a feasible strategy to explore physical properties of supramolecular self-assemblies comprises minimalistic naturally occurring building blocks and their applications in energy harvesting, photonic devices, stretchable electronics, and soft robotics."], ["Human occupation of northern Australia by 65,000 years ago", "The time of arrival of people in Australia is an unresolved question. It is relevant to debates about when modern humans first dispersed out of Africa and when their descendants incorporated genetic material from Neanderthals, Denisovans and possibly other hominins. Humans have also been implicated in the extinction of Australia's megafauna. Here we report the results of new excavations conducted at Madjedbebe, a rock shelter in northern Australia. Artefacts in primary depositional context are concentrated in three dense bands, with the stratigraphic integrity of the deposit demonstrated by artefact refits and by optical dating and other analyses of the sediments. Human occupation began around 65,000 years ago, with a distinctive stone tool assemblage including grinding stones, ground ochres, reflective additives and ground-edge hatchet heads. This evidence sets a new minimum age for the arrival of humans in Australia, the dispersal of modern humans out of Africa, and the subsequent interactions of modern humans with Neanderthals and Denisovans."], ["Giant modulation of optical nonlinearity by Floquet engineering", "Strong periodic driving with light offers the potential to coherently manipulate the properties of quantum materials on ultrafast timescales. Recently, strategies have emerged to drastically alter electronic and magnetic properties by optically inducing non-trivial band topologies(1-6), emergent spin interactions(7-11) and even superconductivity(12). However, the prospects and methods of coherently engineering optical properties on demand are far less understood(13). Here we demonstrate coherent control and giant modulation of optical nonlinearity in a van der Waals layered magnetic insulator, manganese phosphorus trisulfide (MnPS3). By driving far off-resonance from the lowest on-site manganese d-d transition, we observe a coherent on-off switching of its optical second harmonic generation efficiency on the timescale of 100 femtoseconds with no measurable dissipation. At driving electric fields of the order of 10(9) volts per metre, the on-off ratio exceeds 10, which is limited only by the sample damage threshold. Floquet theory calculations(14) based on a single-ion model of MnPS3 are able to reproduce the measured driving field amplitude and polarization dependence of the effect. Our approach can be applied to a broad range of insulating materials and could lead to dynamically designed nonlinear optical elements."], ["Electrophilic properties of itaconate and derivatives regulate the I\u03baB\u03b6-ATF3 inflammatory axis", "Metabolic regulation has been recognized as a powerful principle guiding immune responses. Inflammatory macrophages undergo extensive metabolic rewiring(1) marked by the production of substantial amounts of itaconate, which has recently been described as an immunoregulatory metabolite(2). Itaconate and its membrane-permeable derivative dimethyl itaconate (DI) selectively inhibit a subset of cytokines(2), including IL-6 and IL-12 but not TNF. The major effects of itaconate on cellular metabolism during macrophage activation have been attributed to the inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase(2,3), yet this inhibition alone is not sufficient to account for the pronounced immunoregulatory effects observed in the case of DI. Furthermore, the regulatory pathway responsible for such selective effects of itaconate and DI on the inflammatory program has not been defined. Here we show that itaconate and DI induce electrophilic stress, react with glutathione and subsequently induce both Nrf2 (also known as NFE2L2)-dependent and -independent responses. We find that electrophilic stress can selectively regulate secondary, but not primary, transcriptional responses to toll-like receptor stimulation via inhibition of I kappa B zeta protein induction. The regulation of I kappa B zeta is independent of Nrf2, and we identify ATF3 as its key mediator. The inhibitory effect is conserved across species and cell types, and the in vivo administration of DI can ameliorate IL-17-I kappa B zeta driven skin pathology in a mouse model of psoriasis, highlighting the therapeutic potential of this regulatory pathway. Our results demonstrate that targeting the DI-I kappa B zeta regulatory axis could be an important new strategy for the treatment of IL-17-I kappa B zeta-mediated autoimmune diseases."], ["The epichaperome is an integrated chaperome network that facilitates tumour survival", "Transient, multi-protein complexes are important facilitators of cellular functions. This includes the chaperome, an abundant protein family comprising chaperones, co-chaperones, adaptors, and folding enzymes-dynamic complexes of which regulate cellular homeostasis together with the protein degradation machinery(1-6). Numerous studies have addressed the role of chaperome members in isolation, yet little is known about their relationships regarding how they interact and function together in malignancy(7-17). As function is probably highly dependent on endogenous conditions found in native tumours, chaperomes have resisted investigation, mainly due to the limitations of methods needed to disrupt or engineer the cellular environment to facilitate analysis. Such limitations have led to a bottleneck in our understanding of chaperome-related disease biology and in the development of chaperome-targeted cancer treatment. Here we examined the chaperome complexes in a large set of tumour specimens. The methods used maintained the endogenous native state of tumours and we exploited this to investigate the molecular characteristics and composition of the chaperome in cancer, the molecular factors that drive chaperome networks to crosstalk in tumours, the distinguishing factors of the chaperome in tumours sensitive to pharmacologic inhibition, and the characteristics of tumours that may benefit from chaperome therapy. We find that under conditions of stress, such as malignant transformation fuelled by MYC, the chaperome becomes biochemically 'rewired' to form a network of stable, survival-facilitating, high-molecular-weight complexes. The chaperones heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and heat shock cognate protein 70 (HSC70) are nucleating sites for these physically and functionally integrated complexes. The results indicate that these tightly integrated chaperome units, here termed the epichaperome, can function as a network to enhance cellular survival, irrespective of tissue of origin or genetic background. The epichaperome, present in over half of all cancers tested, has implications for diagnostics and also provides potential vulnerability as a target for drug intervention."], ["Bimetallic Catalysis in Stereodivergent Synthesis", "Bimetallic catalysis has emerged as an efficient strategy for the development of new chemical reactions. Importantly, this strategy also provides a simple and powerful platform for stereodivergent synthesis, whereby all the possible stereoisomers of products bearing two stereocenters can be easily prepared from the same set of starting materials. In this Minireview, the development of stereodivergent allylic substitution, propargylic substitution, hydrofunctionalization, and annulation based on bimetallic catalysis has been summarized. It is expected that more bimetallic catalytic systems will be developed and applied for the stereodivergent synthesis of valuable molecules."], ["Effect of strain on the reactivity of metal surfaces", "Self-consistent density functional calculations for the adsorption of O and CO, and the dissociation of CO on strained and unstrained Ru(0001) surfaces are used to show how strained metal surfaces have chemical properties that are significantly different from those of unstrained surfaces.

Dislocation obstacles such as grain boundaries(4), twin boundaries(5), solute atoms(6) and precipitates(7-9) can increase strength. However, with few exceptions(8-11) such obstacles tend to decrease ductility. Interestingly, precipitates can also hinder phase transformations(12-13). Here, using a model, precipitate-strengthened, Fe-Ni-Al-Ti medium-entropy alloy, we demonstrate a strategy that combinesthese dual functions in a single alloy. The nanoprecipitates in our alloy, in addition to providing conventional strengthening of the matrix, also modulate itstransformation from fcc-austenite to body-centred cubic (bcc) martensite, constraining it to remain as metastable fcc after quenching through the transformation temperature. During subsequent tensile testing, the matrix progressively transformsto bcc-martensite, enabling substantial increases in strength, work hardening and ductility. This use of nanoprecipitates exploits synergies between precipitation strengthening and transformation-induced plasticity, resulting in simultaneous enhancement oftensile strength and uniform elongation. Our findings demonstrate how synergistic deformation mechanisms can be deliberately activated, exactly when needed, by altering precipitate characteristics (such as size, spacing, and so on), along with the chemical driving force for phase transformation, to optimize strength and ductility."], ["Increasing the conductivity of crystalline polymer electrolytes", "Polymer electrolytes consist of salts dissolved in polymers ( for example, polyethylene oxide, PEO), and represent a unique class of solid coordination compounds. They have potential applications in a diverse range of all-solid-state devices, such as rechargeable lithium batteries, flexible electrochromic displays and smart windows(1-5). For 30 years, attention was focused on amorphous polymer electrolytes in the belief that crystalline polymer: salt complexes were insulators. This view has been overturned recently by demonstrating ionic conductivity in the crystalline complexes PEO6: LiXF6 (X=P, As, Sb); however, the conductivities were relatively low(6,7). Here we demonstrate an increase of 1.5 orders of magnitude in the conductivity of these materials by replacing a small proportion of the XF6- anions in the crystal structure with isovalent N(SO2CF3)(2)(-) ions. We suggest that the larger and more irregularly shaped anions disrupt the potential around the Li+ ions, thus enhancing the ionic conductivity in a manner somewhat analogous to the AgBr1-xIx ionic conductors(8). The demonstration that doping strategies can enhance the conductivity of crystalline polymer electrolytes represents a significant advance towards the technological exploitation of such materials."], ["<i>MICU1</i> encodes a mitochondrial EF hand protein required for Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> uptake", "Mitochondrial calcium uptake has a central role in cell physiology by stimulating ATP production, shaping cytosolic calcium transients and regulating cell death. The biophysical properties of mitochondrial calcium uptake have been studied in detail, but the underlying proteins remain elusive. Here we use an integrative strategy to predict human genes involved in mitochondrial calcium entry based on clues from comparative physiology, evolutionary genomics and organelle proteomics. RNA interference against 13 top candidates highlighted one gene, CBARA1, that we call hereafter mitochondrial calcium uptake 1 (MICU1). Silencing MICU1 does not disrupt mitochondrial respiration or membrane potential but abolishes mitochondrial calcium entry in intact and permeabilized cells, and attenuates the metabolic coupling between cytosolic calcium transients and activation of matrix dehydrogenases. MICU1 is associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane and has two canonical EF hands that are essential for its activity, indicating a role in calcium sensing. MICU1 represents the founding member of a set of proteins required for high-capacity mitochondrial calcium uptake. Its discovery may lead to the complete molecular characterization of mitochondrial calcium uptake pathways, and offers genetic strategies for understanding their contribution to normal physiology and disease."], ["A distinct abundant group of microbial rhodopsins discovered using functional metagenomics", "Many organisms capture or sense sunlight using rhodopsin pigments(1,2), which are integral membrane proteins that bind retinal chromophores. Rhodopsins comprise two distinct protein families(1), type-1 (microbial rhodopsins) and type-2 (animal rhodopsins). The two families share similar topologies and contain seven transmembrane helices that form a pocket in which retinal is linked covalently as a protonated Schiff base to a lysine at the seventh transmembrane helix(2,3). Type-1 and type-2 rhodopsins show little or no sequence similarity to each other, as a consequence of extensive divergence from a common ancestor or convergent evolution of similar structures1. Here we report a previously unknown and diverse family of rhodopsins-which we term the heliorhodopsins-that we identified using functional metagenomics and that are distantly related to type-1 rhodopsins. Heliorhodopsins are embedded in the membrane with their N termini facing the cell cytoplasm, an orientation that is opposite to that of type-1 or type-2 rhodopsins. Heliorhodopsins show photocycles that are longer than one second, which is suggestive of light-sensory activity. Heliorhodopsin photocycles accompany retinal isomerization and proton transfer, as in type-1 and type-2 rhodopsins, but protons are never released from the protein, even transiently. Heliorhodopsins are abundant and distributed globally; we detected them in Archaea, Bacteria, Eukarya and their viruses. Our findings reveal a previously unknown family of light-sensing rhodopsins that are widespread in the microbial world."], ["Enhanced electrocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub> reduction via field-induced reagent concentration", "Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to carbon monoxide (CO) is the first step in the synthesis of more complex carbon-based fuels and feedstocks using renewable electricity(1-7). Unfortunately, the reaction suffers from slow kinetics(7,8) owing to the low local concentration of CO2 surrounding typical CO2 reduction reaction catalysts. Alkali metal cations are known to overcome this limitation through non-covalent interactions with adsorbed reagent species(9,10), but the effect is restricted by the solubility of relevant salts. Large applied electrode potentials can also enhance CO2 adsorption(11), but this comes at the cost of increased hydrogen (H-2) evolution. Here we report that nanostructured electrodes produce, at low applied overpotentials, local high electric fields that concentrate electrolyte cations, which in turn leads to a high local concentration of CO2 close to the active CO2 reduction reaction surface. Simulations reveal tenfold higher electric fields associated with metallic nanometre-sized tips compared to quasi-planar electrode regions, and measurements using gold nanoneedles confirm a field-induced reagent concentration that enables the CO2 reduction reaction to proceed with a geometric current density for CO of 22 milliamperes per square centimetre at -0.35 volts (overpotential of 0.24 volts). This performance surpasses by an order of magnitude the performance of the best gold nanorods, nanoparticles and oxide-derived noble metal catalysts. Similarly designed palladium nanoneedle electrocatalysts produce formate with a Faradaic efficiency of more than 90 per cent and an unprecedented geometric current density for formate of 10 milliamperes per square centimetre at -0.2 volts, demonstrating the wider applicability of the field-induced reagent concentration concept."], ["The complete sequence of a human Y chromosome", "The human Y chromosome has been notoriously difficult to sequence and assemble because of its complex repeat structure that includes long palindromes, tandem repeats and segmental duplications1-3.

In particular, the realization of nanoscale switching devices might have far-reaching implications for computing and biomimetic engineering(2-4). But miniaturization of existing semiconductor technology may not be the best approach to the fabrication of structures whose dimensions are smaller than the wavelength of the radiation used in optical lithography and etching techniques(5). The approach observed in the natural world, whereby nanostructures are built up through the self-assembly(6-9) of smaller molecular entities, holds substantial promise. Nature abounds with molecular switching devices which perform a variety of functions, such as the transport of metabolites across cell membranes or the signalling of nerve impulses. These processes are commonly controlled by stimuli such as changes in ion concentrations and electrical potentials. Here we report the synthesis of a supramolecular structure (compound 1.[PF6](4), Fig. 1A) that can be reversibly switched between two states by proton concentration changes or by electrochemical means. The supermolecule is a rotaxane comprising a molecular ring threaded on an axle containing two 'docking points'.

One recent experiment 6 used the tip of an atomic force microscope (AFM) to manipulate multi-walled nanotubes, revealing that changes in the sample resistance were small unless the nanotubes fractured or the metal-tube contacts were perturbed. But it remains unclear how mechanical deformation affects the intrinsic electrical properties of nanotubes. Here we report an experimental and theoretical elucidation of the electromechanical characteristics of individual single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) under local-probe manipulation. We use AFM tips to deflect suspended SWNTs reversibly, without changing the contact resistance; in situ electrical measurements reveal that the conductance of an SWNT sample can be reduced by two orders of magnitude when deformed by an AFM tip. Our tight-binding simulations indicate that this effect is owing to the formation of local sp(3) bonds caused by the mechanical pushing action of the tip."], ["Toughening Elastomers with Sacrificial Bonds and Watching Them Break", "Elastomers are widely used because of their large-strain reversible deformability. Most unfilled elastomers suffer from a poor mechanical strength, which limits their use. Using sacrificial bonds, we show how brittle, unfilled elastomers can be strongly reinforced in stiffness and toughness (up to 4 megapascals and 9 kilojoules per square meter) by introducing a variable proportion of isotropically prestretched chains that can break and dissipate energy before the material fails. Chemoluminescent cross-linking molecules, which emit light as they break, map in real time where and when many of these internal bonds break ahead of a propagating crack. The simple methodology that we use to introduce sacrificial bonds, combined with the mapping of where bonds break, has the potential to stimulate the development of new classes of unfilled tough elastomers and better molecular models of the fracture of soft materials."], ["The origin of bursts and heavy tails in human dynamics", "The dynamics of many social, technological and economic phenomena are driven by individual human actions, turning the quantitative understanding of human behaviour into a central question of modern science. Current models of human dynamics, used from risk assessment to communications, assume that human actions are randomly distributed in time and thus well approximated by Poisson processes(1-3). In contrast, there is increasing evidence that the timing of many human activities, ranging from communication to entertainment and work patterns, follow non-Poisson statistics, characterized by bursts of rapidly occurring events separated by long periods of inactivity(4-8). Here I show that the bursty nature of human behaviour is a consequence of a decision-based queuing process(9,10): when individuals execute tasks based on some perceived priority, the timing of the tasks will be heavy tailed, with most tasks being rapidly executed, whereas a few experience very long waiting times. In contrast, random or priority blind execution is well approximated by uniform inter-event statistics. These finding have important implications, ranging from resource management to service allocation, in both communications and retail."], ["Complete nitrification by <i>Nitrospira</i> bacteria", "Nitrification, the oxidation of ammonia via nitrite to nitrate, has always been considered to be a two-step process catalysed by chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms oxidizing either ammonia or nitrite. No known nitrifier carries out both steps, although complete nitrification should be energetically advantageous. This functional separation has puzzled microbiologists for a century. Here we report on the discovery and cultivation of a completely nitrifying bacterium from the genus Nitrospira, a globally distributed group of nitrite oxidizers. The genome of this chemolithoautotrophic organism encodes the pathways both for ammonia and nitrite oxidation, which are concomitantly expressed during growth by ammonia oxidation to nitrate. Genes affiliated with the phylogenetically distinct ammonia monooxygenase and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase genes of Nitrospira are present in many environments and were retrieved on Nitrospira-contigs in new metagenomes from engineered systems. These findings fundamentally change our picture of nitrification and point to completely nitrifying Nitrospira as key components of nitrogen-cycling microbial communities."], ["All-angle negative refraction and active flat lensing of ultraviolet light", "Decades ago, Veselago(1) predicted that a material with simultaneously negative electric and magnetic polarization responses would yield a 'left-handed' medium in which light propagates with opposite phase and energy velocities-a condition described by a negative refractive index. He proposed that a flat slab of left-handed material possessing an isotropic refractive index of 21 could act like an imaging lens in free space. Left-handed materials do not occur naturally, and it has only recently become possible to achieve a left-handed response using metamaterials, that is, electromagnetic structures engineered on subwavelength scales to elicit tailored polarization responses. So far, left-handed responses have typically been implemented using resonant metamaterials composed of periodic arrays of unit cells containing inductive-capacitive resonators and conductive wires. Negative refractive indices that are isotropic in two(2) or three(3) dimensions at microwave frequencies have been achieved in resonant metamaterials with centimetre-scale features. Scaling the left-handed response to higher frequencies, such as infrared or visible, has been done by shrinking critical dimensions to submicrometre scales by means of top-down nanofabrication(4). This miniaturization has, however, so far been achieved at the cost of reduced unit-cell symmetry, yielding a refractive index that is negative along only one axis. Moreover, lithographic scaling limits have so far precluded the fabrication of resonant metamaterials with left-handed responses at frequencies beyond the visible(5). Here we report the experimental implementation of a bulk metamaterial with a left-handed response to ultraviolet light. The structure, based on stacked plasmonic waveguides(6), yields an omnidirectional left-handed response for transverse magnetic polarization characterized by a negative refractive index. By engineering the structure to have a refractive index close to -1 over a broad angular range, we achieve Veselago flat lensing, in free space, of arbitrarily shaped, two-dimensional objects beyond the near field. We further demonstrate active, all-optical modulation of the image transferred by the flat lens."], ["Automated self-optimization, intensification, and scale-up of photocatalysis in flow", "There has been an extraordinary burst of recent research in photochemistry and photocatalysis driven in part by the environmentally benign appeal of light as a source of reactivity. However, many of the studies showcase small-scale reactions, and scale-up relies on a patchwork of different technologies that can require substantial trial and error to optimize. Slattery et al. report a combined software and hardware platform that iteratively determines optimal, substrate-specific conditions for photochemical processes in a scalable, flow-based architecture. The closed-loop Bayesian optimization approach enhances overall and space-time yields of a variety of distinct reactions."], ["Visualizing vibrational normal modes of a single molecule with atomically confined light", "The internal vibrations of molecules drive the structural transformations that underpin chemistry and cellular function. While vibrational frequencies are measured by spectroscopy, the normal modes of motion are inferred through theory because their visualization would require microscopy with angstrom-scale spatial resolution-nearly three orders of magnitude smaller than the diffraction limit in optics(1). Using a metallic tip to focus light and taking advantage of the surface-enhanced Raman effect(2) to amplify the signal from individual molecules, tip-enhanced Raman spectromicroscopy (TER-SM)(3,4) reaches the requisite sub-molecular spatial resolution(5), confirming that light can be confined in picocavities(6-10) and anticipating the direct visualization of molecular vibrations(11-13). Here, by using TER-SM at the precisely controllable junction of a cryogenic ultrahigh-vacuum scanning tunnelling microscope(14-16), we show that angstrom-scale resolution is attained at subatomic separation between the tip atom and a molecule in the quantum tunnelling regime of plasmons(6,8,9,17). We record vibrational spectra within a single molecule, obtain images of normal modes and atomically parse the intramolecular charges and currents driven by vibrations. Our analysis provides a paradigm for optics in the atomistic near-field."], ["Hydroxamic acid pre-adsorption raises the efficiency of cosensitized solar cells", "Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) convert light into electricity by using photosensitizers adsorbed on the surface of nanocrystalline mesoporous titanium dioxide (TiO2) films along with electrolytes or solid charge-transport materials(1-3). They possess many features including transparency, multicolour and low-cost fabrication, and are being deployed in glass facades, skylights and greenhouses(4). Recent development of sensitizers(5-10), redox mediators(11-13) and device structures(14) has improved the performance of DSCs, particularly under ambient light conditions(14-17). To further enhance their efficiency, it is pivotal to control the assembly of dye molecules on the surface of TiO2 to favour charge generation. Here we report a route of pre-adsorbing a monolayer of a hydroxamic acid derivative on the surface of TiO2 to improve the dye molecular packing and photovoltaic performance of two newly designed co-adsorbed sensitizers that harvest light quantitatively across the entire visible domain. The best performing cosensitized solar cells exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 15.2% (which has been independently confirmed) under a standard air mass of 1.5 global simulated sunlight, and showed long-term operational stability (500 h). Devices with a larger active area of 2.8 cm(2) exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 28.4% to 30.2% over a wide range of ambient light intensities, along with high stability. Our findings pave the way for facile access to high-performance DSCs and offer promising prospects for applications as power supplies and battery replacements for low-power electronic devices(18-20) that use ambient light as their energy source."], ["Intercellular interaction dictates cancer cell ferroptosis via NF2-YAP signalling", "Ferroptosis, a cell death process driven by cellular metabolism and iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, has been implicated in diseases such as ischaemic organ damage and cancer(1,2). The enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) is a central regulator of ferroptosis, and protects cells by neutralizing lipid peroxides, which are by-products of cellular metabolism. The direct inhibition of GPX4, or indirect inhibition by depletion of its substrate glutathione or the building blocks of glutathione (such as cysteine), can trigger ferroptosis(3). Ferroptosis contributes to the antitumour function of several tumour suppressors such as p53, BAP1 and fumarase(4-7). Counterintuitively, mesenchymal cancer cells-which are prone to metastasis, and often resistant to various treatments-are highly susceptible to ferroptosis(8,9). Here we show that ferroptosis can be regulated non-cell-autonomously by cadherin-mediated intercellular interactions. In epithelial cells, such interactions mediated by E-cadherin suppress ferroptosis by activating the intracellular NF2 (also known as merlin) and Hippo signalling pathway. Antagonizing this signalling axis allows the protooncogenic transcriptional co-activator YAP to promote ferroptosis by upregulating several ferroptosis modulators, including ACSL4 and TFRC. This finding provides mechanistic insights into the observations that cancer cells with mesenchymal or metastatic property are highly sensitive to ferroptosis(8). Notably, a similar mechanism also modulates ferroptosis in some non-epithelial cells. Finally, genetic inactivation of the tumour suppressor NF2, a frequent tumorigenic event in mesothelioma(10,11), rendered cancer cells more sensitive to ferroptosis in an orthotopic mouse model of malignant mesothelioma. Our results demonstrate the role of intercellular interactions and intracellular NF2-YAP signalling in dictating ferroptotic death, and also suggest that malignant mutations in NF2-YAP signalling could predict the responsiveness of cancer cells to future ferroptosis-inducing therapies."], ["Li metal deposition and stripping in a solid-state battery via Coble creep", "Solid-state lithium metal batteries require accommodation of electrochemically generated mechanical stress inside the lithium: this stress can be(1,2) up to 1 gigapascal for an overpotential of 135 millivolts. Maintaining the mechanical and electrochemical stability of the solid structure despite physical contact with moving corrosive lithium metal is a demanding requirement. Using in situ transmission electron microscopy, we investigated the deposition and stripping of metallic lithium or sodium held within a large number of parallel hollow tubules made of a mixed ionic-electronic conductor (MIEC). Here we show that these alkali metals-as single crystals-can grow out of and retract inside the tubules via mainly diffusional Coble creep along the MIEC/metal phase boundary. Unlike solid electrolytes, many MIECs are electrochemically stable in contact with lithium (that is, there is a direct tie-line to metallic lithium on the equilibrium phase diagram), so this Coble creep mechanism can effectively relieve stress, maintain electronic and ionic contacts, eliminate solid-electrolyte interphase debris, and allow the reversible deposition/stripping of lithium across a distance of 10 micrometres for 100 cycles. A centimetre-wide full cell-consisting of approximately 10(10) MIEC cylinders/solid electrolyte/LiFePO4-shows a high capacity of about 164 milliampere hours per gram of LiFePO4, and almost no degradation for over 50 cycles, starting with a 1x excess of Li. Modelling shows that the design is insensitive to MIEC material choice with channels about 100 nanometres wide and 10-100 micrometres deep. The behaviour of lithium metal within the MIEC channels suggests that the chemical and mechanical stability issues with the metal-electrolyte interface in solid-state lithium metal batteries can be overcome using this architecture. By containing lithium metal within oriented tubes of a mixed ionic-electronic conductor, a 3D anode for lithium metal batteries is produced that overcomes chemomechanical stability issues at the electrolyte interface."], ["Catalytic Cleavage of C(sp2)\u2013C(sp2) Bonds with Rh-Carbynoids", "We report a catalytic strategy that generates rhodium-carbynoids by selective diazo activation of designed carbyne sources. We found that rhodium-carbynoid species provoke C(sp2)\u2013C(sp2) bond scission in alkenes by inserting a monovalent carbon unit between both sp2-hybridized carbons. This skeletal remodeling process accesses synthetically useful allyl cation intermediates that conduct to valuable allylic building blocks upon nucleophile attack.

Recent controversial reports(11,12) claim the observation of neutrons from deuterium - deuterium fusion during acoustic cavitation(11,12.) However, there has been previously no strong experimental evidence for the existence of a plasma during single- or multi-bubble sonoluminescence. SBSL typically produces featureless emission spectra(13) that reveal little about the intra-cavity physical conditions or chemical processes. Here we report observations of atomic (Ar) emission and extensive molecular (SO) and ionic (O-2(+)) progressions in SBSL spectra from concentrated aqueous H2SO4 solutions. Both the Ar and SO emission permit spectroscopic temperature determinations, as accomplished for multi-bubble sonoluminescence with other emitters(14-16). The emissive excited states observed from both Ar and O-2(+) are inconsistent with any thermal process. The Ar excited states involved are extremely high in energy (> 13 eV) and cannot be thermally populated at the measured Ar emission temperatures (4,000 - 15,000 K); the ionization energy of O-2 is more than twice its bond dissociation energy, so O-2(+) likewise cannot be thermally produced. We therefore conclude that these emitting species must originate from collisions with high-energy electrons, ions or particles from a hot plasma core."], ["Hierarchically porous polymer coatings for highly efficient passive daytime radiative cooling", "Passive daytime radiative cooling (PDRC) involves spontaneously cooling a surface by reflecting sunlight and radiating heat to the cold outer space. Current PDRC designs are promising alternatives to electrical cooling but are either inefficient or have limited applicability. We present a simple, inexpensive, and scalable phase inversion\u2013based method for fabricating hierarchically porous poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropene) [P(VdF-HFP)HP] coatings with excellent PDRC capability. High, substrate-independent hemispherical solar reflectances (0.96 \u00b1 0.03) and long-wave infrared emittances (0.97 \u00b1 0.02) allow for subambient temperature drops of ~6\u00b0C and cooling powers of ~96 watts per square meter (W m\u22122) under solar intensities of 890 and 750 W m\u22122, respectively. The performance equals or surpasses those of state-of-the-art PDRC designs, and the technique offers a paint-like simplicity."], ["Soft colloids make strong glasses", "Glass formation in colloidal suspensions has many of the hallmarks of glass formation in molecular materials(1-5). For hard-sphere colloids, which interact only as a result of excluded volume, phase behaviour is controlled by volume fraction, phi; an increase in phi drives the system towards its glassy state, analogously to a decrease in temperature, T, in molecular systems. When phi increases above phi* approximate to 0.53, the viscosity starts to increase significantly, and the system eventually moves out of equilibrium at the glass transition, phi(g) approximate to 0.58, where particle crowding greatly restricts structural relaxation(1-4). The large particle size makes it possible to study both structure and dynamics with light scattering(1) and imaging(3,4); colloidal suspensions have therefore provided considerable insight into the glass transition. However, hard-sphere colloidal suspensions do not exhibit the same diversity of behaviour as molecular glasses. This is highlighted by the wide variation in behaviour observed for the viscosity or structural relaxation time, tau(alpha), when the glassy state is approached in supercooled molecular liquids(5). This variation is characterized by the unifying concept of fragility(5), which has spurred the search for a 'universal' description of dynamic arrest in glass-forming liquids. For 'fragile' liquids, tau(alpha) is highly sensitive to changes in T, whereas non-fragile, or 'strong', liquids show a much lower T sensitivity. In contrast, hard-sphere colloidal suspensions are restricted to fragile behaviour, as determined by their phi dependence(1,6), ultimately limiting their utility in the study of the glass transition. Here we show that deformable colloidal particles, when studied through their concentration dependence at fixed temperature, do exhibit the same variation in fragility as that observed in the T dependence of molecular liquids at fixed volume. Their fragility is dictated by elastic properties on the scale of individual colloidal particles. Furthermore, we find an equivalent effect in molecular systems, where elasticity directly reflects fragility. Colloidal suspensions may thus provide new insight into glass formation in molecular systems."], ["A single-molecule van der Waals compass", "Single-molecule imaging is challenging but highly beneficial for investigating intermolecular interactions at the molecular level(1-6). Van der Waals interactions at the sub-nanometre scale strongly influence various molecular behaviours under confinement conditions(7-11). Inspired by the traditional compass(12), here we use a para-xylene molecule as a rotating pointer to detect the host-guest van der Waals interactions in the straight channel of the MFI-type zeolite framework. We use integrated differential phase contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy(13-15) to achieve real-space imaging of a single para-xylene molecule in each channel. A good correlation between the orientation of the single-molecule pointer and the atomic structure of the channel is established by combining the results of calculations and imaging studies. The orientations of para-xylene help us to identify changes in the van der Waals interactions, which are related to the channel geometry in both spatial and temporal dimensions. This work not only provides a visible and sensitive means to investigate host-guest van der Waals interactions in porous materials at the molecular level, but also encourages the further study of other single-molecule behaviours using electron microscopy techniques."], ["Hydrogen-bond kinetics in liquid water", "HYDROGEN bonds play a crucial role in the behaviour of water(1-4); their spatial patterns and fluctuations characterize the structure and dynamics of the liquid(5-7). The processes of breaking and making hydrogen bonds in tile condensed phase can be probed indirectly by a variety of experimental techniques(8), and more quantitative information can be obtained from computer simulations(9). In particular, simulations have revealed that on long timescales the relaxation behaviour of hydrogen bonds in liquid water exhibit non-exponential kinetics(7,10-13), suggesting that bond making and breaking are not simple processes characterized by well defined rate constants. Here we show that these kinetics can be understood in terms of an interplay between diffusion and hydrogen-bond dynamics. In our model, which can be extended to other hydrogen-bonded liquids, diffusion governs whether a specific pair of water molecules are near neighbours, and hydrogen bonds between such pairs form and persist at random with average lifetimes determined by rate constants for bond making and breaking."], ["Quantum computers", "Over the past several decades, quantum information science has emerged to seek answers to the question: can we gain some advantage by storing, transmitting and processing information encoded in systems that exhibit unique quantum properties? Today it is understood that the answer is yes, and many research groups around the world are working towards the highly ambitious technological goal of building a quantum computer, which would dramatically improve computational power for particular tasks. A number of physical systems, spanning much of modern physics, are being developed for quantum computation. However, it remains unclear which technology, if any, will ultimately prove successful. Here we describe the latest developments for each of the leading approaches and explain the major challenges for the future."], ["A STAT3 palmitoylation cycle promotes T<sub>H</sub>17 differentiation and colitis", "Cysteine palmitoylation (S-palmitoylation) is a reversible post-translational modification that is installed by the DHHC family of palmitoyltransferases and is reversed by several acyl protein thioesterases(1,2). Although thousands of human proteins are known to undergo S-palmitoylation, how this modification is regulated to modulate specific biological functions is poorly understood. Here we report that the key T helper 17 (T(H)17) cell differentiation stimulator, STAT3(3,4), is subject to reversible S-palmitoylation on cysteine 108. DHHC7 palmitoylates STAT3 and promotes its membrane recruitment and phosphorylation. Acyl protein thioesterase 2 (APT2, also known as LYPLA2) depalmitoylates phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3) and enables it to translocate to the nucleus. This palmitoylation-depalmitoylation cycle enhances STAT3 activation and promotes T(H)17 cell differentiation; perturbation of either palmitoylation or depalmitoylation negatively affects T(H)17 cell differentiation. Overactivation of T(H)17 cells is associated with several inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In a mouse model, pharmacological inhibition of APT2 or knockout ofZdhhc7-which encodes DHHC7-relieves the symptoms of IBD. Our study reveals not only a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of IBD but also a model through which S-palmitoylation regulates cell signalling, which might be broadly applicable for understanding the signalling functions of numerous S-palmitoylation events. The dynamic and reversible S-palmitoylation of the transcription factor STAT3 enhances its activation and promotes the differentiation of T(H)17 cells."], ["Intrinsic toughening and stable crack propagation in hexagonal boron nitride", "If a bulk material can withstand a high load without any irreversible damage (such as plastic deformation), it is usually brittle and can fail catastrophically(1,2). This trade-off between strength and fracture toughness also extends into two-dimensional materials space(3-5). For example, graphene has ultrahigh intrinsic strength (about 130 gigapascals) and elastic modulus (approximately 1.0 terapascal) but is brittle, with low fracture toughness (about 4 megapascals per square-root metre)(3,6). Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is a dielectric two-dimensional material(7) with high strength (about 100 gigapascals) and elastic modulus (approximately 0.8 terapascals), which are similar to those of graphene(8). Its fracture behaviour has long been assumed to be similarly brittle, subject to Griffith's law(9-14). Contrary to expectation, here we report high fracture toughness of single-crystal monolayer h-BN, with an effective energy release rate up to one order of magnitude higher than both its Griffith energy release rate and that reported for graphene. We observe stable crack propagation in monolayer h-BN, and obtain the corresponding crack resistance curve. Crack deflection and branching occur repeatedly owing to asymmetric edge elastic properties at the crack tip and edge swapping during crack propagation, which intrinsically toughens the material and enables stable crack propagation. Our in situ experimental observations, supported by theoretical analysis, suggest added practical benefits and potential new technological opportunities for monolayer h-BN, such as adding mechanical protection to two-dimensional devices."], ["Molecular basis of agonism and antagonism in the oestrogen receptor", "Oestrogens are involved in the growth, development and homeostasis of a number of tissues(1). The physiological effects of these steroids are mediated by a ligand-inducible nuclear transcription factor, the oestrogen receptor (ER)(2). Hormone binding to the ligand-binding domain (LED) of the ER initiates a series of molecular events culminating in the activation or repression of target genes, Transcriptional regulation arises from the direct interaction of the ER with components of the cellular transcription machinery(3,4). Here we report the crystal structures of the LED of ER in complex with the endogenous oestrogen, 17 beta-oestradiol, and the selective antagonist raloxifene(5), at resolutions of 3.1 and 2.6 Angstrom, respectively. The structures provide a molecular basis for the distinctive pharmacophore of the ER and its catholic binding properties, Agonist and antagonist bind at the same site within the core of the LED but demonstrate different binding modes, In addition, each class of ligand induces a distinct conformation in the transactivation domain of the LED, providing structural evidence of the mechanism of antagonism."], ["N-Boc Amines to Oxazolidinones via Pd(II)/Bis-sulfoxide/Br\u00f8nsted Acid Co-Catalyzed Allylic C\u2013H Oxidation", "A Pd(II)/bis-sulfoxide/Br\u00f8nsted acid catalyzed allylic C\u2013H oxidation reaction for the synthesis of oxazolidinones from simple N-Boc amines is reported.

Mechanistic studies suggest the role of the phosphoric acid is to furnish a Pd(II)bis-sulfoxide phosphate catalyst that promotes allylic C\u2013H cleavage and \u03c0-allylPd functionalization with a weak, aprotic oxygen nucleophile and to assist in catalyst regeneration."], ["Re-emerging superconductivity at 48 kelvin in iron chalcogenides", "Pressure has an essential role in the production(1) and control(2,3) of superconductivity in iron-based superconductors. Substitution of a large cation by a smaller rare-earth ion to simulate the pressure effect has raised the superconducting transition temperature T-c to a record high of 55 K in these materials(4,5). In the same way as T-c exhibits a bell-shaped curve of dependence on chemical doping, pressure-tuned T-c typically drops monotonically after passing the optimal pressure(1-3). Here we report that in the superconducting iron chalcogenides, a second superconducting phase suddenly re-emerges above 11.5 GPa, after the T-c drops from the first maximum of 32 K at 1 GPa. The T-c of the re-emerging superconducting phase is considerably higher than the first maximum, reaching 48.0-48.7 K for Tl0.6Rb0.4Fe1.67Se2, K0.8Fe1.7Se2 and K0.8Fe1.78Se2."], ["Artemisinins target the SERCA of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>", "Artemisinins are extracted from sweet wormwood (Artemisia annua) and are the most potent antimalarials available(1), rapidly killing all asexual stages of Plasmodium falciparum(2). Artemisinins are sesquiterpene lactones widely used to treat multidrug-resistant malaria(1), a disease that annually claims 1 million lives. Despite extensive clinical and laboratory experience(3-5) their molecular target is not yet identified. Activated artemisinins form adducts with a variety of biological macromolecules, including haem, translationally controlled tumour protein (TCTP) and other higher-molecular-weight proteins(6). Here we show that artemisinins, but not quinine or chloroquine, inhibit the SERCA orthologue (PfATP6) of Plasmodium falciparum in Xenopus oocytes with similar potency to thapsigargin (another sesquiterpene lactone and highly specific SERCA inhibitor). As predicted, thapsigargin also antagonizes the parasiticidal activity of artemisinin. Desoxyartemisinin lacks an endoperoxide bridge and is ineffective both as an inhibitor of PfATP6 and as an antimalarial. Chelation of iron by desferrioxamine abrogates the antiparasitic activity of artemisinins and correspondingly attenuates inhibition of PfATP6. Imaging of parasites with BODIPY-thapsigargin labels the cytosolic compartment and is competed by artemisinin. Fluorescent artemisinin labels parasites similarly and irreversibly in an Fe2+-dependent manner. These data provide compelling evidence that artemisinins act by inhibiting PfATP6 outside the food vacuole after activation by iron."], ["Changing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration was the primary driver of early Cenozoic climate", "The Early Eocene Climate Optimum (EECO, which occurred about 51 to 53 million years ago)(1), was the warmest interval of the past 65 million years, with mean annual surface air temperature over ten degrees Celsius warmer than during the pre-industrial period(2-4). Subsequent global cooling in the middle and late Eocene epoch, especially at high latitudes, eventually led to continental ice sheet development in Antarctica in the early Oligocene epoch (about 33.6 million years ago). However, existing estimates place atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels during the Eocene at 500-3,000 parts per million(5-7), and in the absence of tighter constraints carbon-climate interactions over this interval remain uncertain. Here we use recent analytical and methodological developments(8-11) to generate a new high-fidelity record of CO2 concentrations using the boron isotope (delta B-11) composition of well preserved planktonic foraminifera from the Tanzania Drilling Project, revising previous estimates(6). Although species-level uncertainties make absolute values difficult to constrain, CO2 concentrations during the EECO were around 1,400 parts per million. The relative decline in CO2 concentration through the Eocene is more robustly constrained at about fifty per cent, with a further decline into the Oligocene(12). Provided the latitudinal dependency of sea surface temperature change for a given climate forcing in the Eocene was similar to that of the late Quaternary period(13), this CO2 decline was sufficient to drive the well documented high-and low-latitude cooling that occurred through the Eocene(14). Once the change in global temperature between the pre-industrial period and the Eocene caused by the action of all known slow feedbacks (apart from those associated with the carbon cycle) is removed(2-4), both the EECO and the late Eocene exhibit an equilibrium climate sensitivity relative to the pre-industrial period of 2.1 to 4.6 degrees Celsius per CO2 doubling (66 per cent confidence), which is similar to the canonical range (1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius(15)), indicating that a large fraction of the warmth of the early Eocene greenhouse was driven by increased CO2 concentrations, and that climate sensitivity was relatively constant throughout this period."], ["Additive manufacturing of silica aerogels", "Owing to their ultralow thermal conductivity and open pore structure(1-3), silica aerogels are widely used in thermal insulation(4,5), catalysis(6), physics(7,8), environmental remediation(6,9), optical devices(10) and hypervelocity particle capture(11). Thermal insulation is by far the largest market for silica aerogels, which are ideal materials when space is limited. One drawback of silica aerogels is their brittleness. Fibre reinforcement and binders can be used to overcome this for large-volume applications in building and industrial insulation(5,12), but their poor machinability, combined with the difficulty of precisely casting small objects, limits the miniaturization potential of silica aerogels. Additive manufacturing provides an alternative route to miniaturization, but was \"considered not feasible for silica aerogel\"(13). Here we present a direct ink writing protocol to create miniaturized silica aerogel objects from a slurry of silica aerogel powder in a dilute silica nanoparticle suspension (sol). The inks exhibit shear-thinning behaviour, owing to the high volume fraction of gel particles. As a result, they flow easily through the nozzle during printing, but their viscosity increases rapidly after printing, ensuring that the printed objects retain their shape. After printing, the silica sol is gelled in an ammonia atmosphere to enable subsequent processing into aerogels. The printed aerogel objects are pure silica and retain the high specific surface area (751 square metres per gram) and ultralow thermal conductivity (15.9 milliwatts per metre per kelvin) typical of silica aerogels. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ease with which functional nanoparticles can be incorporated. The printed silica aerogel objects can be used for thermal management, as miniaturized gas pumps and to degrade volatile organic compounds, illustrating the potential of our protocol."], ["All-perovskite tandem solar cells with improved grain surface passivation", "All-perovskite tandem solar cells hold the promise of surpassing the efficiency limits of single-junction solar cells(1-3); however, until now, the best-performing all-perovskite tandem solar cells have exhibited lower certified efficiency than have single-junction perovskite solar cells(4,5). A thick mixed Pb-Sn narrow-bandgap subcell is needed to achieve high photocurrent density in tandem solar cells(6), yet this is challenging owing to the short carrier diffusion length within Pb-Sn perovskites. Here we develop ammonium-cation-passivated Pb-Sn perovskites with long diffusion lengths, enabling subcells that have an absorber thickness of approximately 1.2 mu m. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that widely used phenethylammonium cations are only partially adsorbed on the surface defective sites at perovskite crystallization temperatures. The passivator adsorption is predicted to be enhanced using 4-trifluoromethyl-phenylammonium (CF3-PA), which exhibits a stronger perovskite surface-passivator interaction than does phenethylammonium. By adding a small amount of CF3-PA into the precursor solution, we increase the carrier diffusion length within Pb-Sn perovskites twofold, to over 5 mu m, and increase the efficiency of Pb-Sn perovskite solar cells to over 22%. We report a certified efficiency of 26.4% in all-perovskite tandem solar cells, which exceeds that of the best-performing single-junction perovskite solar cells. Encapsulated tandem devices retain more than 90% of their initial performance after 600 h of operation at the maximum power point under 1 Sun illumination in ambient conditions.

Great improvements in device performance over the past few years, thanks to the development of fabrication protocols(1-3), chemical compositions(4,5) and phase stabilization methods(6-10), have made PSCs one of the most efficient and low-cost solution-processable photovoltaic technologies. However, the light-harvesting performance of these devices is still limited by excessive charge carrier recombination. Despite much effort, the performance of the best-performing PSCs is capped by relatively low fill factors and high open-circuit voltage deficits (the radiative open-circuit voltage limit minus the high open-circuit voltage)(11). Improvements in charge carrier management, which is closely tied to the fill factor and the open-circuit voltage, thus provide a path towards increasing the device performance of PSCs, and reaching their theoretical efficiency limit(12). Here we report a holistic approach to improving the performance of PSCs through enhanced charge carrier management. First, we develop an electron transport layer with an ideal film coverage, thickness and composition by tuning the chemical bath deposition of tin dioxide (SnO2). Second, we decouple the passivation strategy between the bulk and the interface, leading to improved properties, while minimizing the bandgap penalty. In forward bias, our devices exhibit an electroluminescence external quantum efficiency of up to 17.2 per cent and an electroluminescence energy conversion efficiency of up to 21.6 per cent. As solar cells, they achieve a certified power conversion efficiency of 25.2 per cent, corresponding to 80.5 per cent of the thermodynamic limit of its bandgap. An improved device design for perovskite-based photovoltaic cells enables a certified power conversion efficiency of 25.2 per cent, translating to 80.5 per cent of the thermodynamic limit for its bandgap, which approaches those achieved by silicon solar cells."], ["Chemically Modified Electrodes. Advances in Electrochemical Science and Engineering, Vol. 11", "The field of chemically modified electrodes has been continuously growing since its establishment approximately three decades ago. This book covers an eclectic set of topics ranging from already classical systems, such as polyelectrolyte-modified electrodes (Chapter 2) and self-assembled monolayers of thiols on gold electrodes (Chapter 5), to relatively recent electrode systems based on nanomaterials. The latter include nanostructured electrodes (Chapter 1), electrodes based on carbon nanotubes (Chapter 3), and surface-attached electroactive nanoparticles (Chapter 4). There is a degree of thematic overlap between Chapters 1 and 3. \nThe range of topics presented in the book is impressive. It includes the interfacing of electrodes with proteins, electrical communication through molecular wires, electrode surfaces with switchable properties, advanced surface patterning, theory and practice of redox polyelectrolyte films, structure and properties of carbon nanotubes and carbon nanotube-based electrodes, faradaic electroactivity of nanoparticles, electrodeposition of metal on self-assembled monolayers, layer-by-layer assembly, amperometric biosensors, immunosensors, DNA sensors, electrochromic devices, electrochemical actuators, and energy-harvesting devices. The latest developments in these areas are nicely presented in the context of older literature. The references are generally thorough\u2014although, perhaps unavoidably, there are some noticeable omissions as mentioned below\u2014and cover the literature up to 2008. The book keeps a satisfying balance between analytical and physical chemistry aspects of the modified electrodes. \nIn addition to the exciting topics covered in this book, there have also been other important developments in this field recently that are not covered here, such as advances in electrodeposition of inorganic films for detection of biomolecules, chitosan-enzyme-based biosensors, molecularly imprinted film electrodes, and multicomponent modified electrodes that display synergistic analytical effects. The reader should also be advised to exercise a degree of caution when reading some of the literature reports on the direct interfacing of electrodes with enzymes. In particular, the claims that the direct electron transfer between the unoriented mats of carbon nanotubes and glucose oxidase provides the basis for mediatorless detection of glucose are not sufficiently supported by relevant control experiments.

MYC is a transcription factor, and many of its protumorigenic functions have been attributed to its ability to regulate gene expression programs(1-3). Notably, oncogenic MYC activation has also been shown to increase total RNA and protein production in many tissue and disease contexts(4-7). While such increases in RNA and protein production may endow cancer cells with pro-tumour hallmarks, this increase in synthesis may also generate new or heightened burden on MYC-driven cancer cells to process these macromolecules properly(8). Here we discover that the spliceosome is a new target of oncogenic stress in MYC-driven cancers. We identify BUD31 as a MYC-synthetic lethal gene in human mammary epithelial cells, and demonstrate that BUD31 is a component of the core spliceosome required for its assembly and catalytic activity. Core spliceosomal factors (such as SF3B1 and U2AF1) associated with BUD31 are also required to tolerate oncogenic MYC. Notably, MYC hyperactivation induces an increase in total precursor messenger RNA synthesis, suggesting an increased burden on the core spliceosome to process pre-mRNA. In contrast to normal cells, partial inhibition of the spliceosome in MYC-hyperactivated cells leads to global intron retention, widespread defects in pre-mRNA maturation, and deregulation of many essential cell processes. Notably, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of the spliceosome in vivo impairs survival, tumorigenicity and metastatic proclivity of MYC-dependent breast cancers. Collectively, these data suggest that oncogenic MYC confers a collateral stress on splicing, and that components of the spliceosome may be therapeutic entry points for aggressive MYC-driven cancers."], ["Continuous-wave lasing in colloidal quantum dot solids enabled by facet-selective epitaxy", "Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) feature a low degeneracy of electronic states at the band edges compared with the corresponding bulk material(1), as well as a narrow emission linewidth(2,3). Unfortunately for potential laser applications, this degeneracy is incompletely lifted in the valence band, spreading the hole population among several states at room temperature(4-6). This leads to increased optical gain thresholds, demanding high photoexcitation levels to achieve population inversion (more electrons in excited states than in ground states-the condition for optical gain). This, in turn, increases Auger recombination losses(7), limiting the gain lifetime to sub-nanoseconds and preventing steady laser action(8,9). State degeneracy also broadens the photoluminescence linewidth at the single-particle level(10). Here we demonstrate a way to decrease the band-edge degeneracy and single-dot photoluminescence linewidth in CQDs by means of uniform biaxial strain. We have developed a synthetic strategy that we term facet-selective epitaxy: we first switch off, and then switch on, shell growth on the (0001) facet of wurtzite CdSe cores, producing asymmetric compressive shells that create built-in biaxial strain, while still maintaining excellent surface passivation (preventing defect formation, which otherwise would cause non-radiative recombination losses). Our synthesis spreads the excitonic fine structure uniformly and sufficiently broadly that it prevents valence-band-edge states from being thermally depopulated. We thereby reduce the optical gain threshold and demonstrate continuous-wave lasing from CQD solids, expanding the library of solution-processed materials(11,12) that may be capable of continuous-wave lasing. The individual CQDs exhibit an ultranarrow single-dot linewidth, and we successfully propagate this into the ensemble of CQDs."], ["Massive Dirac fermions in a ferromagnetic kagome metal", "The kagome lattice is a two-dimensional network of corner-sharing triangles(1) that is known to host exotic quantum magnetic states(2-4). Theoretical work has predicted that kagome lattices may also host Dirac electronic states(5) that could lead to topological(6) and Chern(7) insulating phases, but these states have so far not been detected in experiments. Here we study the d-electron kagome metal Fe3Sn2, which is designed to support bulk massive Dirac fermions in the presence of ferromagnetic order. We observe a temperature-independent intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity that persists above room temperature, which is suggestive of prominent Berry curvature from the time-reversal-symmetry-breaking electronic bands of the kagome plane. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we observe a pair of quasi-two-dimensional Dirac cones near the Fermi level with a mass gap of 30 millielectronvolts, which correspond to massive Dirac fermions that generate Berry-curvature-induced Hall conductivity. We show that this behaviour is a consequence of the underlying symmetry properties of the bilayer kagome lattice in the ferromagnetic state and the atomic spin-orbit coupling. This work provides evidence for a ferromagnetic kagome metal and an example of emergent topological electronic properties in a correlated electron system. Our results provide insight into the recent discoveries of exotic electronic behaviour in kagome-lattice antiferromagnets(8-10) and may enable lattice-model realizations of fractional topological quantum states(11,12)."], ["Self-assembly of hydrogen-bonded two-dimensional quasicrystals", "The process of molecular self-assembly on solid surfaces is essentially one of crystallization in two dimensions, and the structures that result depend on the interplay between intermolecular forces and the interaction between adsorbates and the underlying substrate(1). Because a single hydrogen bond typically has an energy between 15 and 35 kilojoules per mole, hydrogen bonding can be a strong driver of molecular assembly; this is apparent from the dominant role of hydrogen bonding in nucleic-acid base pairing, as well as in the secondary structure of proteins. Carboxylic acid functional groups, which provide two hydrogen bonds, are particularly promising and reliable in creating and maintaining surface order, and self-assembled monolayers of benzoic acids produce structure that depends on the number and relative placement of carboxylic acid groups(2-6). Here we use scanning tunnelling microscopy to study self-assembled monolayers of ferrocenecarboxylic acid (FcCOOH), and find that, rather than producing dimeric or linear structures typical of carboxylic acids, FcCOOH forms highly unusual cyclic hydrogen-bonded pentamers, which combine with simultaneously formed FcCOOH dimers to form two-dimensional quasicrystallites that exhibit local five-fold symmetry and maintain translational and rotational order (without periodicity) for distances of more than 400 angstroms."], ["An aluminium nitride light-emitting diode with a wavelength of 210 nanometres", "Compact high-efficiency ultraviolet solid-state light sources(1) such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and laser diodes - are of considerable technological interest as alternatives to large, toxic, low-efficiency gas lasers and mercury lamps. Microelectronic fabrication technologies and the environmental sciences both require light sources with shorter emission wavelengths: the former for improved resolution in photolithography and the latter for sensors that can detect minute hazardous particles. In addition, ultraviolet solid-state light sources are also attracting attention for potential applications in high-density optical data storage, biomedical research, water and air purification, and sterilization. Wide-bandgap materials, such as diamond(2) and III - V nitride semiconductors (GaN, AlGaN and AlN; refs 3 - 10), are potential materials for ultraviolet LEDs and laser diodes, but suffer from difficulties in controlling electrical conduction. Here we report the successful control of both n-type and p-type doping in aluminium nitride ( AlN), which has a very wide direct bandgap(11) of 6 eV. This doping strategy allows us to develop an AlN PIN (p-type/intrinsic/n-type) homojunction LED with an emission wavelength of 210 nm, which is the shortest reported to date for any kind of LED. The emission is attributed to an exciton transition, and represents an important step towards achieving exciton-related light-emitting devices as well as replacing gas light sources with solid-state light sources."], ["Control of crystal phase switching and orientation by soluble mollusc-shell proteins", "IN the initial stages of the biomineralization of abalone shells, a primer layer of oriented calcite crystals grows on a nucleating protein sheet(1,2), The deposition of this primer is followed by an abrupt transition to c-axis-oriented crystals of aragonite, another crystalline form of calcium carbonate, The formation of each of the two crystal types is accompanied by the synthesis of specific polyanionic proteins(1-3), suggesting that cooperative interactions between these proteins and the inorganic ions during crystal nucleation and growth control the phase of the deposited mineral and that differential expression of the proteins allo,rs the organism to induce phase changes, It is known that soluble shell proteins can control crystal morphology(4-10), but it has been suspected that the switch in phase-from calcite to aragonite-might require the deposition of a new nucleating protein sheet. Here we describe in vitro studies of the crystallization of calcium carbonate in the presence of soluble polyanionic proteins extracted from abalone shell, We find that these proteins alone are sufficient to control the crystal phase, allowing us to switch abruptly and sequentially between aragonite and calcite without the need for deposition of an intervening protein sheet. These results show that soluble organic components can exert greater control over hierarchical biomineral growth than hitherto suspected, offering the prospect of similar phase control in materials chemistry."], ["DESIGN AND SYNTHESIS OF AN ULTRAVIOLET-TRANSPARENT NONLINEAR-OPTICAL CRYSTAL SR2BE2B2O7", "POWERFUL, tunable ultraviolet laser sources, required for many spectroscopic applications, rely on the frequency-doubling of lasers in the visible range. Such second-harmonic generation (SHG) depends on the development of nonlinear optical (NLO) materials with high SHG coefficients, a wide transparent region in the ultraviolet, and moderate birefringence. Few such materials are available; those most widely used at present are the inorganic crystals beta-BaB2O4 (BBO)(1) and LiB3O5 (LBO)(2). These crystals are effective for SHG only down to wavelengths of 205 nm (ref. 3), because of a limited ultraviolet-transparent range in the former case and birefringence problems in the latter. We have developed previously(4) a new inorganic NLO crystal, KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF); which avoids both of these problems to a large degree. But it is hard to grow large crystals of KBBF because of weak binding between its layered structural units. We have now developed an improved material by rational design: Sr2Be2B2O7 (SBBO), which shares (and in fact slightly improves on) all of the favourable NLO properties of KBBF and is easy to grow as large (so far up to 7 x 7 x 3 mm) crystals of high optical quality.

Apropos of these goals is a surge of fundamental research targeting heterogeneous materials as electrocatalysts for the nitrogen reduction reaction (N2RR)(2). These systems generally suffer from poor stability and NH3 selectivity; the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) outcompetes N2RR3. Molecular catalyst systems can be exquisitely tuned and offer an alternative strategy(4), but progress has been thwarted by the same selectivity issue; HER dominates. Here we describe a tandem catalysis strategy that offers a solution to this puzzle. A molecular complex that can mediate an N-2 reduction cycle is partnered with a co-catalyst that interfaces the electrode and an acid to mediate proton-coupled electron transfer steps, facilitating N-H bond formation at a favourable applied potential (-1.2 V versus Fc(+/0)) and overall thermodynamic efficiency. Certain intermediates of the N2RR cycle would be otherwise unreactive via uncoupled electron transfer or proton transfer steps. Structurally diverse complexes of several metals (W, Mo, Os, Fe) also mediate N2RR electrocatalysis at the same potential in the presence of the mediator, pointing to the generality of this tandem approach."], ["Label-free immunodetection with CMOS-compatible semiconducting nanowires", "Semiconducting nanowires have the potential to function as highly sensitive and selective sensors for the label-free detection of low concentrations of pathogenic microorganisms(1-10). Successful solution-phase nanowire sensing has been demonstrated for ions(3), small molecules(4), proteins(5,6), DNA(7) and viruses(8); however, 'bottom-up' nanowires ( or similarly configured carbon nanotubes(11)) used for these demonstrations require hybrid fabrication schemes(12,13), which result in severe integration issues that have hindered widespread application. Alternative 'top-down' fabrication methods of nanowire-like devices(9,10,14-17) produce disappointing performance because of process-induced material and device degradation. Here we report an approach that uses complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) field effect transistor compatible technology and hence demonstrate the specific label-free detection of below 100 femtomolar concentrations of antibodies as well as real-time monitoring of the cellular immune response. This approach eliminates the need for hybrid methods and enables system-scale integration of these sensors with signal processing and information systems. Additionally, the ability to monitor antibody binding and sense the cellular immune response in real time with readily available technology should facilitate widespread diagnostic applications."], ["Structure of a modular polyketide synthase", "Polyketide natural products constitute a broad class of compounds with diverse structural features and biological activities. Their biosynthetic machinery, represented by type I polyketide synthases (PKSs), has an architecture in which successive modules catalyse two-carbon linear extensions and keto-group processing reactions on intermediates covalently tethered to carrier domains. Here we used electron cryo-microscopy to determine sub-nanometre-resolution three-dimensional reconstructions of a full-length PKS module from the bacterium Streptomyces venezuelae that revealed an unexpectedly different architecture compared to the homologous dimeric mammalian fatty acid synthase. A single reaction chamber provides access to all catalytic sites for the intramodule carrier domain. In contrast, the carrier from the preceding module uses a separate entrance outside the reaction chamber to deliver the upstream polyketide intermediate for subsequent extension and modification. This study reveals for the first time, to our knowledge, the structural basis for both intramodule and intermodule substrate transfer in polyketide synthases, and establishes a new model for molecular dissection of these multifunctional enzyme systems."], ["Uses of K2S2O8 in Metal-Catalyzed and Metal-Free Oxidative Transformations", "Carbon\u2013carbon/carbon\u2013heteroatom bond formation via oxidative transformations is a heavily explored topic at the frontier of chemistry.

The current review provides a comprehensive coverage of oxidative transformations aided with K2S2O8 in the presence or absence of a transition-metal catalyst, critical assessment of the results, and underlying mechanisms. Organic chemists may find this review to be a useful guide for the expedient synthesis of new chemical entities, to formulate mechanistic manifolds involving the sulfate radical anion, or to design novel oxidative transformations.

The electronic bands of this system were predicted(1,2)to narrow markedly(9,10)near the magic angle, leading to a variety of possible symmetry-breaking ground states(11-17). Here, using measurements of the local electronic compressibility, we show that these correlated phases originate from a high-energy state with an unusual sequence of band population. As carriers are added to the system, the four electronic 'flavours', which correspond to the spin and valley degrees of freedom, are not filled equally. Rather, they are populated through a sequence of sharp phase transitions, which appear as strong asymmetric jumps of the electronic compressibility near integer fillings of the moire lattice. At each transition, a single spin/valley flavour takes all the carriers from its partially filled peers, 'resetting' them to the vicinity of the charge neutrality point. As a result, the Dirac-like character observed near charge neutrality reappears after each integer filling. Measurement of the in-plane magnetic field dependence of the chemical potential near filling factor one reveals a large spontaneous magnetization, further substantiating this picture of a cascade of symmetry breaking. The sequence of phase transitions and Dirac revivals is observed at temperatures well above the onset of the superconducting and correlated insulating states. This indicates that the state that we report here, with its strongly broken electronic flavour symmetry and revived Dirac-like electronic character, is important in the physics of magic-angle graphene, forming the parent state out of which the more fragile superconducting and correlated insulating ground states emerge. Local electronic compressibility measurements of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene show that the insulating and superconducting phases of this system are both derived from a high-energy symmetry-broken state."], ["An antiaromatic-walled nanospace", "Over the past few decades, several molecular cages, hosts and nanoporous materials enclosing nanometre-sized cavities have been reported(1-5), including coordination-driven nanocages(6). Such nanocages have found widespread use in molecular recognition, separation, stabilization and the promotion of unusual chemical reactions, among other applications(3-10). Most of the reported nanospaces within molecular hosts are confined by aromatic walls, the properties of which help to determine the host-guest behaviour. However, cages with nanospaces surrounded by antiaromatic walls have not yet been developed, owing to the instability of antiaromatic compounds; as such, the effect of antiaromatic walls on the properties of nanospaces remains unknown. Here we demonstrate the construction of an antiaromatic-walled nanospace within a self-assembled cage composed of four metal ions with six identical antiaromatic walls. Calculations indicate that the magnetic effects of the antiaromatic moieties surrounding this nanospace reinforce each other. This prediction is confirmed by H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals of bound guest molecules, which are observed at chemical shift values of up to 24 parts per million (ppm), owing to the combined antiaromatic deshielding effect of the surrounding rings. This value, shifted 15 ppm from that of the free guest, is the largest 1H NMR chemical shift displacement resulting from an antiaromatic environment observed so far. This cage may thus be considered as a type of NMR shift reagent, moving guest signals well beyond the usual NMR frequency range and opening the way to further probing the effects of an antiaromatic environment on a nanospace."], ["The nonlinear nature of friction", "Tribology Is the study of adhesion, friction, lubrication and wear of surfaces in relative motion. It remains as important today as it was in ancient times, arising in the fields of physics, chemistry, geology, biology and engineering. The more we learn about tribology the more complex it appears. Nevertheless, recent experiments coupled to theoretical modelling have made great advances in unifying apparently diverse phenomena and revealed many subtle and often non-intuitive aspects of matter in motion, which stem from the nonlinear nature of the problem."], ["Photochemically produced SO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere of WASP-39b", "Photochemistry is a fundamental process of planetary atmospheres that regulates the atmospheric composition and stability(1). However, no unambiguous photochemical products have been detected in exoplanet atmospheres so far. Recent observations from the JWST Transiting Exoplanet Community Early Release Science Program(2,3) found a spectral absorption feature at 4.05 mu m arising from sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the atmosphere of WASP-39b. WASP-39b is a 1.27-Jupiter-radii, Saturn-mass (0.28 M-J) gas giant exoplanet orbiting a Sun-like star with an equilibrium temperature of around 1,100 K (ref. (4)). The most plausible way of generating SO2 in such an atmosphere is through photochemical processes(5,6). Here we show that the SO2 distribution computed by a suite of photochemical models robustly explains the 4.05-mu m spectral feature identified by JWST transmission observations(7) with NIRSpec PRISM (2.7s)(8) and G395H (4.5s)(9). SO2 is produced by successive oxidation of sulfur radicals freed when hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is destroyed. The sensitivity of the SO2 feature to the enrichment of the atmosphere by heavy elements (metallicity) suggests that it can be used as a tracer of atmospheric properties, with WASP-39b exhibiting an inferred metallicity of about 10x solar. We further point out that SO2 also shows observable features at ultraviolet and thermal infrared wavelengths not available from the existing observations."], ["Inverted perovskite solar cells using dimethylacridine-based dopants", "Doping of perovskite semiconductors(1) and passivation of their grain boundaries(2) remain challenging but essential for advancing high-efficiency perovskite solar cells.

Here we report a dimethylacridine-based molecular doping process used to construct a well-matched p-perovskite/ITO contact, along with all-round passivation of grain boundaries, achieving a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.39%. The molecules are shown to be extruded from the precursor solution to the grain boundaries and the bottom of the film surface in the chlorobenzene-quenched crystallization process, which we call a molecule-extrusion process. The core coordination complex between the deprotonated phosphonic acid group of the molecule and lead polyiodide of perovskite is responsible for both mechanical absorption and electronic charge transfer, and leads to p-type doping of the perovskite film.

Despite the presence of numerous neoantigens in patients, complete tumour elimination is rare, owing to failures in mounting a sufficient and lasting antitumour immune response(3,4). Here we show that durable neoantigen-specific immunity is regulated by mRNA N-6-methyadenosine (m(6)A) methylation through the m(6)A-binding protein YTHDF1(5). In contrast to wild-type mice, Ythdf1-deficient mice show an elevated antigen-specific CD8(+) T cell antitumour response. Loss of YTHDF1 in classical dendritic cells enhanced the cross-presentation of tumour antigens and the cross-priming of CD8(+) T cells in vivo. Mechanistically, transcripts encoding lysosomal proteases are marked by m(6)A and recognized by YTHDF1. Binding of YTHDF1 to these transcripts increases the translation of lysosomal cathepsins in dendritic cells, and inhibition of cathepsins markedly enhances cross-presentation of wild-type dendritic cells. Furthermore, the therapeutic efficacy of PD-L1 checkpoint blockade is enhanced in Ythdf1(-/-) mice, implicating YTHDF1 as a potential therapeutic target in anticancer immunotherapy."], ["Quantized current steps due to the a.c. coherent quantum phase-slip effect", "The a.c. Josephson effect predicted in 1962(1) and observed experimentally in 1963(2) as quantized 'voltage steps' (the Shapiro steps) from photon-assisted tunnelling of Cooper pairs is among the most fundamental phenomena of quantum mechanics and is vital for metrological quantum voltage standards. The physically dual effect, the a.c. coherent quantum phase slip (CQPS), photon-assisted tunnelling of magnetic fluxes through a superconducting nanowire, is envisaged to reveal itself as quantized 'current steps'(3,4). The basic physical significance of the a.c. CQPS is also complemented by practical importance in future current standards, a missing element for closing the quantum metrology triangle(5,6). In 2012, the CQPS was demonstrated as superposition of magnetic flux quanta in superconducting nanowires (7). However, the direct flat current steps in superconductors, the only unavailable basic effect of superconductivity to date, was unattainable due to lack of appropriate materials and challenges in circuit engineering. Here we report the direct observation of the dual Shapiro steps in a superconducting nanowire. The sharp steps are clear up to 26 GHz frequency with current values 8.3 nA and limited by the present set-up bandwidth.

No existing electrolyte simultaneously meets all these requirements and electrolyte design is hindered by the absence of an effective guiding principle that addresses the relationships between battery performance, solvation structure and solid-electrolyte-interphase chemistry(5). Here we report and validate an electrolyte design strategy based on a group of soft solvents that strikes a balance between weak Li+-solvent interactions, sufficient salt dissociation and desired electrochemistry to fulfil all the aforementioned requirements. Remarkably, the 4.5-volt NMC811||graphite coin cells with areal capacities of more than 2.5 milliampere hours per square centimetre retain 75 per cent (54 per cent) of their room-temperature capacity when these cells are charged and discharged at -50 degrees Celsius (-60 degrees Celsius) at a C rate of 0.1C, and the NMC811||graphite pouch cells with lean electrolyte (2.5 grams per ampere hour) achieve stable cycling with an average Coulombic efficiency of more than 99.9 per cent at -30 degrees Celsius. The comprehensive analysis further reveals an impedance matching between the NMC811 cathode and the graphite anode owing to the formation of similar lithium-fluoride-rich interphases, thus effectively avoiding lithium plating at low temperatures.

But to realize such applications, the charge carrier mobilities of solution-processed organic semiconductors must be improved. For inorganic semiconductors, a general method of increasing charge carrier mobility is to introduce strain within the crystal lattice(6). Here we describe a solution-processing technique for organic semiconductors in which lattice strain is used to increase charge carrier mobilities by introducing greater electron orbital overlap between the component molecules. For organic semiconductors, the spacing between cofacially stacked, conjugated backbones (the pi-pi stacking distance) greatly influences electron orbital overlap and therefore mobility(7). Using our method to incrementally introduce lattice strain, we alter the pi-pi stacking distance of 6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl) pentacene (TIPS-pentacene) from 3.33 angstrom to 3.08 angstrom. We believe that 3.08 angstrom is the shortest pi-pi stacking distance that has been achieved in an organic semiconductor crystal lattice (although a pi-pi distance of 3.04 angstrom has been achieved through intramolecular bonding(8-10)). The positive charge carrier (hole) mobility in TIPS-pentacene transistors increased from 0.8 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) for unstrained films to a high mobility of 4.6 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) for a strained film.

Here we report a wearable ultrasonic device for continuous, real-time and direct cardiac function assessment. We introduce innovations in device design and material fabrication that improve the mechanical coupling between the device and human skin, allowing the left ventricle to be examined from different views during motion. We also develop a deep learning model that automatically extracts the left ventricular volume from the continuous image recording, yielding waveforms of key cardiac performance indices such as stroke volume, cardiac output and ejection fraction.

Using a quantitative scoring system that we call MiST, we identified with high confidence 497 HIV-human protein-protein interactions involving 435 individual human proteins, with similar to 40% of the interactions being identified in both cell types. We found that the host proteins hijacked by HIV, especially those found interacting in both cell types, are highly conserved across primates. We uncovered a number of host complexes targeted by viral proteins, including the finding that HIV protease cleaves eIF3d, a subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3.

In this complex, alpha-klotho simultaneously tethers FGFR1c by its D3 domain and FGF23 by its C-terminal tail, thus implementing FGF23-FGFR1c proximity and conferring stability. Dimerization of the stabilized ternary complexes and receptor activation remain dependent on the binding of heparan sulfate, a mandatory cofactor of paracrine FGF signalling. The structure of alpha-klotho is incompatible with its purported glycosidase activity. Thus, shed alpha-klotho functions as an on-demand non-enzymatic scaffold protein that promotes FGF23 signalling."], ["Semiconducting non-molecular nitrogen up to 240 GPa and its low-pressure stability", "The triple bond of diatomic nitrogen has among the greatest binding energies of any molecule. At low temperatures and pressures, nitrogen forms a molecular crystal in which these strong bonds co-exist with weak van der Waals interactions between molecules, producing an insulator with a large band gap(1). As the pressure is raised on molecular crystals, intermolecular interactions increase and the molecules eventually dissociate to form monoatomic metallic solids, as was first predicted for hydrogen(2). Theory predicts that, in a pressure range between 50 and 94 GPa, diatomic nitrogen can be transformed into a non-molecular framework or polymeric structure with potential use as a high-energy-density material(3-5). Here we show that the non-molecular phase of nitrogen is semiconducting up to at least 240 GPa, at which pressure the energy gap has decreased to 0.4 eV. At 300 K, this transition from insulating to semiconducting behaviour starts at a pressure of approximately 140 GPa, but shifts to much higher pressure with decreasing temperature. The transition also exhibits remarkably large hysteresis with an equilibrium transition estimated to be near 100 GPa. Moreover, we have succeeded in recovering the non-molecular phase of nitrogen at ambient pressure (at temperatures below 100 K), which could be of importance for practical use."], ["Half-metallic graphene nanoribbons", "Electrical current can be completely spin polarized in a class of materials known as half- metals, as a result of the coexistence of metallic nature for electrons with one spin orientation and insulating nature for electrons with the other. Such asymmetric electronic states for the different spins have been predicted for some ferromagnetic metals - for example, the Heusler compounds(1) and were first observed in a manganese perovskite (2). In view of the potential for use of this property in realizing spin- based electronics, substantial efforts have been made to search for half-metallic materials(3,4). However, organic materials have hardly been investigated in this context even though carbon- based nanostructures hold significant promise for future electronic devices (5). Here we predict half- metallicity in nanometre- scale graphene ribbons by using first- principles calculations. We show that this phenomenon is realizable if in- plane homogeneous electric fields are applied across the zigzag- shaped edges of the graphene nanoribbons, and that their magnetic properties can be controlled by the external electric fields. The results are not only of scientific interest in the interplay between electric fields and electronic spin degree of freedom in solids 6,7 but may also open a new path to explore spintronics(3) at the nanometre scale, based on graphene(8 - 11)."], ["Targeting LIF-mediated paracrine interaction for pancreatic cancer therapy and monitoring", "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a dismal prognosis largely owing to inefficient diagnosis and tenacious drug resistance. Activation of pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) and consequent development of dense stroma are prominent features accounting for this aggressive biology(1,2). The reciprocal interplay between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells (PCCs) not only enhances tumour progression and metastasis but also sustains their own activation, facilitating a vicious cycle to exacerbate tumorigenesis and drug resistance(3-7). Furthermore, PSC activation occurs very early during PDAC tumorigenesis(8-10), and activated PSCs comprise a substantial fraction of the tumour mass, providing a rich source of readily detectable factors. Therefore, we hypothesized that the communication between PSCs and PCCs could be an exploitable target to develop effective strategies for PDAC therapy and diagnosis. Here, starting with a systematic proteomic investigation of secreted disease mediators and underlying molecular mechanisms, we reveal that leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a key paracrine factor from activated PSCs acting on cancer cells. Both pharmacologic LIF blockade and genetic Lifr deletion markedly slow tumour progression and augment the efficacy of chemotherapy to prolong survival of PDAC mouse models, mainly by modulating cancer cell differentiation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition status. Moreover, in both mouse models and human PDAC, aberrant production of LIF in the pancreas is restricted to pathological conditions and correlates with PDAC pathogenesis, and changes in the levels of circulating LIF correlate well with tumour response to therapy. Collectively, these findings reveal a function of LIF in PDAC tumorigenesis, and suggest its translational potential as an attractive therapeutic target and circulating marker. Our studies underscore how a better understanding of cell-cell communication within the tumour microenvironment can suggest novel strategies for cancer therapy."], ["Collapse and rapid resumption of Atlantic meridional circulation linked to deglacial climate changes", "The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation is widely believed to affect climate. Changes in ocean circulation have been inferred from records of the deep water chemical composition derived from sedimentary nutrient proxies(1), but their impact on climate is difficult to assess because such reconstructions provide insufficient constraints on the rate of overturning(2). Here we report measurements of Pa-231/(230) Th, a kinematic proxy for the meridional overturning circulation, in a sediment core from the subtropical North Atlantic Ocean. We find that the meridional overturning was nearly, or completely, eliminated during the coldest deglacial interval in the North Atlantic region, beginning with the catastrophic iceberg discharge Heinrich event H1, 17,500 yr ago, and declined sharply but briefly into the Younger Dryas cold event, about 12,700 yr ago. Following these cold events, the Pa-231/(230) Th record indicates that rapid accelerations of the meridional overturning circulation were concurrent with the two strongest regional warming events during deglaciation. These results confirm the significance of variations in the rate of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation for abrupt climate changes."], ["Bone-marrow adipocytes as negative regulators of the haematopoietic microenvironment", "Osteoblasts and endothelium constitute functional niches that support haematopoietic stem cells in mammalian bone marrow(1-3). Adult bone marrow also contains adipocytes, the number of which correlates inversely with the haematopoietic activity of the marrow. Fatty infiltration of haematopoietic red marrow follows irradiation or chemotherapy and is a diagnostic feature in biopsies from patients with marrow aplasia(4). To explore whether adipocytes influence haematopoiesis or simply fill marrow space, we compared the haematopoietic activity of distinct regions of the mouse skeleton that differ in adiposity. Here we show, by flow cytometry, colony-forming activity and competitive repopulation assay, that haematopoietic stem cells and short-term progenitors are reduced in frequency in the adipocyte-rich vertebrae of the mouse tail relative to the adipocyte-free vertebrae of the thorax. In lipoatrophic A-ZIP/F1 'fatless' mice, which are genetically incapable of forming adipocytes(5), and in mice treated with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-c inhibitor bisphenol A diglycidyl ether, which inhibits adipogenesis(6), marrow engraftment after irradiation is accelerated relative to wild-type or untreated mice. These data implicate adipocytes as predominantly negative regulators of the bone-marrow microenvironment, and indicate that antagonizing marrow adipogenesis may enhance haematopoietic recovery in clinical bone-marrow transplantation."], ["Structural insights into Ubr1-mediated N-degron polyubiquitination", "The N-degron pathway targets proteins that bear a destabilizing residue at the N terminus for proteasome-dependent degradation(1). In yeast, Ubr1-a single-subunit E3 ligase-is responsible for the Arg/N-degron pathway(2). How Ubr1 mediates the initiation of ubiquitination and the elongation of the ubiquitin chain in a linkage-specific manner through a single E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (Ubc2) remains unknown. Here we developed chemical strategies to mimic the reaction intermediates of the first and second ubiquitin transfer steps, and determined the cryo-electron microscopy structures of Ubr1 in complex with Ubc2, ubiquitin and two N-degron peptides, representing the initiation and elongation steps of ubiquitination. Key structural elements, including a Ubc2-binding region and an acceptor ubiquitin-binding loop on Ubr1, were identified and characterized. These structures provide mechanistic insights into the initiation and elongation of ubiquitination catalysed by Ubr1."], ["Structural basis of RNA recognition and activation by innate immune receptor RIG-I", "Retinoic-acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I; also known as DDX58) is a cytoplasmic pathogen recognition receptor that recognizes pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) motifs to differentiate between viral and cellular RNAs. RIG-I is activated by blunt-ended double-stranded (ds)RNA with or without a 5'-triphosphate (ppp), by single-stranded RNA marked by a 5'-ppp(1) and by polyuridine sequences(2,3). Upon binding to such PAMP motifs, RIG-I initiates a signalling cascade that induces innate immune defences and inflammatory cytokines to establish an antiviral state. The RIG-I pathway is highly regulated and aberrant signalling leads to apoptosis, altered cell differentiation, inflammation, autoimmune diseases and cancer(4,5). The helicase and repressor domains (RD) of RIG-I recognize dsRNA and 5'-ppp RNA to activate the two amino-terminal caspase recruitment domains (CARDs) for signalling. Here, to understand the synergy between the helicase and the RD for RNA binding, and the contribution of ATP hydrolysis to RIG-I activation, we determined the structure of human RIG-I helicase-RD in complex with dsRNA and an ATP analogue. The helicase-RD organizes into a ring around dsRNA, capping one end, while contacting both strands using previously uncharacterized motifs to recognize dsRNA. Small-angle X-ray scattering, limited proteolysis and differential scanning fluorimetry indicate that RIG-I is in an extended and flexible conformation that compacts upon binding RNA. These results provide a detailed view of the role of helicase in dsRNA recognition, the synergy between the RD and the helicase for RNA binding and the organization of full-length RIG-I bound to dsRNA, and provide evidence of a conformational change upon RNA binding. The RIG-I helicase-RD structure is consistent with dsRNA translocation without unwinding and cooperative binding to RNA. The structure yields unprecedented insight into innate immunity and has a broader impact on other areas of biology, including RNA interference and DNA repair, which utilize homologous helicase domains within DICER and FANCM."], ["Structural basis of abscisic acid signalling", "The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) mediates the adaptation of plants to environmental stresses such as drought and regulates developmental signals such as seed maturation. Within plants, the PYR/PYL/RCAR family of START proteins receives ABA to inhibit the phosphatase activity of the group-A protein phosphatases 2C (PP2Cs), which are major negative regulators in ABA signalling. Here we present the crystal structures of the ABA receptor PYL1 bound with (+)-ABA, and the complex formed by the further binding of (+)-ABA-bound PYL1 with the PP2C protein ABI1. PYL1 binds (+)-ABA using the START-protein-specific ligand-binding site, thereby forming a hydrophobic pocket on the surface of the closed lid. (+)-ABA-bound PYL1 tightly interacts with a PP2C domain of ABI1 by using the hydrophobic pocket to cover the active site of ABI1 like a plug. Our results reveal the structural basis of the mechanism of (+)-ABA-dependent inhibition of ABI1 by PYL1 in ABA signalling."], ["Formation of a Supramolecular Polymeric Adhesive via Water-Participant Hydrogen Bond Formation", "A supramolecular polymeric adhesive was prepared from non-viscous, non-polymeric materials by water\u2013participant hydrogen bonds. Pt\u2013pyridine coordination and water\u2013crown ether hydrogen bonding combine to effect the supramolecular polymerization. The supramolecular polymeric adhesive displays strong, reversible adhesion to hydrophilic surfaces, a property that forecasts the application of hydrogen bonding in advanced supramolecular materials."], ["Three-dimensional printing of hierarchical liquid-crystal-polymer structures", "Fibre-reinforced polymer structures are often used when stiff lightweight materials are required, such as in aircraft, vehicles and biomedical implants. Despite their very high stiffness and strength(1), such lightweight materials require energy- and labour-intensive fabrication processes(2), exhibit typically brittle fracture and are difficult to shape and recycle(3,4). This is in stark contrast to lightweight biological materials such as bone, silk and wood, which form by directed self-assembly into complex, hierarchically structured shapes with outstanding mechanical properties(5-11), and are circularly integrated into the environment. Here we demonstrate a three-dimensional (3D) printing approach to generate recyclable lightweight structures with hierarchical architectures, complex geometries and unprecedented stiffness and toughness. Their features arise from the self-assembly of liquid-crystal polymer molecules into highly oriented domains during extrusion of the molten feedstock material. By orienting the molecular domains with the print path, we are able to reinforce the polymer structure according to the expected mechanical stresses, leading to stiffness, strength and toughness that outperform state-of-the-art 3D-printed polymers by an order of magnitude and are comparable with the highest-performance lightweight composites(1,12). The ability to combine the top-down shaping freedom of 3D printing with bottom-up molecular control over polymer orientation opens up the possibility to freely design and realize structures without the typical restrictions of current manufacturing processes."], ["A revolution in optical manipulation", "Optical tweezers use the forces exerted by a strongly focused beam of light to trap and move objects ranging in size from tens of nanometres to tens of micrometres. Since their introduction in 1986, the optical tweezer has become an important tool for research in the fields of biology, physical chemistry and soft condensed matter physics. Recent advances promise to take optical tweezers out of the laboratory and into the mainstream of manufacturing and diagnostics; they may even become consumer products. The next generation of single-beam optical traps offers revolutionary new opportunities for fundamental and applied research."], ["Structure of the complex I-like molecule NDH of oxygenic photosynthesis", "Cyclic electron flow around photosystem I (PSI) is a mechanism by which photosynthetic organisms balance the levels of ATP and NADPH necessary for efficient photosynthesis(1,2). NAD(P)H dehydrogenase-like complex (NDH) is a key component of this pathway in most oxygenic photosynthetic organisms(3,4) and is the last large photosynthetic membrane-protein complex for which the structure remains unknown. Related to the respiratory NADH dehydrogenase complex (complex I), NDH transfers electrons originating from PSI to the plastoquinone pool while pumping protons across the thylakoid membrane, thereby increasing the amount of ATP produced per NADP+ molecule reduced(4,5). NDH possesses 11 of the 14 core complex I subunits, as well as several oxygenic-photosynthesis-specific (OPS) subunits that are conserved from cyanobacteria to plants(3,6). However, the three core complex I subunits that are involved in accepting electrons from NAD(P) H are notably absent in NDH3,5,6, and it is therefore not clear how NDH acquires and transfers electrons to plastoquinone. It is proposed that the OPS subunits-specifically NdhS-enable NDH to accept electrons from its electron donor, ferredoxin(3-5,7). Here we report a 3.1 angstrom structure of the 0.42-MDa NDH complex from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1, obtained by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. Our maps reveal the structure and arrangement of the principal OPS subunits in the NDH complex, as well as an unexpected cofactor close to the plastoquinone-binding site in the peripheral arm. The location of the OPS subunits supports a role in electron transfer and defines two potential ferredoxin-binding sites at the apex of the peripheral arm. These results suggest that NDH could possess several electron transfer routes, which would serve to maximize plastoquinone reduction and avoid deleterious off-target chemistry of the semi-plastoquinone radical."], ["Eutrophication causes speciation reversal in whitefish adaptive radiations", "Species diversity can be lost through two different but potentially interacting extinction processes: demographic decline and speciation reversal through introgressive hybridization. To investigate the relative contribution of these processes, we analysed historical and contemporary data of replicate whitefish radiations from 17 pre-alpine European lakes and reconstructed changes in genetic species differentiation through time using historical samples. Here we provide evidence that species diversity evolved in response to ecological opportunity, and that eutrophication, by diminishing this opportunity, has driven extinctions through speciation reversal and demographic decline. Across the radiations, the magnitude of eutrophication explains the pattern of species loss and levels of genetic and functional distinctiveness among remaining species. We argue that extinction by speciation reversal may be more widespread than currently appreciated. Preventing such extinctions will require that conservation efforts not only target existing species but identify and protect the ecological and evolutionary processes that generate and maintain species."], ["Genome-wide association study identifies 74 loci associated with educational attainment", "Educational attainment is strongly influenced by social and other environmental factors, but genetic factors are estimated to account for at least 20% of the variation across individuals(1). Here we report the results of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for educational attainment that extends our earlier discovery sample(1,2) of 101,069 individuals to 293,723 individuals, and a replication study in an independent sample of 111,349 individuals from the UK Biobank. We identify 74 genome-wide significant loci associated with the number of years of schooling completed. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with educational attainment are disproportionately found in genomic regions regulating gene expression in the fetal brain. Candidate genes are preferentially expressed in neural tissue, especially during the prenatal period, and enriched for biological pathways involved in neural development. Our findings demonstrate that, even for a behavioural phenotype that is mostly environmentally determined, a well-powered GWAS identifies replicable associated genetic variants that suggest biologically relevant pathways. Because educational attainment is measured in large numbers of individuals, it will continue to be useful as a proxy phenotype in efforts to characterize the genetic influences of related phenotypes, including cognition and neuropsychiatric diseases."], ["Superconductivity in an infinite-layer nickelate", "The discovery of unconventional superconductivity in (La,Ba)(2)CuO4 (ref.(1)) has motivated the study of compounds with similar crystal and electronic structure, with the aim of finding additional superconductors and understanding the origins of copper oxide superconductivity. Isostructural examples include bulk superconducting Sr2RuO4 (ref.(2)) and surface-electron-doped Sr2IrO4, which exhibits spectroscopic signatures consistent with a superconducting gap(3,4), although a zero-resistance state has not yet been observed. This approach has also led to the theoretical investigation of nickelates(5,6), as well as thin-film heterostructures designed to host superconductivity. One such structure is the LaAlO3/LaNiO3 superlattice(7-9), which has been recently proposed for the creation of an artificially layered nickelate heterostructure with a singly occupied d(x2-y2) band. The absence of superconductivity observed in previous related experiments has been attributed, at least in part, to incomplete polarization of the e(g) orbitals(10). Here we report the observation of superconductivity in an infinite-layer nickelate that is isostructural to infinite-layer copper oxides(11-13). Using soft-chemistry topotactic reduction(14-20), NdNiO2 and Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2 single-crystal thin films are synthesized by reducing the perovskite precursor phase. Whereas NdNiO2 exhibits a resistive upturn at low temperature, measurements of the resistivity, critical current density and magnetic-field response of Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2 indicate a superconducting transition temperature of about 9 to 15 kelvin. Because this compound is a member of a series of reduced layered nickelate crystal structures(21-23), these results suggest the possibility of a family of nickelate superconductors analogous to copper oxides(24) and pnictides(25)."], ["Defining the core <i>Arabidopsis</i> thaliana root microbiome", "Land plants associate with a root microbiota distinct from the complex microbial community present in surrounding soil. The microbiota colonizing the rhizosphere (immediately surroundingthe root) and the endophytic compartment (within the root) contribute to plant growth, productivity, carbon sequestration and phytoremediation(1-3). Colonization of the root occurs despite a sophisticated plant immune system(4,5), suggesting finely tuned discrimination of mutualists and commensals from pathogens. Genetic principles governing the derivation of host-specific endophyte communities from soil communities are poorly understood. Here we report the pyrosequencing of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene of more than 600 Arabidopsis thaliana plants to test the hypotheses that the root rhizosphere and endophytic compartmentmicrobiota of plants grown under controlled conditions in natural soils are sufficiently dependent on the host to remain consistent across different soil types and developmental stages, and sufficiently dependent on host genotype to vary between inbred Arabidopsis accessions. We describe different bacterial communities in two geochemically distinct bulk soils and in rhizosphere and endophytic compartments prepared from roots grown in these soils. The communities in each compartment are strongly influenced by soil type. Endophytic compartments fromboth soils feature overlapping, low-complexity communities that are markedly enriched in Actinobacteria and specific families from other phyla, notably Proteobacteria. Some bacteria vary quantitatively between plants of different developmental stage and genotype. Our rigorous definition of an endophytic compartment microbiome should facilitate controlled dissection of plantmicrobe interactions derived from complex soil communities."], ["Ligand-accelerated enantioselective methylene C(sp3)\u2013H bond activation", "Effective differentiation of prochiral carbon\u2013hydrogen (C\u2013H) bonds on a single methylene carbon via asymmetric metal insertion remains a challenge. Here, we report the discovery of chiral acetyl-protected aminoethyl quinoline ligands that enable asymmetric palladium insertion into prochiral C\u2013H bonds on a single methylene carbon center. We apply these palladium complexes to catalytic enantioselective functionalization of \u03b2-methylene C\u2013H bonds in aliphatic amides. Using bidentate ligands to accelerate C\u2013H activation of otherwise unreactive monodentate substrates is crucial for outcompeting the background reaction driven by substrate-directed cyclopalladation, thereby avoiding erosion of enantioselectivity. The potential of ligand acceleration in C\u2013H activation is also demonstrated by enantioselective \u03b2-C\u2013H arylation of simple carboxylic acids without installing directing groups."], ["Directed evolution of artificial metalloenzymes for <i>in vivo</i> metathesis", "The field of biocatalysis has advanced from harnessing natural enzymes to using directed evolution to obtain new biocatalysts with tailor-made functions(1). Several tools have recently been developed to expand the natural enzymatic repertoire with abiotic reactions(2,3). For example, artificial metalloenzymes, which combine the versatile reaction scope of transition metals with the beneficial catalytic features of enzymes, offer an attractive means to engineer new reactions. Three complementary strategies exist(3): repurposing natural metalloenzymes for abiotic transformations(2,4); in silico metalloenzyme (re-)design(5-7); and incorporation of abiotic cofactors into proteins(8-11). The third strategy offers the opportunity to design a wide variety of artificial metalloenzymes for non-natural reactions. However, many metal cofactors are inhibited by cellular components and therefore require purification of the scaffold protein(12-15). This limits the throughput of genetic optimization schemes applied to artificial metalloenzymes and their applicability in vivo to expand natural metabolism. Here we report the compartmentalization and in vivo evolution of an artificial metalloenzyme for olefin metathesis, which represents an archetypal organometallic reaction(16-22) without equivalent in nature. Building on previous work(6) on an artificial metallohydrolase, we exploit the periplasm of Escherichia coli as a reaction compartment for the 'metathase' because it offers an auspicious environment for artificial metalloenzymes, mainly owing to low concentrations of inhibitors such as glutathione, which has recently been identified as a major inhibitor(15). This strategy facilitated the assembly of a functional metathase in vivo and its directed evolution with substantially increased throughput compared to conventional approaches that rely on purified protein variants. The evolved metathase compares favourably with commercial catalysts, shows activity for different metathesis substrates and can be further evolved in different directions by adjusting the workflow. Our results represent the systematic implementation and evolution of an artificial metalloenzyme that catalyses an abiotic reaction in vivo, with potential applications in, for example, non-natural metabolism."], ["Free fatty acids regulate insulin secretion from pancreatic \u03b2 cells through GPR40", "Diabetes, a disease in which carbohydrate and lipid metabolism are regulated improperly by insulin, is a serious worldwide health issue(1,2). Insulin is secreted from pancreatic beta cells in response to elevated plasma glucose, with various factors modifying its secretion(3). Free fatty acids (FFAs) provide an important energy source as nutrients, and they also act as signalling molecules in various cellular processes, including insulin secretion(4,5). Although FFAs are thought to promote insulin secretion in an acute phase, this mechanism is not clearly understood(6). Here we show that a G-protein-coupled receptor, GPR40, which is abundantly expressed in the pancreas, functions as a receptor for long-chain FFAs. Furthermore, we show that long-chain FFAs amplify glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells by activating GPR40. Our results indicate that GPR40 agonists and/or antagonists show potential for the development of new anti-diabetic drugs."], ["Addition of multiple limiting resources reduces grassland diversity", "Niche dimensionality provides a general theoretical explanation for biodiversity-more niches, defined by more limiting factors, allow for more ways that species can coexist(1). Because plant species compete for the same set of limiting resources, theory predicts that addition of a limiting resource eliminates potential trade-offs, reducing the number of species that can coexist(2). Multiple nutrient limitation of plant production is common and therefore fertilization may reduce diversity by reducing the number or dimensionality of belowground limiting factors. At the same time, nutrient addition, by increasing biomass, should ultimately shift competition from belowground nutrients towards a one-dimensional competitive trade-off for light(3). Here we show that plant species diversity decreased when a greater number of limiting nutrients were added across 45 grassland sites from a multi-continent experimental network(4). The number of added nutrients predicted diversity loss, even after controlling for effects of plant biomass, and even where biomass production was not nutrient-limited. We found that elevated resource supply reduced niche dimensionality and diversity and increased both productivity(5) and compositional turnover. Our results point to the importance of understanding dimensionality in ecological systems that are undergoing diversity loss in response to multiple global change factors."], ["Perovskite solar cells with atomically coherent interlayers on SnO<sub>2</sub> electrodes", "In perovskite solar cells, the interfaces between the perovskite and charge-transporting layers contain high concentrations of defects (about 100 times that within the perovskite layer), specifically, deep-level defects, which substantially reduce the power conversion efficiency of the devices(1-3). Recent efforts to reduce these interfacial defects have focused mainly on surface passivation(4-6). However, passivating the perovskite surface that interfaces with the electron-transporting layer is difficult, because the surface-treatment agents on the electron-transporting layer may dissolve while coating the perovskite thin film. Alternatively, interfacial defects may not be a concern if a coherent interface could be formed between the electron-transporting and perovskite layers. Here we report the formation of an interlayer between a SnO2 electron-transporting layer and a halide perovskite light-absorbing layer, achieved by coupling Cl-bonded SnO2 with a Cl-containing perovskite precursor. This interlayer has atomically coherent features, which enhance charge extraction and transport from the perovskite layer, and fewer interfacial defects. The existence of such a coherent interlayer allowed us to fabricate perovskite solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 25.8 per cent (certified 25.5 per cent)under standard illumination. Furthermore, unencapsulated devices maintained about 90 per cent of their initial efficiency even after continuous light exposure for 500 hours. Our findings provide guidelines for designing defect-minimizing interfaces between metal halide perovskites and electron-transporting layers. An atomically coherent interlayer between the electron-transporting and perovskite layers in perovskite solar cells enhances charge extraction and transport from the perovskite, enabling high power conversion efficiency."], ["The ctenophore genome and the evolutionary origins of neural systems", "The origins of neural systems remain unresolved. In contrast to other basal metazoans, ctenophores (comb jellies) have both complex nervous and mesoderm-derived muscular systems. These holoplanktonic predators also have sophisticated ciliated locomotion, behaviour and distinct development. Here we present the draft genome of Pleurobrachia bachei, Pacific sea gooseberry, together with ten other ctenophore transcriptomes, and show that they are remarkably distinct from other animal genomes in their content of neurogenic, immune and developmental genes. Our integrative analyses place Ctenophora as the earliest lineage within Metazoa. This hypothesis is supported by comparative analysis of multiple gene families, including the apparent absence of HOX genes, canonical microRNA machinery, and reduced immune complement in ctenophores. Although two distinct nervous systems are well recognized in ctenophores, many bilaterian neuron-specific genes and genes of 'classical' neurotransmitter pathways either are absent or, if present, are not expressed in neurons. Our metabolomic and physiological data are consistent with the hypothesis that ctenophore neural systems, and possibly muscle specification, evolved independently from those in other animals."], ["Chemical space and biology", "Chemical space - which encompasses all possible small organic molecules, including those present in biological systems - is vast. So vast, in fact, that so far only a tiny fraction of it has been explored. Nevertheless, these explorations have greatly enhanced our understanding of biology, and have led to the development of many of today's drugs. The discovery of new bioactive molecules, facilitated by a deeper understanding of the nature of the regions of chemical space that are relevant to biology, will advance our knowledge of biological processes and lead to new strategies to treat disease."], ["Nanoscale intimacy in bifunctional catalysts for selective conversion of hydrocarbons", "The ability to control nanoscale features precisely is increasingly being exploited to develop and improve monofunctional catalysts(1-4). Striking effects might also be expected in the case of bifunctional catalysts, which are important in the hydrocracking of fossil and renewable hydrocarbon sources to provide high-quality diesel fuel(5-7). Such bifunctional hydrocracking catalysts contain metal sites and acid sites, and for more than 50 years the so-called intimacy criterion(8) has dictated the maximum distance between the two types of site, beyond which catalytic activity decreases. A lack of synthesis and material-characterization methods with nanometre precision has long prevented in-depth exploration of the intimacy criterion, which has often been interpreted simply as 'the closer the better' for positioning metal and acid sites(8-11). Here we show for a bifunctional catalyst-comprising an intimate mixture of zeolite Y and alumina binder, and with platinum metal controllably deposited on either the zeolite or the binder-that closest proximity between metal and zeolite acid sites can be detrimental. Specifically, the selectivity when cracking large hydrocarbon feedstock molecules for high-quality diesel production is optimized with the catalyst that contains platinum on the binder, that is, with a nanoscale rather than closest intimacy of the metal and acid sites. Thus, cracking of the large and complex hydrocarbon molecules that are typically derived from alternative sources, such as gas-to-liquid technology, vegetable oil or algal oil(6,7), should benefit especially from bifunctional catalysts that avoid locating platinum on the zeolite (the traditionally assumed optimal location). More generally, we anticipate that the ability demonstrated here to spatially organize different active sites at the nanoscale will benefit the further development and optimization of the emerging generation of multifunctional catalysts(12-15)."], ["Atmospheric oxidation capacity sustained by a tropical forest", "Terrestrial vegetation, especially tropical rain forest, releases vast quantities of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to the atmosphere(1-3), which are removed by oxidation reactions and deposition of reaction products(4-6). The oxidation is mainly initiated by hydroxyl radicals (OH), primarily formed through the photodissociation of ozone(4). Previously it was thought that, in unpolluted air, biogenic VOCs deplete OH and reduce the atmospheric oxidation capacity(5-10). Conversely, in polluted air VOC oxidation leads to noxious oxidant build-up by the catalytic action of nitrogen oxides(5-10) (NOx = NO + NO2). Here we report aircraft measurements of atmospheric trace gases performed over the pristine Amazon forest. Our data reveal unexpectedly high OH concentrations. We propose that natural VOC oxidation, notably of isoprene, recycles OH efficiently in low-NOx air through reactions of organic peroxy radicals. Computations with an atmospheric chemistry model and the results of laboratory experiments suggest that an OH recycling efficiency of 40-80 per cent in isoprene oxidation may be able to explain the high OH levels we observed in the field. Although further laboratory studies are necessary to explore the chemical mechanism responsible for OH recycling in more detail, our results demonstrate that the biosphere maintains a remarkable balance with the atmospheric environment."], ["RNA velocity of single cells", "RNA abundance is a powerful indicator of the state of individual cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing can reveal RNA abundance with high quantitative accuracy, sensitivity and throughput(1). However, this approach captures only a static snapshot at a point in time, posing a challenge for the analysis of time-resolved phenomena such as embryogenesis or tissue regeneration. Here we show that RNA velocity-the time derivative of the gene expression state-can be directly estimated by distinguishing between unspliced and spliced mRNAs in common single-cell RNA sequencing protocols. RNA velocity is a high-dimensional vector that predicts the future state of individual cells on a timescale of hours. We validate its accuracy in the neural crest lineage, demonstrate its use on multiple published datasets and technical platforms, reveal the branching lineage tree of the developing mouse hippocampus, and examine the kinetics of transcription in human embryonic brain. We expect RNA velocity to greatly aid the analysis of developmental lineages and cellular dynamics, particularly in humans."], ["Xolography for linear volumetric 3D printing", "The range of applications for additive manufacturing is expanding quickly, including mass production of athletic footwear parts(1), dental ceramics(2) and aerospace components(3) as well as fabrication of microfluidics(4), medical devices(5), and artificial organs(6). The light-induced additive manufacturing techniques(7) used are particularly successful owing to their high spatial and temporal control, but such techniques still share the common motifs of pointwise or layered generation, as do stereolithography(8), laser powder bed fusion(9), and continuous liquid interface production(10) and its successors(11,12). Volumetric 3D printing(13-20) is the next step onward from sequential additive manufacturing methods. Here we introduce xolography, a dual colour technique using photoswitchable photoinitiators to induce local polymerization inside a confined monomer volume upon linear excitation by intersecting light beams of different wavelengths. We demonstrate this concept with a volumetric printer designed to generate three-dimensional objects with complex structural features as well as mechanical and optical functions. Compared to state-of-the-art volumetric printing methods, our technique has a resolution about ten times higher than computed axial lithography without feedback optimization, and a volume generation rate four to five orders of magnitude higher than two-photon photopolymerization. We expect this technology to transform rapid volumetric production for objects at the nanoscopic to macroscopic length scales."], ["Mapping the human genetic architecture of COVID-19", "The genetic make-up of an individual contributes to the susceptibility and response to viral infection. Although environmental, clinical and social factors have a role in the chance of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and the severity of COVID-19(1,2), host genetics may also be important. Identifying host-specific genetic factors may reveal biological mechanisms of therapeutic relevance and clarify causal relationships of modifiable environmental risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and outcomes. We formed a global network of researchers to investigate the role of human genetics in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity. Here we describe the results of three genome-wide association meta-analyses that consist of up to 49,562 patients with COVID-19 from 46 studies across 19 countries. We report 13 genome-wide significant loci that are associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection or severe manifestations of COVID-19. Several of these loci correspond to previously documented associations to lung or autoimmune and inflammatory diseases(3-7). They also represent potentially actionable mechanisms in response to infection. Mendelian randomization analyses support a causal role for smoking and body-mass index for severe COVID-19 although not for type II diabetes. The identification of novel host genetic factors associated with COVID-19 was made possible by the community of human genetics researchers coming together to prioritize the sharing of data, results, resources and analytical frameworks. This working model of international collaboration underscores what is possible for future genetic discoveries in emerging pandemics, or indeed for any complex human disease."], ["Detection of N(4S) by resonantly enhanced multiphoton ionizanon spectroscopy", "We report the first instance of detection of N(4S) atoms by Resonantly Enhanced Multiphoton Ionization (REMPI).

The past few decades have, however, witnessed a renaissance in its study, and the importance of the related solvation science is becoming ever more apparent."], ["Stiffness of the human foot and evolution of the transverse arch", "The transverse tarsal arch, acting through the inter-metatarsal tissues, is important for the longitudinal stiffness of the foot and its appearance is a key step in the evolution of human bipedalism. The stiff human foot enables an efficient push-off when walking or running, and was critical for the evolution of bipedalism(1-6). The uniquely arched morphology of the human midfoot is thought to stiffen it(5-9), whereas other primates have flat feet that bend severely in the midfoot(7,10,11). However, the relationship between midfoot geometry and stiffness remains debated in foot biomechanics(12,13), podiatry(14,15) and palaeontology(4-6). These debates centre on the medial longitudinal arch(5,6) and have not considered whether stiffness is affected by the second, transverse tarsal arch of the human foot(16). Here we show that the transverse tarsal arch, acting through the inter-metatarsal tissues, is responsible for more than 40% of the longitudinal stiffness of the foot. The underlying principle resembles a floppy currency note that stiffens considerably when it curls transversally. We derive a dimensionless curvature parameter that governs the stiffness contribution of the transverse tarsal arch, demonstrate its predictive power using mechanical models of the foot and find its skeletal correlate in hominin feet. In the foot, the material properties of the inter-metatarsal tissues and the mobility of the metatarsals may additionally influence the longitudinal stiffness of the foot and thus the curvature-stiffness relationship of the transverse tarsal arch. By analysing fossils, we track the evolution of the curvature parameter among extinct hominins and show that a human-like transverse arch was a key step in the evolution of human bipedalism that predates the genus Homo by at least 1.5 million years. This renewed understanding of the foot may improve the clinical treatment of flatfoot disorders, the design of robotic feet and the study of foot function in locomotion."], ["ACE2 links amino acid malnutrition to microbial ecology and intestinal inflammation", "Malnutrition affects up to one billion people in the world and is a major cause of mortality(1,2). In many cases, malnutrition is associated with diarrhoea and intestinal inflammation, further contributing to morbidity and death(2). The mechanisms by which unbalanced dietary nutrients affect intestinal homeostasis are largely unknown. Here we report that deficiency in murine angiotensin I converting enzyme (peptidyl-dipeptidase A) 2 (Ace2), which encodes a key regulatory enzyme of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), results in highly increased susceptibility to intestinal inflammation induced by epithelial damage. The RAS is known to be involved in acute lung failure(3), cardiovascular functions(4) and SARS infections(5). Mechanistically, ACE2 has a RAS-independent function, regulating intestinal amino acid homeostasis, expression of antimicrobial peptides, and the ecology of the gut microbiome. Transplantation of the altered microbiota from Ace2 mutant mice into germ-free wild-type hosts was able to transmit the increased propensity to develop severe colitis. ACE2-dependent changes in epithelial immunity and the gut microbiota can be directly regulated by the dietary amino acid tryptophan. Our results identify ACE2 as a key regulator of dietary amino acid homeostasis, innate immunity, gut microbial ecology, and transmissible susceptibility to colitis. These results provide a molecular explanation for how amino acid malnutrition can cause intestinal inflammation and diarrhoea."], ["Colloids with valence and specific directional bonding", "The ability to design and assemble three-dimensional structures from colloidal particles is limited by the absence of specific directional bonds. As a result, complex or low-coordination structures, common in atomic and molecular systems, are rare in the colloidal domain. Here we demonstrate a general method for creating the colloidal analogues of atoms with valence: colloidal particles with chemically distinct surface patches that imitate hybridized atomic orbitals, including sp, sp(2), sp(3), sp(3)d, sp(3)d(2) and sp(3)d(3). Functionalized with DNA with single-stranded sticky ends, patches on different particles can form highly directional bonds through programmable, specific and reversible DNA hybridization. These features allow the particles to self-assemble into 'colloidal molecules' with triangular, tetrahedral and other bonding symmetries, and should also give access to a rich variety of new microstructured colloidal materials."], ["mRNA circularization by METTL3-eIF3h enhances translation and promotes oncogenesis", "N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) modification of mRNA is emerging as an important regulator of gene expression that affects different developmental and biological processes, and altered m(6)A homeostasis is linked to cancer(1-5). m(6)A modification is catalysed by METTL3 and enriched in the 3' untranslated region of a large subset of mRNAs at sites close to the stop codon(5). METTL3 can promote translation but the mechanism and relevance of this process remain unknown(1). Here we show that METTL3 enhances translation only when tethered to reporter mRNA at sites close to the stop codon, supporting a mechanism of mRNA looping for ribosome recycling and translational control. Electron microscopy reveals the topology of individual polyribosomes with single METTL3 foci in close proximity to 5' cap-binding proteins. We identify a direct physical and functional interaction between METTL3 and the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit h (eIF3h). METTL3 promotes translation of a large subset of oncogenic mRNAs-including bromodomain-containing protein 4-that is also m(6)A-modified in human primary lung tumours. The METTL3-eIF3h interaction is required for enhanced translation, formation of densely packed polyribosomes and oncogenic transformation. METTL3 depletion inhibits tumorigenicity and sensitizes lung cancer cells to BRD4 inhibition. These findings uncover a mechanism of translation control that is based on mRNA looping and identify METTL3-eIF3h as a potential therapeutic target for patients with cancer."], ["Spin splitting of dopant edge state in magnetic zigzag graphene nanoribbons", "Spin-ordered electronic states in hydrogen-terminated zigzag nanographene give rise to magnetic quantum phenomena(1,2) that have sparked renewed interest in carbon-based spintronics(3,4). Zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs)-quasi one-dimensional semiconducting strips of graphene bounded by parallel zigzag edges-host intrinsic electronic edge states that are ferromagnetically ordered along the edges of the ribbon and antiferromagnetically coupled across its width(1,2,5). Despite recent advances in the bottom-up synthesis of GNRs featuring symmetry protected topological phases(6-8) and even metallic zero mode bands(9), the unique magnetic edge structure of ZGNRs has long been obscured from direct observation by a strong hybridization of the zigzag edge states with the surface states of the underlying support(10-15). Here, we present a general technique to thermodynamically stabilize and electronically decouple the highly reactive spin-polarized edge states by introducing a superlattice of substitutional N-atom dopants along the edges of a ZGNR. First-principles GW calculations and scanning tunnelling spectroscopy reveal a giant spin splitting of low-lying nitrogen lone-pair flat bands by an exchange field (similar to 850 tesla) induced by the ferromagnetically ordered edge states of ZGNRs. Our findings directly corroborate the nature of the predicted emergent magnetic order in ZGNRs and provide a robust platform for their exploration and functional integration into nanoscale sensing and logic devices(15-21)."], ["3D Printing of High Viscosity UV-Curable Resin for Highly Stretchable and Resilient Elastomer", "Elastomers prepared via vat photopolymerizationus ually exhibit unsatisfied mechanical properties owing to their insufficient growth of molecular weight upon UV exposure. Increasing the weight ratio of oligomer in the resin system is an effective approach to enhance the mechanical properties, yet the viscosity of the UV-curable resin increases dramatically; this hinders its printing. In this study, a linear scan-based vat photopolymerization (LSVP) system which can print high-viscosity resins is implemented to 3D print the oligomer-dominated UV-curable resin via a dual-curing mechanism. A polyurethane methacrylate blocking oligomer is first synthesized and then mixed with a commercialized bifunctional oligomer, photoinitiator, and primary amine as a chain extender to prepare high-viscosity UV-curable resin for the LSVP system. The deblocked isocyanate is further crosslinked with a chain extender via thermal treatment to construct a highly entangled polymer chain network. The optimal thermal treatment parameters are investigated, and the resilience of the 3D-printed elastomer is evaluated through continuous tensile loading and unloading tests. Subsequently, complex structured elastomers are printed, exhibiting favorable mechanical durability without defects. The results obtained from this work will provide a reference for preparing elastomeric devices with excellent physical properties and expand the application scope of vat photopolymerization to new fields."], ["Electromagnetic interference shielding with 2D transition metal carbides (MXenes)", "Materials with good flexibility and high conductivity that can provide electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding with minimal thickness are highly desirable, especially if they can be easily processed into films. Two-dimensional metal carbides and nitrides, known as MXenes, combine metallic conductivity and hydrophilic surfaces. Here, we demonstrate the potential of several MXenes and their polymer composites for EMI shielding. A 45-micrometer-thick Ti3C2Tx film exhibited EMI shielding effectiveness of 92 decibels (>50 decibels for a 2.5-micrometer film), which is the highest among synthetic materials of comparable thickness produced to date. This performance originates from the excellent electrical conductivity of Ti3C2Tx films (4600 Siemens per centimeter) and multiple internal reflections from Ti3C2Tx flakes in free-standing films. The mechanical flexibility and easy coating capability offered by MXenes and their composites enable them to shield surfaces of any shape while providing high EMI shielding efficiency."], ["Superconductivity without phonons", "The idea of superconductivity without the mediating role of lattice vibrations (phonons) has a long history. It was realized soon after the publication of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer ( BCS) theory of superconductivity 50 years ago that a full treatment of both the charge and spin degrees of freedom of the electron predicts the existence of attractive components of the effective interaction between electrons even in the absence of lattice vibrations - a particular example is the effective interaction that depends on the relative spins of the electrons. Such attraction without phonons can lead to electronic pairing and to unconventional forms of superconductivity that can be much more sensitive than traditional ( BCS) superconductivity to the precise details of the crystal structure and to the electronic and magnetic properties of a material."], ["Reductive glutamine metabolism by IDH1 mediates lipogenesis under hypoxia", "Acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA) is the central biosynthetic precursor for fatty-acid synthesis and protein acetylation. In the conventional view of mammalian cell metabolism, AcCoA is primarily generated from glucose-derived pyruvate through the citrate shuttle and ATP citrate lyase in the cytosol(1-3). However, proliferating cells that exhibit aerobic glycolysis and those exposed to hypoxia convert glucose to lactate at near-stoichiometric levels, directing glucose carbon away from the tricarboxylic acid cycle and fatty-acid synthesis(4). Although glutamine is consumed at levels exceeding that required for nitrogen biosynthesis(5), the regulation and use of glutamine metabolism in hypoxic cells is not well understood. Here we show that human cells use reductive metabolism of alpha-ketoglutarate to synthesize AcCoA for lipid synthesis. This isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1)-dependent pathway is active in most cell lines under normal culture conditions, but cells grown under hypoxia rely almost exclusively on the reductive carboxylation of glutamine-derived alpha-ketoglutarate for de novo lipogenesis. Furthermore, renal cell lines deficient in the von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor protein preferentially use reductive glutamine metabolism for lipid biosynthesis even at normal oxygen levels. These results identify a critical role for oxygen in regulating carbon use to produce AcCoA and support lipid synthesis in mammalian cells."], ["Geometric quantum computation using nuclear magnetic resonance", "A significant development in computing has been the discovery(1) that the computational power of quantum computers exceeds that of Turing machines. Central to the experimental realization of quantum information processing is the construction of fault-tolerant quantum logic gates. Their operation requires conditional quantum dynamics, in which one sub-system undergoes a coherent evolution that depends on the quantum state of another sub-system(2); in particular, the evolving sub-system may acquire a conditional phase shift. Although conventionally dynamic in origin, phase shifts can also be geometric(3,4) Conditional geometric (or 'Berry') phases depend only on the geometry of the path executed, and are therefore resilient to certain types of errors; this suggests the possibility of an intrinsically fault-tolerant way of performing quantum gate operations. Nuclear magnetic resonance techniques have already been used to demonstrate both simple quantum information processing(5-9) and geometric phase shifts(10-12). Here we combine these ideas by performing a nuclear magnetic resonance experiment in which a conditional Berry phase is implemented, demonstrating a controlled phase shift gate."], ["Infinite-layer iron oxide with a square-planar coordination", "Conventional high- temperature reactions limit the control of coordination polyhedra in transition- metal oxides to those obtainable within the bounds of known coordination geometries for a given transition metal(1). For example, iron atoms are almost exclusively coordinated by three- dimensional polyhedra such as tetrahedra and octahedra. However, recent works have shown that binary metal hydrides act as reducing agents at low temperatures, allowing access to unprecedented structures(2-4). Here we show the reaction of a perovskite SrFeO3 with CaH2 to yield SrFeO2, a new compound bearing a square- planar oxygen coordination around Fe2(+). SrFeO2 is isostructural with 'infinite layer' cupric oxides(5-8), and exhibits a magnetic order far above room temperature in spite of the two-dimensional structure, indicating strong in-layer magnetic interactions due to strong Fe d to O p hybridization. Surprisingly, SrFeO2 remains free from the structural instability that might well be expected at low temperatures owing to twofold orbital degeneracy in the Fe2+ ground state with D-4h point symmetry. The reduction and the oxidation between SrFeO2 and SrFeO3 proceed via the brownmillerite- type intermediate SrFeO2.5, and start at the relatively low temperature of similar to 400 K, making the material appealing for a variety of applications, including oxygen ion conduction, oxygen gas absorption and catalysis."], ["Colloidal diamond", "Self-assembling colloidal particles in the cubic diamond crystal structure could potentially be used to make materials with a photonic bandgap(1-3). Such materials are beneficial because they suppress spontaneous emission of light(1)and are valued for their applications as optical waveguides, filters and laser resonators(4), for improving light-harvesting technologies(5-7and for other applications4,8). Cubic diamond is preferred for these applications over more easily self-assembled structures, such as face-centred-cubic structures(9,10), because diamond has a much wider bandgap and is less sensitive to imperfections(11,12). In addition, the bandgap in diamond crystals appears at a refractive index contrast of about 2, which means that a photonic bandgap could be achieved using known materials at optical frequencies; this does not seem to be possible for face-centred-cubic crystals(3,13). However, self-assembly of colloidal diamond is challenging. Because particles in a diamond lattice are tetrahedrally coordinated, one approach has been to self-assemble spherical particles with tetrahedral sticky patches(14-16). But this approach lacks a mechanism to ensure that the patchy spheres select the staggered orientation of tetrahedral bonds on nearest-neighbour particles, which is required for cubic diamond(15,17). Here we show that by using partially compressed tetrahedral clusters with retracted sticky patches, colloidal cubic diamond can be self-assembled using patch-patch adhesion in combination with a steric interlock mechanism that selects the required staggered bond orientation. Photonic bandstructure calculations reveal that the resulting lattices (direct and inverse) have promising optical properties, including a wide and complete photonic bandgap. The colloidal particles in the self-assembled cubic diamond structure are highly constrained and mechanically stable, which makes it possible to dry the suspension and retain the diamond structure. This makes these structures suitable templates for forming high-dielectric-contrast photonic crystals with cubic diamond symmetry. Self-assembly of cubic diamond crystals is demonstrated, by using precursor clusters of particles with carefully placed 'sticky' patches that attract and bind adjacent clusters in specific geometries."], ["Solving a Higgs optimization problem with quantum annealing for machine learning", "The discovery of Higgs-boson decays in a background of standard-model processes was assisted by machine learning methods(1,2). The classifiers used to separate signals such as these from background are trained using highly unerring but not completely perfect simulations of the physical processes involved, often resulting in incorrect labelling of background processes or signals (label noise) and systematic errors. Here we use quantum(3-6) and classical(7,8) annealing (probabilistic techniques for approximating the global maximum or minimum of a given function) to solve a Higgs-signal-versus-background machine learning optimization problem, mapped to a problem of finding the ground state of a corresponding Ising spin model. We build a set of weak classifiers based on the kinematic observables of the Higgs decay photons, which we then use to construct a strong classifier. This strong classifier is highly resilient against overtraining and against errors in the correlations of the physical observables in the training data. We show that the resulting quantum and classical annealing-based classifier systems perform comparably to the state-of-the-art machine learning methods that are currently used in particle physics(9,10). However, in contrast to these methods, the annealing-based classifiers are simple functions of directly interpretable experimental parameters with clear physical meaning. The annealer-trained classifiers use the excited states in the vicinity of the ground state and demonstrate some advantage over traditional machine learning methods for small training datasets. Given the relative simplicity of the algorithm and its robustness to error, this technique may find application in other areas of experimental particle physics, such as real-time decision making in event-selection problems and classification in neutrino physics."], ["Oriented nucleation in formamidinium perovskite for photovoltaics", "The black phase of formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI(3)) perovskite shows huge promise as an efficient photovoltaic, but it is not favoured energetically at room temperature, meaning that the undesirable yellow phases are always present alongside it during crystallization1-4. This problem has made it difficult to formulate the fast crystallization process of perovskite and develop guidelines governing the formation of black-phase FAPbI3 (refs. 5,6). Here we use in situ monitoring of the perovskite crystallization process to report an oriented nucleation mechanism that can help to avoid the presence of undesirable phases and improve the performance of photovoltaic devices in different film-processing scenarios. The resulting device has a demonstrated power-conversion efficiency of 25.4% (certified 25.0%) and the module, which has an area of 27.83 cm(2), has achieved an impressive certified aperture efficiency of 21.4%."], ["Mirror extreme BMI phenotypes associated with gene dosage at the chromosome 16p11.2 locus", "Both obesity and being underweight have been associated with increased mortality(1,2). Underweight, defined as a body mass index (BMI) <= 18.5 kg per m(2) in adults and <= -2 standard deviations from the mean in children, is the main sign of a series of heterogeneous clinical conditions including failure to thrive(3-5), feeding and eating disorder and/or anorexia nervosa(6,7). In contrast to obesity, few genetic variants underlying these clinical conditions have been reported(8,9). We previously showed that hemizygosity of a similar to 600-kilobase (kb) region on the short arm of chromosome 16 causes a highly penetrant form of obesity that is often associated with hyperphagia and intellectual disabilities(10). Here we show that the corresponding reciprocal duplication is associated with being underweight. We identified 138 duplication carriers (including 132 novel cases and 108 unrelated carriers) from individuals clinically referred for developmental or intellectual disabilities (DD/ID) or psychiatric disorders, or recruited from population-based cohorts. These carriers show significantly reduced postnatal weight and BMI. Half of the boys younger than five years are underweight with a probable diagnosis of failure to thrive, whereas adult duplication carriers have an 8.3-fold increased risk of being clinically underweight. We observe a trend towards increased severity in males, as well as a depletion of male carriers among non-medically ascertained cases. These features are associated with an unusually high frequency of selective and restrictive eating behaviours and a significant reduction in head circumference. Each of the observed phenotypes is the converse of one reported in carriers of deletions at this locus. The phenotypes correlate with changes in transcript levels for genes mapping within the duplication but not in flanking regions. The reciprocal impact of these 16p11.2 copy-number variants indicates that severe obesity and being underweight could have mirror aetiologies, possibly through contrasting effects on energy balance."], ["Scalable anisotropic cooling aerogels by additive freeze-casting", "Cooling in buildings is vital to human well-being but inevitability consumes significant energy, adding pressure on achieving carbon neutrality. Thermally superinsulating aerogels are promising to isolate the heat for more energy-efficient cooling. However, most aerogels tend to absorb the sunlight for unwanted solar heat gain, and it is challenging to scale up the aerogel fabrication while maintaining consistent properties. Herein, we develop a thermally insulating, solar-reflective anisotropic cooling aerogel panel containing in-plane aligned pores with engineered pore walls using boron nitride nanosheets by an additive freeze-casting technique. The additive freeze-casting offers highly controllable and cumulative freezing dynamics for fabricating decimeter-scale aerogel panels with consistent in-plane pore alignments. The unique anisotropic thermo-optical properties of the nanosheets combined with in-plane pore channels enable the anisotropic cooling aerogel to deliver an ultralow out-of-plane thermal conductivity of 16.9\u2009mW\u2009m\u22121 K\u22121 and a high solar reflectance of 97%. The excellent dual functionalities allow the anisotropic cooling aerogel to minimize both parasitic and solar heat gains when used as cooling panels under direct sunlight, achieving an up to 7\u2009\u00b0C lower interior temperature than commercial silica aerogels. This work offers a new paradigm for the bottom-up fabrication of scalable anisotropic aerogels towards practical energy-efficient cooling applications."], ["Delayed fluorescence from inverted singlet and triplet excited states", "Hund's multiplicity rule states that a higher spin state has a lower energy for a given electronic configuration(1). Rephrasing this rule for molecular excited states predicts a positive energy gap between spin-singlet and spin-triplet excited states, as has been consistent with numerous experimental observations over almost a century. Here we report a fluorescent molecule that disobeys Hund's rule and has a negative singlet-triplet energy gap of -11 +/- 2 meV. The energy inversion of the singlet and triplet excited states results in delayed fluorescence with short time constants of 0.2 mu s, which anomalously decrease with decreasing temperature owing to the emissive singlet character of the lowest-energy excited state. Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) using this molecule exhibited a fast transient electroluminescence decay with a peak external quantum efficiency of 17%, demonstrating its potential implications for optoelectronic devices, including displays, lighting and lasers."], ["The nature and transport mechanism of hydrated hydroxide ions in aqueous solution", "Compared to other ions, protons (H+) and hydroxide ions (OH-) exhibit anomalously high mobilities in aqueous solutions(1). On a qualitative level, this behaviour has long been explained by 'structural diffusion'-the continuous interconversion between hydration complexes driven by fluctuations in the solvation shell of the hydrated ions. Detailed investigations have led to a clear understanding of the proton transport mechanism at the molecular level(2-8). In contrast, hydroxide ion mobility in basic solutions has received far less attention(2,3,9,10), even though bases and base catalysis play important roles in many organic and biochemical reactions and in the chemical industry. The reason for this may be attributed to the century-old notion(11) that a hydrated OH- can be regarded as a water molecule missing a proton, and that the transport mechanism of such a 'proton hole' can be inferred from that of an excess proton by simply reversing hydrogen bond polarities(11-18). However, recent studies(2,3) have identified OH- hydration complexes that bear little structural similarity to proton hydration complexes. Here we report the solution structures and transport mechanisms of hydrated hydroxide, which we obtained from first-principles computer simulations that explicitly treat quantum and thermal fluctuations of all nuclei(19-21). We find that the transport mechanism, which differs significantly from the proton hole picture, involves an interplay between the previously identified hydration complexes(2,3) and is strongly influenced by nuclear quantum effects."], ["Production of phosphorene nanoribbons", "Phosphorene is a mono-elemental, two-dimensional (2D) substance with outstanding, highly directional properties and a bandgap that depends on the number of layers of the material(1-8). Nanoribbons, meanwhile, combine the flexibility and unidirectional properties of one-dimensional nanomaterials, the high surface area of 2D nanomaterials and the electron-confinement and edge effects of both. The structures of nanoribbons can thus lead to exceptional control over electronic band structure, the emergence of novel phenomena and unique architectures for applications(5,6,9-24). Phosphorene's intrinsically anisotropic structure has motivated numerous theoretical calculations of phosphorene nanoribbons (PNRs), predicting extraordinary properties(5,6,12-24). So far, however, discrete PNRs have not been produced. Here we present a method for creating quantities of high-quality, individual PNRs by ionic scissoring of macroscopic black phosphorus crystals. This top-down process results in stable liquid dispersions of PNRs with typical widths of 4-50 nm, predominantly single-layer thickness, measured lengths of up to 75 mu m and aspect ratios of up to 1,000. The nanoribbons are atomically flat single crystals, aligned exclusively in the zigzag crystallographic orientation. The ribbons have remarkably uniform widths along their entire lengths, and are extremely flexible. These properties-together with the ease of downstream manipulation via liquid-phase methods-should enable the search for predicted exotic states(6,12-14,17-19,21), and an array of applications in which PNRs have been predicted to offer transformative advantages. These applications range from thermoelectric devices to high-capacity fast-charging batteries and integrated high-speed electronic circuits(6,14-16,20,23,24)."], ["Signatures of moire trions in WSe<sub>2</sub>/MoSe<sub>2</sub> heterobilayers", "Moire superlattices formed by van der Waals materials can support a wide range of electronic phases, including Mott insulators(1-4), superconductors(5-10) and generalized Wigner crystals(2). When excitons are confined by a moire superlattice, a new class of exciton emerges, which holds promise for realizing artificial excitonic crystals and quantum optical effects(11-16). When such moire excitons are coupled to charge carriers, correlated states may arise. However, no experimental evidence exists for charge-coupled moire exciton states, nor have their properties been predicted by theory. Here we report the optical signatures of trions coupled to the moire potential in tungsten diselenide/molybdenum diselenide heterobilayers. The moire trions show multiple sharp emission lines with a complex charge-density dependence, in stark contrast to the behaviour of conventional trions. We infer distinct contributions to the trion emission from radiative decay in which the remaining carrier resides in different moire minibands. Variation of the trion features is observed in different devices and sample areas, indicating high sensitivity to sample inhomogeneity and variability. The observation of these trion features motivates further theoretical and experimental studies of higher-order electron correlation effects in moire superlattices."], ["Three-dimensional integration of two-dimensional field-effect transistors", "In the field of semiconductors, three-dimensional (3D) integration not only enables packaging of more devices per unit area, referred to as 'More Moore'1 but also introduces multifunctionalities for 'More than Moore'2 technologies. Although silicon-based 3D integrated circuits are commercially available3-5, there is limited effort on 3D integration of emerging nanomaterials6,7 such as two-dimensional (2D) materials despite their unique functionalities7-10. Here we demonstrate (1) wafer-scale and monolithic two-tier 3D integration based on MoS2 with more than 10,000 field-effect transistors (FETs) in each tier; (2) three-tier 3D integration based on both MoS2 and WSe2 with about 500 FETs in each tier; and (3) two-tier 3D integration based on 200 scaled MoS2 FETs (channel length, LCH = 45 nm) in each tier. We also realize a 3D circuit and demonstrate multifunctional capabilities, including sensing and storage. We believe that our demonstrations will serve as the foundation for more sophisticated, highly dense and functionally divergent integrated circuits with a larger number of tiers integrated monolithically in the third dimension.

It is the preferred manufacturing method for industrial ceramics. The observation of Burke and Coble(1,2) that certain crystalline granular solids could gain full density and translucency by solid-state sintering was an important milestone for modern technical ceramics. But these final-stage sintering processes are always accompanied by rapid grain growth(3,6), because the capillary driving forces for sintering (involving surfaces) and grain growth (involving grain boundaries) are comparable in magnitude, both being proportional to the reciprocal grain size. This has greatly hampered efforts to produce dense materials with nanometre-scale structure (grain size less than 100 nm)(4,8), leading many researchers to resort to the 'brute force' approach of high-pressure consolidation at elevated temperatures(7-9). Here we show that fully dense cubic Y2O3 (melting point, 2,439 degrees C) with a grain size of 60 nm can be prepared by a simple two-step sintering method, at temperatures of about 1,000 degrees C without applied pressure. The suppression of the final-stage grain growth is achieved by exploiting the difference in kinetics between grain-boundary diffusion and grain-boundary migration. Such a process should facilitate the cost-effective preparation of other nanocrystalline materials for practical applications."], ["Maximizing and stabilizing luminescence from halide perovskites with potassium passivation", "Metal halide perovskites are of great interest for various high-performance optoelectronic applications(1). The ability to tune the perovskite bandgap continuously by modifying the chemical composition opens up applications for perovskites as coloured emitters, in building-integrated photovoltaics, and as components of tandem photovoltaics to increase the power conversion efficiency(2-4). Nevertheless, performance is limited by non-radiative losses, with luminescence yields in state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells still far from 100 per cent under standard solar illumination conditions(5-7). Furthermore, in mixed halide perovskite systems designed for continuous bandgap tunability(2) (bandgaps of approximately 1.7 to 1.9 electronvolts), photoinduced ion segregation leads to bandgap instabilities(8,9). Here we demonstrate substantial mitigation of both non-radiative losses and photoinduced ion migration in perovskite films and interfaces by decorating the surfaces and grain boundaries with passivating potassium halide layers. We demonstrate external photoluminescence quantum yields of 66 per cent, which translate to internal yields that exceed 95 per cent. The high luminescence yields are achieved while maintaining high mobilities of more than 40 square centimetres per volt per second, providing the elusive combination of both high luminescence and excellent charge transport(10). When interfaced with electrodes in a solar cell device stack, the external luminescence yielda quantity that must be maximized to obtain high efficiencyremains as high as 15 per cent, indicating very clean interfaces. We also demonstrate the inhibition of transient photoinduced ion-migration processes across a wide range of mixed halide perovskite bandgaps in materials that exhibit bandgap instabilities when unpassivated. We validate these results in fully operating solar cells. Our work represents an important advance in the construction of tunable metal halide perovskite films and interfaces that can approach the efficiency limits in tandem solar cells, coloured-light-emitting diodes and other optoelectronic applications."], ["Mastering the surface strain of platinum catalysts for efficient electrocatalysis", "Platinum (Pt) has found wide use as an electrocatalyst for sustainable energy conversion systems(1-3). The activity of Pt is controlled by its electronic structure (typically, the d-band centre), which depends sensitively on lattice strain(4,5). This dependence can be exploited for catalyst design(4,6-8), and the use of core-shell structures and elastic substrates has resulted in strain-engineered Pt catalysts with drastically improved electrocatalytic performances(7,9-13). However, it is challenging to map in detail the strain-activity correlations in Pt-catalysed conversions, which can involve a number of distinct processes, and to identify the optimal strain modification for specific reactions. Here we show that when ultrathin Pt shells are deposited on palladium-based nanocubes, expansion and shrinkage of the nanocubes through phosphorization and dephosphorization induces strain in the Pt(100) lattice that can be adjusted from -5.1 per cent to 5.9 per cent. We use this strain control to tune the electrocatalytic activity of the Pt shells over a wide range, finding that the strain-activity correlation for the methanol oxidation reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction follows an M-shaped curve and a volcano-shaped curve, respectively. We anticipate that our approach can be used to screen out lattice strain that will optimize the performance of Pt catalysts-and potentially other metal catalysts-for a wide range of reactions."], ["Inverse transition of labyrinthine domain patterns in ferroelectric thin films", "Phase separation is a cooperative process, the kinetics of which underpin the orderly morphogenesis of domain patterns on mesoscopic scales(1,2). Systems of highly degenerate frozen states may exhibit the rare and counterintuitive inverse-symmetrybreaking phenomenon(3). Proposed a century ago(4), inverse transitions have been found experimentally in disparate materials, ranging from polymeric and colloidal compounds to high-transition-temperature superconductors, proteins, ultrathin magnetic films, liquid crystals and metallic alloys(5,6), with the notable exception of ferroelectric oxides, despite extensive theoretical and experimental work on the latter. Here we show that following a subcritical quench, the non-equilibrium self-assembly of ferroelectric domains in ultrathin films of Pb(Zr0.4Ti0.6)O-3 results in a maze, or labyrinthine pattern, featuring meandering stripe domains. Furthermore, upon increasing the temperature, this highly degenerate labyrinthine phase undergoes an inverse transition whereby it transforms into the less-symmetric parallel-stripe domain structure, before the onset of paraelectricity at higher temperatures. We find that this phase sequence can be ascribed to an enhanced entropic contribution of domain walls, and that domain straightening and coarsening is predominantly driven by the relaxation and diffusion of topological defects. Computational modelling and experimental observation of the inverse dipolar transition in BiFeO3 suggest the universality of the phenomenon in ferroelectric oxides. The multitude of self-patterned states and the various topological defects that they embody may be used beyond current domain and domain-wall-based(7) technologies by enabling fundamentally new design principles and topologically enhanced functionalities within ferroelectric films."], ["Selective sulfidation of metal compounds", "There is urgent, unprecedented demand for critical by-product and co-product metallic elements for the infrastructure (magnets, batteries, catalysts and electronics) needed to power society with renewable electricity(1-3). However, the extraction of d-block and f-block metals from mineral and recycled streams is thermodynamically difficult, typically requiring complete dissolution of the materials, followed by liquid-liquid separation using metal-ion complexing or chelating behaviour(4,5). The similar electronic structure of these metals results in poor separation factors, necessitating immense energy, water and chemicals consumption(6-8). Here a metal-processing approach based on selective anion exchange is proposed. Several simple process levers (gas partial pressure, gas flowrate and carbon addition) are demonstrated to selectively sulfidize a target metal from a mixed metal-oxide feed. The physical and chemical differences between the sulfide and oxide compounds (for example, density, magnetic susceptibility and surface chemistry) can then be exploited for vastly improved separation compared with liquid-liquid methods(9). The process conditions of sulfidation are provided for 56 elements and demonstrated for 15 of them. An assessment of the environmental and economic impacts suggests a path towards 60-90% reductions in greenhouse gas emissions while offering substantial capital cost savings compared with liquid-liquid hydrometallurgy."], ["Caspase-12 mediates endoplasmic-reticulum-specific apoptosis and cytotoxicity by amyloid-\u03b2", "Apoptosis, or cellular suicide, is important for normal development and tissue homeostasis, but too much or too Little apoptosis can also cause disease(1,2). The family of cysteine proteases, the so-called caspases, are critical mediators of programmed cell death(3), and thus far 14 family members have been identified. Some of these, such as caspase-(8) (refs 4, 5), mediate signal transduction downstream of death receptors located on the plasma membrane. Others, such as caspase-9 (ref. 6), mediate apoptotic signals after mitochondrial damage. Stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) can also result in apoptosis(7). Here we show that caspase-12 is localized to the ER and activated by ER stress, including disruption of ER calcium homeostasis and accumulation of excess proteins in ER, but not by membrane- or mitochondrial-targeted apoptotic signals. Mice that are deficient in caspase-12 are resistant to ER stress-induced apoptosis, but their cells undergo apoptosis in response to other death stimuli. Furthermore, we show that caspase-12-deficient cortical neurons are defective in apoptosis induced by amyloid-beta protein but not by staurosporine or trophic factor deprivation. Thus, caspase-12 mediates an ER-specific apoptosis pathway and may contribute to amyloid-beta neurotoxicity."], ["Electroreduction of carbon monoxide to liquid fuel on oxide-derived nanocrystalline copper", "The electrochemical conversion of CO2 and H2O into liquid fuel is ideal for high-density renewable energy storage and could provide an incentive for CO2 capture. However, efficient electrocatalysts for reducing CO2 and its derivatives into a desirable fuel(1-3) are not available at present. Although many catalysts(4-11) can reduce CO2 to carbon monoxide (CO), liquid fuel synthesis requires that CO is reduced further, using H2O as a H+ source. Copper (Cu) is the only known material with an appreciable CO electroreduction activity, but in bulk form its efficiency and selectivity for liquid fuel are far too low for practical use. In particular, H2O reduction to H-2 outcompetes CO reduction on Cu electrodes unless extreme overpotentials are applied, at which point gaseous hydrocarbons are the major CO reduction products(12,13). Here we show that nanocrystalline Cu prepared from Cu2O ('oxide-derivedCu') produces multi-carbon oxygenates (ethanol, acetate and n-propanol) with up to 57% Faraday efficiency at modest potentials (-0.25 volts to -0.5 volts versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) in CO-saturated alkaline H2O. By comparison, when prepared by traditional vapour condensation, Cu nanoparticles with an average crystallite size similar to that of oxide-derived copper produce nearly exclusive H-2 (96% Faraday efficiency) under identical conditions. Our results demonstrate the ability to change the intrinsic catalytic properties of Cu for this notoriously difficult reaction by growing interconnected nanocrystallites from the constrained environment of an oxide lattice. The selectivity for oxygenates, with ethanol as the major product, demonstrates the feasibility of a two-step conversion of CO2 to liquid fuel that could be powered by renewable electricity."], ["High-strength scalable MXene films through bridging-induced densification", "MXenes are a growing family of two-dimensional transition metal carbides and/or nitrides that are densely stacked into macroscopically layered films and have been considered for applications such as flexible electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials. However, the mechanical and electrical reliabilities of titanium carbide MXene films are affected by voids in their structure. We applied sequential bridging of hydrogen and covalent bonding agents to induce the densification of MXene films and removal of the voids, leading to highly compact MXene films. The obtained MXene films show high tensile strength, in combination with high toughness, electrical conductivity, and EMI shielding capability. Our high-performance MXene films are scalable, providing an avenue for assembling other two-dimensional platelets into high-performance films."], ["Flexible high-temperature dielectric materials from polymer nanocomposites", "Dielectric materials, which store energy electrostatically, are ubiquitous in advanced electronics and electric power systems(1-8). Compared to their ceramic counterparts, polymer dielectrics have higher breakdown strengths and greater reliability(1-3,9), are scalable, lightweight and can be shaped into intricate configurations, and are therefore an ideal choice for many power electronics, power conditioning, and pulsed power applications(1,9,10). However, polymer dielectrics are limited to relatively low working temperatures, and thus fail to meet the rising demand for electricity under the extreme conditions present in applications such as hybrid and electric vehicles, aerospace power electronics, and underground oil and gas exploration(11-13). Here we describe crosslinked polymer nanocomposites that contain boron nitride nanosheets, the dielectric properties of which are stable over a broad temperature and frequency range. The nanocomposites have outstanding high-voltage capacitive energy storage capabilities at record temperatures (a Weibull breakdown strength of 403 megavolts per metre and a discharged energy density of 1.8 joules per cubic centimetre at 250 degrees Celsius). Their electrical conduction is several orders of magnitude lower than that of existing polymers and their high operating temperatures are attributed to greatly improved thermal conductivity, owing to the presence of the boron nitride nanosheets, which improve heat dissipation compared to pristine polymers (which are inherently susceptible to thermal runaway). Moreover, the polymer nanocomposites are lightweight, photopatternable and mechanically flexible, and have been demonstrated to preserve excellent dielectric and capacitive performance after intensive bending cycles. These findings enable broader applications of organic materials in high-temperature electronics and energy storage devices."], ["Nanometre-scale thermometry in a living cell", "Sensitive probing of temperature variations on nanometre scales is an outstanding challenge in many areas of modern science and technology(1). In particular, a thermometer capable of subdegree temperature resolution over a large range of temperatures as well as integration within a living system could provide a powerful new tool in many areas of biological, physical and chemical research. Possibilities range from the temperature-induced control of gene expression(2-5) and tumour metabolism(6) to the cell-selective treatment of disease(7,8) and the study of heat dissipation in integrated circuits(1). By combining local light-induced heat sources with sensitive nanoscale thermometry, it may also be possible to engineer biological processes at the subcellular level(2-5). Here we demonstrate a new approach to nanoscale thermometry that uses coherent manipulation of the electronic spin associated with nitrogen-vacancy colour centres in diamond. Our technique makes it possible to detect temperature variations as small as 1.8 mK (a sensitivity of 9 mK Hz(-1/2)) in an ultrapure bulk diamond sample. Using nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond nanocrystals (nanodiamonds), we directly measure the local thermal environment on length scales as short as 200 nanometres. Finally, by introducing both nanodiamonds and gold nanoparticles into a single human embryonic fibroblast, we demonstrate temperature-gradient control and mapping at the subcellular level, enabling unique potential applications in life sciences."], ["Uptake through glycoprotein 2 of FimH<SUP>+</SUP> bacteria by M cells initiates mucosal immune response", "The mucosal immune system forms the largest part of the entire immune system, containing about three-quarters of all lymphocytes and producing grams of secretory IgA daily to protect the mucosal surface from pathogens(1-3). To evoke the mucosal immune response, antigens on the mucosal surface must be transported across the epithelial barrier into organized lymphoid structures such as Peyer's patches(4). This function, called antigen transcytosis, is mediated by specialized epithelial M cells(5,6). The molecular mechanisms promoting this antigen uptake, however, are largely unknown. Here we report that glycoprotein 2 (GP2), specifically expressed on the apical plasma membrane of M cells among enterocytes, serves as a transcytotic receptor for mucosal antigens. Recombinant GP2 protein selectively bound a subset of commensal and pathogenic enterobacteria, including Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), by recognizing FimH, a component of type I pili on the bacterial outer membrane. Consistently, these bacteria were colocalized with endogenous GP2 on the apical plasma membrane as well as in cytoplasmic vesicles in M cells. Moreover, deficiency of bacterial FimH or host GP2 led to defects in transcytosis of type-I-piliated bacteria through M cells, resulting in an attenuation of antigen-specific immune responses in Peyer's patches. GP2 is therefore a previously unrecognized transcytotic receptor on M cells for type-I-piliated bacteria and is a prerequisite for the mucosal immune response to these bacteria. Given that M cells are considered a promising target for oral vaccination against various infectious diseases(7,8), the GP2-dependent transcytotic pathway could provide a new target for the development of M-cell-targeted mucosal vaccines."], ["The ITQ-37 mesoporous chiral zeolite", "The synthesis of crystalline molecular sieves with pore dimensions that fill the gap between microporous and mesoporous materials is a matter of fundamental and industrial interest(1-3). The preparation of zeolitic materials with extralarge pores and chiral frameworks would permit many new applications. Two important steps in this direction include the synthesis(4) of ITQ-33, a stable zeolite with 18 x 10 x 10 ring windows, and the synthesis(5) of SU-32, which has an intrinsically chiral zeolite structure and where each crystal exhibits only one handedness. Here we present a germanosilicate zeolite (ITQ-37) with extralarge 30-ring windows. Its structure was determined by combining selected area electron diffraction ( SAED) and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) in a charge-flipping algorithm(6). The framework follows the SrSi2 (srs) minimal net(7) and forms two unique cavities, each of which is connected to three other cavities to form a gyroidal channel system. These cavities comprise the enantiomorphous srs net of the framework. ITQ-37 is the first chiral zeolite with one single gyroidal channel. It has the lowest framework density (10.3 T atoms per 1,000 angstrom(3)) of all existing 4-coordinated crystalline oxide frameworks, and the pore volume of the corresponding silica polymorph would be 0.38 cm(3) g(-1)."], ["Electrolytic deuteration of unsaturated bonds without using D2", "Site-selective deuteration of C\u2013H bonds increases the lifetime and efficacy of drug molecules. Although effective methods to form C(sp2)\u2013D bonds are known, processes for making C(sp3)\u2013D bonds often have low site selectivity, require expensive and unrecoverable D2 gas, or use stoichiometric reagents. Here we report cost-efficient and site-selective reductive deuteration using a tandem electrochemical chemical palladium membrane reactor. This architecture mediates the chemical reaction of deuterium atoms (derived from reusable D2O in an electrochemical compartment) with alkynes, aldehydes and imines. The formation of C(sp3)\u2013D and C(sp2)\u2013D bonds in the isolated chemical compartment is made possible by the deuterium-selective permeability of the membrane that partitions the electrochemical compartment from the chemical compartment. We have utilized the reactor for the deuteration step in the construction of a common drug, cinacalcet, to demonstrate that this method can be used to incorporate deuterium atoms in a pharmaceutical."], ["CDK4/6 inhibition triggers anti-tumour immunity", "Cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) are fundamental drivers of the cell cycle and are required for the initiation and progression of various malignancies(1,2). Pharmacological inhibitors of CDK4/6 have shown significant activity against several solid tumours(3,4). Their primary mechanism of action is thought to be the inhibition of phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma tumour suppressor, inducing G1 cell cycle arrest in tumour cells(5). Here we use mouse models of breast carcinoma and other solid tumours to show that selective CDK4/6 inhibitors not only induce tumour cell cycle arrest, but also promote anti-tumour immunity. We confirm this phenomenon through transcriptomic analysis of serial biopsies from a clinical trial of CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment for breast cancer. The enhanced antitumour immune response has two underpinnings. First, CDK4/6 inhibitors activate tumour cell expression of endogenous retroviral elements, thus increasing intracellular levels of double-stranded RNA. This in turn stimulates production of type III interferons and hence enhances tumour antigen presentation. Second, CDK4/6 inhibitors markedly suppress the proliferation of regulatory T cells. Mechanistically, the effects of CDK4/6 inhibitors both on tumour cells and on regulatory T cells are associated with reduced activity of the E2F target, DNA methyltransferase 1. Ultimately, these events promote cytotoxic T-cell-mediated clearance of tumour cells, which is further enhanced by the addition of immune checkpoint blockade. Our findings indicate that CDK4/6 inhibitors increase tumour immunogenicity and provide a rationale for new combination regimens comprising CDK4/6 inhibitors and immunotherapies as anti-cancer treatment."], ["Preservation of organic matter in sediments promoted by iron", "The biogeochemical cycles of iron and organic carbon are strongly interlinked. In oceanic waters, organic ligands have been shown to control the concentration of dissolved iron(1). In soils, solid iron phases shelter and preserve organic carbon(2), but the role of iron in the preservation of organic matter in sediments has not been clearly established. Here we use an iron reduction method previously applied to soils(3) to determine the amount of organic carbon associated with reactive iron phases in sediments of various mineralogies collected from a wide range of depositional environments. Our findings suggest that 21.5 +/- 8.6 per cent of the organic carbon in sediments is directly bound to reactive iron phases. We further estimate that a global mass of (19-45) x 10(15) grams of organic carbon is preserved in surface marine sediments as a result of its association with iron(4). We propose that these associations between organic carbon and iron, which are formed primarily through co-precipitation and/or direct chelation, promote the preservation of organic carbon in sediments. Because reactive iron phases are metastable over geological timescales, we suggest that they serve as an efficient 'rusty sink' for organic carbon, acting as a key factor in the long-term storage of organic carbon and thus contributing to the global cycles of carbon, oxygen and sulphur(5)."], ["Ion-induced nucleation of pure biogenic particles", "Atmospheric aerosols and their effect on clouds are thought to be important for anthropogenic radiative forcing of the climate, yet remain poorly understood(1). Globally, around half of cloud condensation nuclei originate from nucleation of atmospheric vapours(2). It is thought that sulfuric acid is essential to initiate most particle formation in the atmosphere(3,4), and that ions have a relatively minor role(5). Some laboratory studies, however, have reported organic particle formation without the intentional addition of sulfuric acid, although contamination could not be excluded(6,7). Here we present evidence for the formation of aerosol particles from highly oxidized biogenic vapours in the absence of sulfuric acid in a large chamber under atmospheric conditions. The highly oxygenated molecules (HOMs) are produced by ozonolysis of a-pinene. We find that ions from Galactic cosmic rays increase the nucleation rate by one to two orders of magnitude compared with neutral nucleation. Our experimental findings are supported by quantum chemical calculations of the cluster binding energies of representative HOMs. Ion-induced nucleation of pure organic particles constitutes a potentially widespread source of aerosol particles in terrestrial environments with low sulfuric acid pollution."], ["Transport evidence for Fermi-arc-mediated chirality transfer in the Dirac semimetal Cd<sub>3</sub>As<sub>2</sub>", "The dispersion of charge carriers in a metal is distinctly different from that of free electrons owing to their interactions with the crystal lattice. These interactions may lead to quasiparticles mimicking the massless relativistic dynamics of high-energy particle physics(1-3), and they can twist the quantum phase of electrons into topologically non-trivial knots-producing protected surface states with anomalous electromagnetic properties(4-9). These effects intertwine in materials known as Weyl semimetals, and in their crystal-symmetry-protected analogues, Dirac semimetals(10). The latter show a linear electronic dispersion in three dimensions described by two copies of the Weyl equation (a theoretical description of massless relativistic fermions). At the surface of a crystal, the broken translational symmetry creates topological surface states, so-called Fermi arcs(11), which have no counterparts in high-energy physics or conventional condensed matter systems. Here we present Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in focused-ion-beam-prepared microstructures of Cd3As2 that are consistent with the theoretically predicted 'Weyl orbits', a kind of cyclotron motion that weaves together Fermi-arc and chiral bulk states(12). In contrast to conventional cyclotron orbits, this motion is driven by the transfer of chirality from one Weyl node to another, rather than momentum transfer of the Lorentz force. Our observations provide evidence for direct access to the topological properties of charge in a transport experiment, a first step towards their potential application."], ["Thermochemical structures beneath Africa and the Pacific Ocean", "Large low-velocity seismic anomalies have been detected in the Earth's lower mantle beneath Africa and the Pacific Ocean that are not easily explained by temperature variations alone(1-11). The African anomaly has been interpreted to be a northwest southeast-trending structure(3-5,7) with a sharp-edged linear, ridgelike morphology(9,10). The Pacific anomaly, on the other hand, appears to be more rounded in shape(1-4,6,7,11). Mantle models with heterogeneous composition have related these structures to dense thermochemical piles or superplumes(12-19). It has not been shown, however, that such models can lead to thermochemical structures that satisfy the geometrical constraints, as inferred from seismological observations. Here we present numerical models of thermochemical convection in a three-dimensional spherical geometry using plate velocities inferred for the past 119 million years(20). We show that Earth's subduction history can lead to thermochemical structures similar in shape to the observed large, lower-mantle velocity anomalies. We find that subduction history tends to focus dense material into a ridge-like pile beneath Africa and a relatively more-rounded pile under the Pacific Ocean, consistent with seismic observations."], ["Maximized electron interactions at the magic angle in twisted bilayer graphene", "The electronic properties of heterostructures of atomically thin van der Waals crystals can be modified substantially by moire superlattice potentials from an interlayer twist between crystals(1,2). Moire tuning of the band structure has led to the recent discovery of superconductivity(3,4) and correlated insulating phases5 in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) near the 'magic angle' of twist of about 1.1 degrees, with a phase diagram reminiscent of high-transition-temperature superconductors. Here we directly map the atomic-scale structural and electronic properties of TBG near the magic angle using scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy. We observe two distinct van Hove singularities (VHSs) in the local density of states around the magic angle, with an energy separation of 57 millielectronvolts that drops to 40 millielectronvolts with high electron/hole doping. Unexpectedly, the VHS energy separation continues to decrease with decreasing twist angle, with a lowest value of 7 to 13 millielectronvolts at a magic angle of 0.79 degrees. More crucial to the correlated behaviour of this material, we find that at the magic angle, the ratio of the Coulomb interaction to the bandwidth of each individual VHS (U/t) is maximized, which is optimal for electronic Cooper pairing mechanisms. When doped near the half-moire-band filling, a correlation-induced gap splits the conduction VHS with a maximum size of 6.5 millielectronvolts at 1.15 degrees, dropping to 4 millielectronvolts at 0.79 degrees. We capture the doping-dependent and angle-dependent spectroscopy results using a Hartree-Fock model, which allows us to extract the on-site and nearest-neighbour Coulomb interactions. This analysis yields a U/t of order unity indicating that magic-angle TBG is moderately correlated. In addition, scanning tunnelling spectroscopy maps reveal an energy-and doping-dependent threefold rotational-symmetry breaking of the local density of states in TBG, with the strongest symmetry breaking near the Fermi level and further enhanced when doped to the correlated gap regime. This indicates the presence of a strong electronic nematic susceptibility or even nematic order in TBG in regions of the phase diagram where superconductivity is observed."], ["Photoredox-Mediated Net-Neutral Radical/Polar Crossover Reactions", "Radical/Polar Crossover (RPC) chemistry is a rapidly growing subset of photoredox catalysis that is characterized by transformations featuring both radical and ionic modes of reactivity. Net-neutral RPC is particularly interesting in that both the single-electron oxidation and reduction steps occur through interaction with the photocatalyst, thus precluding the need for exogenous oxidants or reductants. As such, these transformations facilitate rapid incorporation of molecular complexity while maintaining mild reaction conditions. This review covers recent advances in photoredox-mediated net-neutral RPC synthetic methods, with a particular emphasis on C\u2013C bond-forming reactions."], ["Earliest date for milk use in the Near East and southeastern Europe linked to cattle herding", "The domestication of cattle, sheep and goats had already taken place in the Near East by the eighth millennium BC(1-3). Although there would have been considerable economic and nutritional gains from using these animals for their milk and other products from living animals - that is, traction and wool - the first clear evidence for these appears much later, from the late fifth and fourth millennia BC(4,5). Hence, the timing and region in which milking was first practised remain unknown. Organic residues preserved in archaeological pottery(6,7) have provided direct evidence for the use of milk in the fourth millennium in Britain(7-9), and in the sixth millennium in eastern Europe(10), based on the delta(13)C values of the major fatty acids of milk fat(6,7). Here we apply this approach to more than 2,200 pottery vessels from sites in the Near East and southeastern Europe dating from the fifth to the seventh millennia BC. We show that milk was in use by the seventh millennium; this is the earliest direct evidence to date. Milking was particularly important in northwestern Anatolia, pointing to regional differences linked with conditions more favourable to cattle compared to other regions, where sheep and goats were relatively common and milk use less important. The latter is supported by correlations between the fat type and animal bone evidence."], ["Ultraflat graphene", "Graphene, a single atomic layer of carbon connected by sp(2) hybridized bonds, has attracted intense scientific interest since its recent discovery(1). Much of the research on graphene has been directed towards exploration of its novel electronic properties, but the structural aspects of this model two-dimensional system are also of great interest and importance. In particular, microscopic corrugations have been observed on all suspended(2) and supported(3-8) graphene sheets studied so far. This rippling has been invoked to explain the thermodynamic stability of free-standing graphene sheets(9). Many distinctive electronic(10-12) and chemical(13-15) properties of graphene have been attributed to the presence of ripples, which are also predicted to give rise to new physical phenomena(16-26) that would be absent in a planar two-dimensional material. Direct experimental study of such novel ripple physics has, however, been hindered by the lack of flat graphene layers. Here we demonstrate the fabrication of graphene monolayers that are flat down to the atomic level. These samples are produced by deposition on the atomically flat terraces of cleaved mica surfaces. The apparent height variation in the graphene layers observed by high-resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM) is less than 25 picometres, indicating the suppression of any existing intrinsic ripples in graphene. The availability of such ultraflat samples will permit rigorous testing of the impact of ripples on various physical and chemical properties of graphene."], ["Potent neutralizing antibodies against multiple epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 spike", "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic continues, with devasting consequences for human lives and the global economy(1,2). The discovery and development of virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies could be one approach to treat or prevent infection by this coronavirus. Here we report the isolation of sixty-one SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from five patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and admitted to hospital with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Among these are nineteen antibodies that potently neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, nine of which exhibited very high potency, with 50% virus-inhibitory concentrations of 0.7 to 9 ng ml(-1). Epitope mapping showed that this collection of nineteen antibodies was about equally divided between those directed against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and those directed against the N-terminal domain (NTD), indicating that both of these regions at the top of the viral spike are immunogenic. In addition, two other powerful neutralizing antibodies recognized quaternary epitopes that overlap with the domains at the top of the spike. Cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of one antibody that targets the RBD, a second that targets the NTD, and a third that bridges two separate RBDs showed that the antibodies recognize the closed, 'all RBD-down' conformation of the spike. Several of these monoclonal antibodies are promising candidates for clinical development as potential therapeutic and/or prophylactic agents against SARS-CoV-2. A diverse collection of potent neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein have been isolated from five patients with severe COVID-19 and high serum neutralization titres."], ["Gelation of particles with short-range attraction", "Nanoscale or colloidal particles are important in many realms of science and technology. They can dramatically change the properties of materials, imparting solid-like behaviour to a wide variety of complex fluids(1,2). This behaviour arises when particles aggregate to form mesoscopic clusters and networks. The essential component leading to aggregation is an interparticle attraction, which can be generated by many physical and chemical mechanisms. In the limit of irreversible aggregation, infinitely strong interparticle bonds lead to diffusion-limited cluster aggregation(3) (DLCA). This is understood as a purely kinetic phenomenon that can form solid-like gels at arbitrarily low particle volume fraction(4,5). Far more important technologically are systems with weaker attractions, where gel formation requires higher volume fractions. Numerous scenarios for gelation have been proposed, including DLCA(6), kinetic or dynamic arrest(4,7-10), phase separation(5,6,11-16), percolation(4,12,17,18) and jamming(8). No consensus has emerged and, despite its ubiquity and significance, gelation is far from understood-even the location of the gelation phase boundary is not agreed on(5). Here we report experiments showing that gelation of spherical particles with isotropic, short-range attractions is initiated by spinodal decomposition; this thermodynamic instability triggers the formation of density fluctuations, leading to spanning clusters that dynamically arrest to create a gel. This simple picture of gelation does not depend on microscopic system-specific details, and should thus apply broadly to any particle system with short- range attractions. Our results suggest that gelation-often considered a purely kinetic phenomenon(4,8-10)-is in fact a direct consequence of equilibrium liquid gas phase separation(5,13-15). Without exception, we observe gelation in all of our samples predicted by theory and simulation to phaseseparate; this suggests that it is phase separation, not percolation(12), that corresponds to gelation in models for attractive spheres."], ["Printable organometallic perovskite enables large-area, low-dose X-ray imaging", "Medical X-ray imaging procedures require digital flat detectors operating at low doses to reduce radiation health risks(1,2). Solutionprocessed organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites have characteristics that make them good candidates for the photoconductive layer of such sensitive detectors(3-7). However, such detectors have not yet been built on thin-film transistor arrays because it has been difficult to prepare thick perovskite films (more than a few hundred micrometres) over large areas (a detector is typically 50 centimetres by 50 centimetres). We report here an all-solutionbased (in contrast to conventional vacuum processing) synthetic route to producing printable polycrystalline perovskites with sharply faceted large grains having morphologies and optoelectronic properties comparable to those of single crystals. High sensitivities of up to 11 microcoulombs per air KERMA of milligray per square centimetre (mu C mGyair(-1) cm(-2)) are achieved under irradiation with a 100-kilovolt bremsstrahlung source, which are at least one order of magnitude higher than the sensitivities achieved with currently used amorphous selenium or thallium-doped cesium iodide detectors. We demonstrate X-ray imaging in a conventional thin-film transistor substrate by embedding an 830-micrometrethick perovskite film and an additional two interlayers of polymer/perovskite composites to provide conformal interfaces between perovskite films and electrodes that control dark currents and temporal charge carrier transportation. Such an all-solution-based perovskite detector could enable low-dose X-ray imaging, and could also be used in photoconductive devices for radiation imaging, sensing and energy harvesting."], ["Intrinsic retroviral reactivation in human preimplantation embryos and pluripotent cells", "Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are remnants of ancient retroviral infections, and comprise nearly 8% of the human genome(1). The most recently acquired human ERV is HERVK(HML-2), which repeatedly infected the primate lineage both before and after the divergence of the human and chimpanzee common ancestor(2,3). Unlike most other human ERVs, HERVK retained multiple copies of intact open reading frames encoding retroviral proteins(4). However, HERVK is transcriptionally silenced by the host, with the exception of in certain pathological contexts such as germ-cell tumours, melanoma or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection(5-7). Here we demonstrate that DNA hypomethylation at long terminal repeat elements representing the most recent genomic integrations, together with transactivation by OCT4 (also known as POU5F1), synergistically facilitate HERVK expression. Consequently, HERVK is transcribed during normal human embryogenesis, beginning with embryonic genome activation at the eight-cell stage, continuing through the emergence of epiblast cells in preimplantation blastocysts, and ceasing during human embryonic stem cell derivation from blastocyst outgrowths. Remarkably, we detected HERVK viral-like particles and Gag proteins in human blastocysts, indicating that early human development proceeds in the presence of retroviral products. We further show that overexpression of one such product, the HERVK accessory protein Rec, in a pluripotent cell line is sufficient to increase IFITM1 levels on the cell surface and inhibit viral infection, suggesting at least one mechanism through which HERVK can induce viral restriction pathways in early embryonic cells. Moreover, Rec directly binds a subset of cellular RNAs and modulates their ribosome occupancy, indicating that complex interactions between retroviral proteins and host factors can fine-tune pathways of early human development."], ["HDAC8 mutations in Cornelia de Lange syndrome affect the cohesin acetylation cycle", "Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a dominantly inherited congenital malformation disorder, caused by mutations in the cohesin-loading protein NIPBL1,2 for nearly 60% of individuals with classical CdLS3-5, and by mutations in the core cohesin components SMC1A (similar to 5%) and SMC3 (<1%) for a smaller fraction of probands(6,7). In humans, the multisubunit complex cohesin is made up of SMC1, SMC3, RAD21 and a STAG protein. These form a ring structure that is proposed to encircle sister chromatids to mediate sister chromatid cohesion(8) and also has key roles in gene regulation(9). SMC3 is acetylated during S-phase to establish cohesiveness of chromatin-loaded cohesin(10-13), and in yeast, the class I histone deacetylase Hos1 deacetylates SMC3 during anaphase(14-16). Here we identify HDAC8 as the vertebrate SMC3 deacetylase, as well as loss-of-function HDAC8 mutations in six CdLS probands. Loss of HDAC8 activity results in increased SMC3 acetylation and inefficient dissolution of the 'used' cohesin complex released from chromatin in both prophase and anaphase. SMC3 with retained acetylation is loaded onto chromatin, and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis demonstrates decreased occupancy of cohesin localization sites that results in a consistent pattern of altered transcription seen in CdLS cell lines with either NIPBL or HDAC8 mutations."], ["Main-group elements as transition metals", "The last quarter of the twentieth century and the beginning decade of the twenty-first witnessed spectacular discoveries in the chemistry of the heavier main-group elements. The new compounds that were synthesized highlighted the fundamental differences between their electronic properties and those of the lighter elements to a degree that was not previously apparent. This has led to new structural and bonding insights as well as a gradually increasing realization that the chemistry of the heavier main-group elements more resembles that of transition-metal complexes than that of their lighter main-group congeners. The similarity is underlined by recent work, which has shown that many of the new compounds react with small molecules such as H-2, NH3, C2H4 or CO under mild conditions and display potential for applications in catalysis."], ["BAX activation is initiated at a novel interaction site", "BAX is a pro- apoptotic protein of the BCL- 2 family that is stationed in the cytosol until activated by a diversity of stress stimuli to induce cell death. Anti- apoptotic proteins such as BCL- 2 counteract BAX- mediated cell death. Although an interaction site that confers survival functionality has been defined for anti- apoptotic proteins, an activation site has not been identified for BAX, rendering its explicit trigger mechanism unknown. We previously developed stabilized alpha- helix of BCL- 2 domains ( SAHBs) that directly initiate BAX- mediated mitochondrial apoptosis. Here we demonstrate by NMR analysis that BIM SAHB binds BAX at an interaction site that is distinct from the canonical binding groove characterized for anti- apoptotic proteins. The specificity of the human BIM- SAHB - BAX interaction is highlighted by point mutagenesis that disrupts functional activity, confirming that BAX activation is initiated at this novel structural location. Thus, we have now defined a BAX interaction site for direct activation, establishing a new target for therapeutic modulation of apoptosis."], ["Technological Innovations in Photochemistry for Organic Synthesis: Flow Chemistry, High-Throughput Experimentation, Scale-up, and Photoelectrochemistry", "Photoinduced chemical transformations have received in recent years a tremendous amount of attention, providing a plethora of opportunities to synthetic organic chemists.

These challenges have barred the widespread adoption of photochemical steps in the chemical industry. However, in the past decade, several technological innovations have led to more reproducible, selective, and scalable photoinduced reactions. Herein, we provide a comprehensive overview of these exciting technological advances, including flow chemistry, high-throughput experimentation, reactor design and scale-up, and the combination of photo- and electro-chemistry."], ["CRISPR-guided DNA polymerases enable diversification of all nucleotides in a tunable window", "The capacity to diversify genetic codes advances our ability to understand and engineer biological systems(1,2). A method for continuously diversifying user-defined regions of a genome would enable forward genetic approaches in systems that are not amenable to efficient homology-directed oligonucleotide integration. It would also facilitate the rapid evolution of biotechnologically useful phenotypes through accelerated and parallelized rounds of mutagenesis and selection, as well as cell-lineage tracking through barcode mutagenesis. Here we present EvolvR, a system that can continuously diversify all nucleotides within a tunable window length at user-defined loci. This is achieved by directly generating mutations using engineered DNA polymerases targeted to loci via CRISPR-guided nickases. We identified nickase and polymerase variants that offer a range of targeted mutation rates that are up to 7,770,000-fold greater than rates seen in wild-type cells, and editing windows with lengths of up to 350 nucleotides. We used EvolvR to identify novel ribosomal mutations that confer resistance to the antibiotic spectinomycin. Our results demonstrate that CRISPR-guided DNA polymerases enable multiplexed and continuous diversification of user-defined genomic loci, which will be useful for a broad range of basic and biotechnological applications."], ["Learning the signatures of the human grasp using a scalable tactile glove", "Humans can feel, weigh and grasp diverse objects, and simultaneously infer their material properties while applying the right amount of force-a challenging set of tasks for a modern robot(1). Mechanoreceptor networks that provide sensory feedback and enable the dexterity of the human grasp(2) remain difficult to replicate in robots. Whereas computer-vision-based robot grasping strategies(3-5) have progressed substantially with the abundance of visual data and emerging machine-learning tools, there are as yet no equivalent sensing platforms and large-scale datasets with which to probe the use of the tactile information that humans rely on when grasping objects. Studying the mechanics of how humans grasp objects will complement vision-based robotic object handling. Importantly, the inability to record and analyse tactile signals currently limits our understanding of the role of tactile information in the human grasp itself-for example, how tactile maps are used to identify objects and infer their properties is unknown(6). Here we use a scalable tactile glove and deep convolutional neural networks to show that sensors uniformly distributed over the hand can be used to identify individual objects, estimate their weight and explore the typical tactile patterns that emerge while grasping objects. The sensor array (548 sensors) is assembled on a knitted glove, and consists of a piezoresistive film connected by a network of conductive thread electrodes that are passively probed. Using a low-cost (about US$10) scalable tactile glove sensor array, we record a large-scale tactile dataset with 135,000 frames, each covering the full hand, while interacting with 26 different objects. This set of interactions with different objects reveals the key correspondences between different regions of a human hand while it is manipulating objects. Insights from the tactile signatures of the human grasp-through the lens of an artificial analogue of the natural mechanoreceptor network-can thus aid the future design of prosthetics(7), robot grasping tools and human-robot interactions(1,8-10)."], ["Super-multiplex vibrational imaging", "The ability to visualize directly a large number of distinct molecular species inside cells is increasingly essential for understanding complex systems and processes. Even though existing methods have successfully been used to explore structure-function relationships in nervous systems, to profile RNA in situ, to reveal the heterogeneity of tumour microenvironments and to study dynamic macromolecular assembly(1-4), it remains challenging to image many species with high selectivity and sensitivity under biological conditions. For instance, fluorescence microscopy faces a 'colour barrier', owing to the intrinsically broad (about 1,500 inverse centimetres) and featureless nature of fluorescence spectra(5) that limits the number of resolvable colours to two to five (or seven to nine if using complicated instrumentation and analysis)(6-8). Spontaneous Raman microscopy probes vibrational transitions with much narrower resonances (peak width of about 10 inverse centimetres) and so does not suffer from this problem, but weak signals make many bio-imaging applications impossible. Although surface-enhanced Raman scattering offers high sensitivity and multiplicity, it cannot be readily used to image specific molecular targets quantitatively inside live cells(9). Here we use stimulated Raman scattering under electronic pre-resonance conditions to image target molecules inside living cells with very high vibrational selectivity and sensitivity (down to 250 nanomolar with a time constant of 1 millisecond). We create a palette of triple-bond-conjugated near-infrared dyes that each displays a single peak in the cell-silent Raman spectral window; when combined with available fluorescent probes, this palette provides 24 resolvable colours, with the potential for further expansion. Proof-of-principle experiments on neuronal co-cultures and brain tissues reveal cell-type-dependent heterogeneities in DNA and protein metabolism under physiological and pathological conditions, underscoring the potential of this 24-colour (super-multiplex) optical imaging approach for elucidating intricate interactions in complex biological systems."], ["Superconductivity at 250 K in lanthanum hydride under high pressures", "With the discovery(1) of superconductivity at 203 kelvin in H3S, attention returned to conventional superconductors with properties that can be described by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer and the Migdal-Eliashberg theories. Although these theories predict the possibility of room-temperature superconductivity in metals that have certain favourable properties-such as lattice vibrations at high frequencies-they are not sufficient to guide the design or predict the properties of new superconducting materials. First-principles calculations based on density functional theory have enabled such predictions, and have suggested a new family of superconducting hydrides that possess a clathrate-like structure in which the host atom (calcium, yttrium, lanthanum) is at the centre of a cage formed by hydrogen atoms(2-4). For LaH10 and YH10, the onset of superconductivity is predicted to occur at critical temperatures between 240 and 320 kelvin at megabar pressures(3-6). Here we report superconductivity with a critical temperature of around 250 kelvin within the Fm (3) over barm structure of LaH10 at a pressure of about 170 gigapascals. This is, to our knowledge, the highest critical temperature that has been confirmed so far in a superconducting material. Superconductivity was evidenced by the observation of zero resistance, an isotope effect, and a decrease in critical temperature under an external magnetic field, which suggested an upper critical magnetic field of about 136 tesla at zero temperature. The increase of around 50 kelvin compared with the previous highest critical temperature(1) is an encouraging step towards the goal of achieving room-temperature superconductivity in the near future."], ["A neurotransmitter produced by gut bacteria modulates host sensory behaviour", "A neuromodulator produced by commensalProvidenciabacteria that colonize the gut ofCaenorhabditis elegansmimics the functions of the cognate host molecule to manipulate a sensory decision of the host. Animals coexist in commensal, pathogenic or mutualistic relationships with complex communities of diverse organisms, including microorganisms(1). Some bacteria produce bioactive neurotransmitters that have previously been proposed to modulate nervous system activity and behaviours of their hosts(2,3). However, the mechanistic basis of this microbiota-brain signalling and its physiological relevance are largely unknown. Here we show that inCaenorhabditis elegans, the neuromodulator tyramine produced by commensalProvidenciabacteria, which colonize the gut, bypasses the requirement for host tyramine biosynthesis and manipulates a host sensory decision. Bacterially produced tyramine is probably converted to octopamine by the host tyramine beta-hydroxylase enzyme. Octopamine, in turn, targets the OCTR-1 octopamine receptor on ASH nociceptive neurons to modulate an aversive olfactory response. We identify the genes that are required for tyramine biosynthesis inProvidencia, and show that these genes are necessary for the modulation of host behaviour. We further find thatC. eleganscolonized byProvidenciapreferentially select these bacteria in food choice assays, and that this selection bias requires bacterially produced tyramine and host octopamine signalling. Our results demonstrate that a neurotransmitter produced by gut bacteria mimics the functions of the cognate host molecule to override host control of a sensory decision, and thereby promotes fitness of both the host and the microorganism."], ["Suppression of the coffee-ring effect by shape-dependent capillary interactions", "When a drop of liquid dries on a solid surface, its suspended particulate matter is deposited in ring-like fashion. This phenomenon, known as the coffee-ring effect(1-3), is familiar to anyone who has observed a drop of coffee dry. During the drying process, drop edges become pinned to the substrate, and capillary flow outward from the centre of the drop brings suspended particles to the edge as evaporation proceeds. After evaporation, suspended particles are left highly concentrated along the original drop edge. The coffee-ring effect is manifested in systems with diverse constituents, ranging from large colloids(1,4,5) to nanoparticles(6) and individual molecules(7). In fact-despite the many practical applications for uniform coatings in printing(8), biology(9,10) and complex assembly(11)-the ubiquitous nature of the effect has made it difficult to avoid(6,12-16). Here we show experimentally that the shape of the suspended particles is important and can be used to eliminate the coffee-ring effect: ellipsoidal particles are deposited uniformly during evaporation. The anisotropic shape of the particles significantly deforms interfaces, producing strong interparticle apillary interactions(17-23). Thus, after the ellipsoids are carried to the air-water interface by the same outward flow that causes the coffee-ring effect for spheres, strong long-ranged interparticle attractions between ellipsoids lead to the formation of loosely packed or arrested structures on the air-water interface(17,18,21,24). These structures prevent the suspended particles from reaching the drop edge and ensure uniform deposition. Interestingly, under appropriate conditions, suspensions of spheres mixed with a small number of ellipsoids also produce uniform deposition. Thus, particle shape provides a convenient parameter to control the deposition of particles, without modification of particle or solvent chemistry."], ["Bayesian reaction optimization as a tool for chemical synthesis", "Reaction optimization is fundamental to synthetic chemistry, from optimizing the yield of industrial processes to selecting conditions for the preparation of medicinal candidates(1). Likewise, parameter optimization is omnipresent in artificial intelligence, from tuning virtual personal assistants to training social media and product recommendation systems(2). Owing to the high cost associated with carrying out experiments, scientists in both areas set numerous (hyper)parameter values by evaluating only a small subset of the possible configurations. Bayesian optimization, an iterative response surface-based global optimization algorithm, has demonstrated exceptional performance in the tuning of machine learning models(3). Bayesian optimization has also been recently applied in chemistry(4-9); however, its application and assessment for reaction optimization in synthetic chemistry has not been investigated. Here we report the development of a framework for Bayesian reaction optimization and an open-source software tool that allows chemists to easily integrate state-of-the-art optimization algorithms into their everyday laboratory practices. We collect a large benchmark dataset for a palladium-catalysed direct arylation reaction, perform a systematic study of Bayesian optimization compared to human decision-making in reaction optimization, and apply Bayesian optimization to two real-world optimization efforts (Mitsunobu and deoxyfluorination reactions). Benchmarking is accomplished via an online game that links the decisions made by expert chemists and engineers to real experiments run in the laboratory. Our findings demonstrate that Bayesian optimization outperforms human decisionmaking in both average optimization efficiency (number of experiments) and consistency (variance of outcome against initially available data). Overall, our studies suggest that adopting Bayesian optimization methods into everyday laboratory practices could facilitate more efficient synthesis of functional chemicals by enabling better-informed, data-driven decisions about which experiments to run."], ["Phase-contrast imaging using polychromatic hard X-rays", "IN conventional radiography, X-rays which pass through an object along different paths are differentially absorbed, and the intensity pattern of the emerging beam records the distribution of absorbing materials within the sample. An alternative approach is phase-contrast radiography, which instead records variations of the phase of the emerging radiation. Such an approach offers improved contrast sensitivity, especially when imaging weakly absorbing samples. Unfortunately, current phase-contrast imaging techniques(1-11) generally require highly monochromatic planewave radiation and sophisticated X-ray optics, so their use is greatly restricted. Here we describe and demonstrate a simplified scheme for phase-contrast imaging based on an X-ray source having high spatial (but essentially no chromatic) coherence. The method is compatible with conventional polychromatic microfocus X-ray tube sources, is well suited to large areas of irradiation, can operate with a lower absorbed dose than traditional X-ray imaging techniques, and should find broad application in clinical, biological and industrial settings."], ["Structure and function of an irreversible agonist-\u03b2<sub>2</sub> adrenoceptor complex", "G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are eukaryotic integral membrane proteins that modulate biological function by initiating cellular signalling in response to chemically diverse agonists. Despite recent progress in the structural biology of GPCRs(1), the molecular basis for agonist binding and allosteric modulation of these proteins is poorly understood. Structural knowledge of agonist-bound states is essential for deciphering the mechanism of receptor activation, and for structure-guided design and optimization of ligands. However, the crystallization of agonist-bound GPCRs has been hampered by modest affinities and rapid off-rates of available agonists. Using the inactive structure of the human beta(2) adrenergic receptor (beta(2)AR) as a guide, we designed a beta(2)AR agonist that can be covalently tethered to a specific site on the receptor through a disulphide bond. The covalent beta(2)AR-agonist complex forms efficiently, and is capable of activating a heterotrimeric G protein. We crystallized a covalent agonist-bound beta(2)AR-T4L fusion protein in lipid bilayers through the use of the lipidic mesophase method(2), and determined its structure at 3.5 angstrom resolution. A comparison to the inactive structure and an antibody-stabilized active structure (companion paper(3)) shows how binding events at both the extracellular and intracellular surfaces are required to stabilize an active conformation of the receptor. The structures are in agreement with long-timescale (up to 30 mu s) molecular dynamics simulations showing that an agonist-bound active conformation spontaneously relaxes to an inactive-like conformation in the absence of a G protein or stabilizing antibody."], ["Accurate <i>de novo</i> design of hyperstable constrained peptides", "Naturally occurring, pharmacologically active peptides constrained with covalent crosslinks generally have shapes that have evolved to fit precisely into binding pockets on their targets. Such peptides can have excellent pharmaceutical properties, combining the stability and tissue penetration of small-molecule drugs with the specificity of much larger protein therapeutics. The ability to design constrained peptides with precisely specified tertiary structures would enable the design of shape-complementary inhibitors of arbitrary targets. Here we describe the development of computational methods for accurate de novo design of conformationally restricted peptides, and the use of these methods to design 18-47 residue, disulfide-crosslinked peptides, a subset of which are heterochiral and/or N-C backbone-cyclized. Both genetically encodable and non-canonical peptides are exceptionally stable to thermal and chemical denaturation, and 12 experimentally determined X-ray and NMR structures are nearly identical to the computational design models.

Identifying FVEs that have analyte specificity remains a challenge, owing to difficulties in generating polymers with sufficient diversity to enable screening of their properties. Here we describe a diversity-oriented synthetic strategy for microporous polymer membranes to identify candidates featuring FVEs that serve as solvation cages for lithium ions (Li+). This strategy includes diversification of bis(catechol) monomers by Mannich reactions to introduce Li+-coordinating functionality within FVEs, topology-enforcing polymerizations for networking FVEs into different pore architectures, and several on-polymer reactions for diversifying pore geometries and dielectric properties. The most promising candidate membranes featuring ion solvation cages exhibited both higher ionic conductivity and higher cation transference number than control membranes, in which FVEs were aspecific, indicating that conventional bounds for membrane permeability and selectivity for ion transport can be overcome(4). These advantages are associated with enhanced Li+ partitioning from the electrolyte when cages are present, higher diffusion barriers for anions within pores, and network-enforced restrictions on Li+ coordination number compared to the bulk electrolyte, which reduces the effective mass of the working ion. Such membranes show promise as anode-stabilizing interlayers in high-voltage lithium metal batteries."], ["Implementation of a quantum search algorithm on a quantum computer", "In 1982 Feynman(1) observed that quantum-mechanical systems have an information-processing capability much greater than that of corresponding classical systems, and could thus potentially be used to implement a new type of powerful computer. Three years later Deutsch(2) described a quantum-mechanical Turing machine, showing that quantum computers could indeed be constructed. Since then there has been extensive research in this field, but although the theory is fairly well understood, actually building a quantum computer has proved extremely difficult. Only two methods have been used to demonstrate quantum logic gates: ion traps(3,4) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)(5,6). NMR quantum computers have recently been used to solve a simple [GRAPHICS] quantum algorithm-the two-bit Deutsch problem(7,8). Here we show experimentally that such a computer can be used to implement a non-trivial fast quantum search algorithm initially developed by Grover(9,10), which can be conducted faster than a comparable search on a classical computer."], ["Practical and innate carbon-hydrogen functionalization of heterocycles", "Nitrogen-rich heterocyclic compounds have had a profound effect on human health because these chemical motifs are found in a large number of drugs used to combat a broad range of diseases and pathophysiological conditions. Advances in transition-metal-mediated cross-coupling have simplified the synthesis of such molecules; however, C-H functionalization of medicinally important heterocycles that does not rely on pre-functionalized starting materials is an underdeveloped area(1-9). Unfortunately, the innate properties of heterocycles that make them so desirable for biological applications-such as aqueous solubility and their ability to act as ligands-render them challenging substrates for direct chemical functionalization. Here we report that zinc sulphinate salts can be used to transfer alkyl radicals to heterocycles, allowing for the mild (moderate temperature, 50 degrees C or less), direct and operationally simple formation of medicinally relevant C-C bonds while reacting in a complementary fashion to other innate C-H functionalization methods(2-6) (Minisci, borono-Minisci, electrophilic aromatic substitution, transition-metal-mediated C-H insertion and C-H deprotonation). We prepared a toolkit of these reagents and studied their reactivity across a wide range of heterocycles (natural products, drugs and building blocks) without recourse to protecting-group chemistry. The reagents can even be used in tandem fashion in a single pot in the presence of water and air."], ["A review of radiation-grafted polymer electrolyte membranes for alkaline polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells", "The past two decades have witnessed many efforts to develop radiation-grafted alkaline membranes for alkaline PEM fuel cell applications, as such membranes have certain advantages over other kinds of alkaline membranes, including well-controlled composition, functionality, and other promising properties. To facilitate research and development in this area, the present paper reviews radiation-grafted alkaline membranes. We examine their synthesis/fabrication/characterization, membrane material selection, and theoretical approaches for fundamental understanding. We also present detailed examinations of their application in fuel cell in terms of the working principles of the radiation grafting process, the fabrication of MEAs using radiation-grafted membranes, the membranes' corresponding performance in alkaline PEM fuel cells, as well as performance optimization. The paper also summarizes the challenges and mitigation strategies for radiation-grafted alkaline membranes and their application in PEM fuel cells, presenting an overall picture of the technology as it presently stands."], ["New genetic loci link adipose and insulin biology to body fat distribution", "Body fat distribution is a heritable trait and a well-established predictor of adverse metabolic outcomes, independent of overall adiposity. To increase our understanding of the genetic basis of body fat distribution and its molecular links to cardiometabolic traits, here we conduct genome-wide association meta-analyses of traits related to waist and hip circumferences in up to 224,459 individuals. We identify 49 loci (33 new) associated with waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for body mass index (BMI), and an additional 19 loci newly associated with related waist and hip circumference measures (P < 5 x 10(-8)). In total, 20 of the 49 waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI loci show significant sexual dimorphism, 19 of which display a stronger effect in women. The identified loci were enriched for genes expressed in adipose tissue and for putative regulatory elements in adipocytes. Pathway analyses implicated adipogenesis, angiogenesis, transcriptional regulation and insulin resistance as processes affecting fat distribution, providing insight into potential pathophysiological mechanisms."], ["Science and technology for water purification in the coming decades", "One of the most pervasive problems afflicting people throughout the world is inadequate access to clean water and sanitation. Problems with water are expected to grow worse in the coming decades, with water scarcity occurring globally, even in regions currently considered water- rich. Addressing these problems calls out for a tremendous amount of research to be conducted to identify robust new methods of purifying water at lower cost and with less energy, while at the same time minimizing the use of chemicals and impact on the environment. Here we highlight some of the science and technology being developed to improve the disinfection and decontamination of water, as well as efforts to increase water supplies through the safe re- use of wastewater and efficient desalination of sea and brackish water."], ["Addition of nanoparticle dispersions to enhance flux pinning of the YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7-<i>x</i></sub> superconductor", "Following the discovery of type-II high-temperature superconductors in 1986 (refs 1, 2), work has proceeded to develop these materials for power applications. One of the problems, however, has been that magnetic flux is not completely expelled, but rather is contained within magnetic fluxons, whose motion prevents larger supercurrents. It is known that the critical current of these materials can be enhanced by incorporating a high density of extended defects to act as pinning centres for the fluxons(3,4). YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO or 123) is the most promising material for such applications at higher temperatures ( liquid nitrogen) 3-13. Pinning is optimized when the size of the defects approaches the superconducting coherence length (similar to2-4 nm for YBCO at temperatures less than or equal to77 K) and when the areal number density of defects is of the order of (H/2) x 10(11) cm(-2), where H is the applied magnetic field in tesla(3,4). Such a high density has been difficult to achieve by material-processing methods that maintain a nanosize defect, except through irradiation(5). Here we report a method for achieving a dispersion of similar to8-nm-sized nanoparticles in YBCO with a high number density, which increases the critical current ( at 77 K) by a factor of two to three for high magnetic fields."], ["Increase in tropospheric nitrogen dioxide over China observed from space", "Emissions from fossil fuel combustion and biomass burning reduce local air quality and affect global tropospheric chemistry. Nitrogen oxides are emitted by all combustion processes and play a key part in the photochemically induced catalytic production of ozone, which results in summer smog and has increased levels of tropospheric ozone globally(1). Release of nitrogen oxide also results in nitric acid deposition, and - at least locally - increases radiative forcing effects due to the absorption of downward propagating visible light(2). Nitrogen oxide concentrations in many industrialized countries are expected to decrease(3), but rapid economic development has the potential to increase significantly the emissions of nitrogen oxides(4-7) in parts of Asia. Here we present the tropospheric column amounts of nitrogen dioxide retrieved from two satellite instruments GOME(8,9) and SCIAMACHY(10) over the years 1996 - 2004. We find substantial reductions in nitrogen dioxide concentrations over some areas of Europe and the USA, but a highly significant increase of about 50 per cent - with an accelerating trend in annual growth rate - over the industrial areas of China, more than recent bottom-up inventories suggest(6)."], ["Wafer-scale single-crystal hexagonal boron nitride monolayers on Cu (111)", "The epitaxial growth of single-crystal hexagonal boron nitride monolayers on a copper (111) thin film across a sapphire wafer suggests a route to the broad adoption of two-dimensional layered semiconductor materials in industry. Ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) semiconducting layered materials offer great potential for extending Moore's law of the number of transistors in an integrated circuit(1). One key challenge with 2D semiconductors is to avoid the formation of charge scattering and trap sites from adjacent dielectrics. An insulating van der Waals layer of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) provides an excellent interface dielectric, efficiently reducing charge scattering(2,3). Recent studies have shown the growth of single-crystal hBN films on molten gold surfaces(4) or bulk copper foils(5). However, the use of molten gold is not favoured by industry, owing to its high cost, cross-contamination and potential issues of process control and scalability. Copper foils might be suitable for roll-to-roll processes, but are unlikely to be compatible with advanced microelectronic fabrication on wafers. Thus, a reliable way of growing single-crystal hBN films directly on wafers would contribute to the broad adoption of 2D layered materials in industry. Previous attempts to grow hBN monolayers on Cu (111) metals have failed to achieve mono-orientation, resulting in unwanted grain boundaries when the layers merge into films(6,7). Growing single-crystal hBN on such high-symmetry surface planes as Cu (111)(5,8) is widely believed to be impossible, even in theory. Nonetheless, here we report the successful epitaxial growth of single-crystal hBN monolayers on a Cu (111) thin film across a two-inch c-plane sapphire wafer. This surprising result is corroborated by our first-principles calculations, suggesting that the epitaxial growth is enhanced by lateral docking of hBN to Cu (111) steps, ensuring the mono-orientation of hBN monolayers. The obtained single-crystal hBN, incorporated as an interface layer between molybdenum disulfide and hafnium dioxide in a bottom-gate configuration, enhanced the electrical performance of transistors. This reliable approach to producing wafer-scale single-crystal hBN paves the way to future 2D electronics."], ["Pd(II)-Catalyzed Enantioselective C(sp3)\u2013H Arylation of Free Carboxylic Acids", "A monoprotected aminoethyl amine chiral ligand based on an ethylenediamine backbone was developed to achieve Pd-catalyzed enantioselective C(sp3)\u2013H arylation of cyclopropanecarboxylic and 2-aminoisobutyric acids without using exogenous directing groups.

Its ability to cleave a wide range of RNA targets with high selectivity entails a substantial therapeutic and biotechnological potential(2). However, the high expectations have not yet been met, a fact that coincides with the lack of high-resolution and time-resolved information about its mode of action(3). Here we provide high-resolution NMR characterization of all apparent states ofthe prototypic 10-23 DNAzyme and present a comprehensive survey ofthe kinetics and dynamics of its catalytic function. The determined structure and identified metal-ion-binding sites ofthe precatalytic DNAzyme-RNA complex reveal that the basis ofthe DNA-mediated catalysis is an interplay among three factors: an unexpected, yet exciting molecular architecture; distinct conformational plasticity; and dynamic modulation by metal ions. We further identify previously hidden rate-limiting transient intermediate states in the DNA-mediated catalytic processvia real-time NMR measurements. Using a rationally selected single-atom replacement, we could considerably enhance the performance ofthe DNAzyme, demonstrating that the acquired knowledge ofthe molecular structure, its plasticity and the occurrence of long-lived intermediate states constitutes a valuable starting point for the rational design of next-generation DNAzymes."], ["Chromosome conformation elucidates regulatory relationships in developing human brain", "Three-dimensional physical interactions within chromosomes dynamically regulate gene expression in a tissue-specific manner(1-3).

Here we generate high-resolution 3D maps of chromatin contacts during human corticogenesis, permitting large-scale annotation of previously uncharacterized regulatory relationships relevant to the evolution of human cognition and disease. Our analyses identify hundreds of genes that physically interact with enhancers gained on the human lineage, many of which are under purifying selection and associated with human cognitive function. We integrate chromatin contacts with non-coding variants identified in schizophrenia genome-wide association studies (GWAS), highlighting multiple candidate schizophrenia risk genes and pathways, including transcription factors involved in neurogenesis, and cholinergic signalling molecules, several of which are supported by independent expression quantitative trait loci and gene expression analyses. Genome editing in human neural progenitors suggests that one of these distal schizophrenia GWAS loci regulates FOXG1 expression, supporting its potential role as a schizophrenia risk gene.

Here we report the X-ray structure of the catalytic core of h0GG1 bound to oxoG.C-containing DNA at 2.1 Angstrom resolution. The structure reveals the mechanistic basis for the recognition and catalytic excision of DNA damage by h0GG1 and by other members of the enzyme superfamily to which it belongs.

More recently, related studies on magnetic ferroelectrics(5-14) have signalled a revival of interest in this phenomenon. From a technological point of view, the mutual control of electric and magnetic properties is an attractive possibility(15), but the number of candidate materials is limited and the effects are typically too small to be useful in applications. Here we report the discovery of ferroelectricity in a perovskite manganite, TbMnO3, where the effect of spin frustration causes sinusoidal antiferromagnetic ordering. The modulated magnetic structure is accompanied by a magnetoelastically induced lattice modulation, and with the emergence of a spontaneous polarization. In the magnetic ferroelectric TbMnO3, we found gigantic magnetoelectric and magnetocapacitance effects, which can be attributed to switching of the electric polarization induced by magnetic fields. Frustrated spin systems therefore provide a new area to search for magnetoelectric media."], ["Stable single-unit-cell nanosheets of zeolite MFI as active and long-lived catalysts", "Zeolites-microporous crystalline aluminosilicates-are widely used in petrochemistry and fine-chemical synthesis(1-3) because strong acid sites within their uniform micropores enable size- and shape-selective catalysis. But the very presence of the micropores, with aperture diameters below 1 nm, often goes hand-in-hand with diffusion limitations(3-5) that adversely affect catalytic activity. The problem can be overcome by reducing the thickness of the zeolite crystals, which reduces diffusion path lengths and thus improves molecular diffusion(4,5). This has been realized by synthesizing zeolite nanocrystals(6), by exfoliating layered zeolites(7-9), and by introducing mesopores in the microporous material through templating strategies(10-17) or demetallation processes(18-22). But except for the exfoliation, none of these strategies has produced 'ultrathin' zeolites with thicknesses below 5 nm. Here we show that appropriately designed bifunctional surfactants can direct the formation of zeolite structures on themesoporous and microporous length scales simultaneously and thus yield MFI (ZSM-5, one of the most important catalysts in the petrochemical industry) zeolite nanosheets that are only 2 nm thick, which corresponds to the b-axis dimension of a single MFI unit cell. The large number of acid sites on the external surface of these zeolites renders them highly active for the catalytic conversion of large organic molecules, and the reduced crystal thickness facilitates diffusion and thereby dramatically suppresses catalyst deactivation through coke deposition during methanol-to-gasoline conversion. We expect that our synthesis approach could be applied to other zeolites to improve their performance in a range of important catalytic applications."], ["Synthesis and Characterization of Titanium-Substituted Large Pore SSZ-42 Zeolite", "Titanium-substituted large pore SSZ-42 zeolite was synthesized for the first time using the corresponding borosilicate as starting material.

Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified more than 600 variants associated with human traits(1), but these typically explain small fractions of phenotypic variation, raising questions about the use of further studies. Here, using 183,727 individuals, we show that hundreds of genetic variants, in at least 180 loci, influence adult height, a highly heritable and classic polygenic trait(2,3). The large number of loci reveals patterns with important implications for genetic studies of common human diseases and traits. First, the 180 loci are not random, but instead are enriched for genes that are connected in biological pathways (P = 0.016) and that underlie skeletal growth defects (P<0.001). Second, the likely causal gene is often located near the most strongly associated variant: in 13 of 21 loci containing a known skeletal growth gene, that gene was closest to the associated variant. Third, at least 19 loci have multiple independently associated variants, suggesting that allelic heterogeneity is a frequent feature of polygenic traits, that comprehensive explorations of already-discovered loci should discover additional variants and that an appreciable fraction of associated loci may have been identified. Fourth, associated variants are enriched for likely functional effects on genes, being over-represented among variants that alter amino-acid structure of proteins and expression levels of nearby genes. Our data explain approximately 10% of the phenotypic variation in height, and we estimate that unidentified common variants of similar effect sizes would increase this figure to approximately 16% of phenotypic variation (approximately 20% of heritable variation). Although additional approaches are needed to dissect the genetic architecture of polygenic human traits fully, our findings indicate that GWA studies can identify large numbers of loci that implicate biologically relevant genes and pathways."], ["Ammoniated phyllosilicates with a likely outer Solar System origin on (1) Ceres", "Studies of the dwarf planet (1) Ceres using ground-based and orbiting telescopes have concluded that its closest meteoritic analogues are the volatile-rich CI and CM carbonaceous chondrites(1,2). Water in clay minerals(3), ammoniated phyllosilicates(4), or a mixture of Mg(OH)(2) (brucite), Mg2CO3 and iron-rich serpentine(5,6) have all been proposed to exist on the surface. In particular, brucite has been suggested from analysis of the mid-infrared spectrum of Ceres(6). But the lack of spectral data across telluric absorption bands in the wavelength region 2.5 to 2.9 micrometres-where the OH stretching vibration and the H2O bending overtone are found-has precluded definitive identifications. In addition, water vapour around Ceres has recently been reported(7), possibly originating from localized sources. Here we report spectra of Ceres from 0.4 to 5 micrometres acquired at distances from similar to 82,000 to 4,300 kilometres from the surface. Our measurements indicate widespread ammoniated phyllosilicates across the surface, but no detectable water ice. Ammonia, accreted either as organic matter or as ice, may have reacted with phyllosilicates on Ceres during differentiation. This suggests that material from the outer Solar System was incorporated into Ceres, either during its formation at great heliocentric distance or by incorporation of material transported into the main asteroid belt."], ["Organic bipolar transistors", "Devices made using thin-film semiconductors have attracted much interest recently owing to new application possibilities. Among materials systems suitable for thin-film electronics, organic semiconductors are of particular interest; their low cost, biocompatible carbon-based materials and deposition by simple techniques such as evaporation or printing enable organic semiconductor devices to be used for ubiquitous electronics, such as those used on or in the human body or on clothing and packages(1-3). The potential of organic electronics can be leveraged only if the performance of organic transistors is improved markedly. Here we present organic bipolar transistors with outstanding device performance: a previously undescribed vertical architecture and highly crystalline organic rubrene thin films yield devices with high differential amplification (more than 100) and superior high-frequency performance over conventional devices. These bipolar transistors also give insight into the minority carrier diffusion length-a key parameter in organic semiconductors. Our results open the door to new device concepts of high-performance organic electronics with ever faster switching speeds."], ["Structural phase transition in monolayer MoTe<sub>2</sub> driven by electrostatic doping", "Monolayers of transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit numerous crystal phases with distinct structures, symmetries and physical properties(1-3). Exploring the physics of transitions between these different structural phases in two dimensions(4) may provide a means of switching material properties, with implications for potential applications. Structural phase transitions in TMDs have so far been induced by thermal or chemical means(5,6); purely electrostatic control over crystal phases through electrostatic doping was recently proposed as a theoretical possibility, but has not yet been realized(7,8). Here we report the experimental demonstration of an electrostatic-doping-driven phase transition between the hexagonal and monoclinic phases of monolayer molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2). We find that the phase transition shows a hysteretic loop in Raman spectra, and can be reversed by increasing or decreasing the gate voltage. We also combine second-harmonic generation spectroscopy with polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy to show that the induced monoclinic phase preserves the crystal orientation of the original hexagonal phase. Moreover, this structural phase transition occurs simultaneously across the whole sample. This electrostatic-doping control of structural phase transition opens up new possibilities for developing phase-change devices based on atomically thin membranes."], ["Phase-plate cryo-EM structure of a class B GPCR-G-protein complex", "Class B G-protein-coupled receptors are major targets for the treatment of chronic diseases, such as osteoporosis, diabetes and obesity. Here we report the structure of a full-length class B receptor, the calcitonin receptor, in complex with peptide ligand and heterotrimeric G alpha(s)beta gamma protein determined by Volta phase-plate single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. The peptide agonist engages the receptor by binding to an extended hydrophobic pocket facilitated by the large outward movement of the extracellular ends of transmembrane helices 6 and 7. This conformation is accompanied by a 60 degrees kink in helix 6 and a large outward movement of the intracellular end of this helix, opening the bundle to accommodate interactions with the alpha 5-helix of G alpha(s). Also observed is an extended intracellular helix 8 that contributes to both receptor stability and functional G-protein coupling via an interaction with the G beta subunit. This structure provides a new framework for understanding G-protein-coupled receptor function."], ["Catalytic conversion of nitrogen to ammonia by an iron model complex", "The reduction of nitrogen (N-2) to ammonia (NH3) is a requisite transformation for life(1). Although it is widely appreciated that the iron-rich cofactors of nitrogenase enzymes facilitate this transformation(2-5), how they do so remains poorly understood. A central element of debate has been the exact site or sites of N-2 coordination and reduction(6,7). In synthetic inorganic chemistry, an early emphasis was placed on molybdenum(8) because it was thought to be an essential element of nitrogenases(3) and because it had been established that well-defined molybdenum model complexes could mediate the stoichiometric conversion of N-2 to NH3 (ref. 9). This chemical transformation can be performed in a catalytic fashion by two well-defined molecular systems that feature molybdenum centres(10,11). However, it is now thought that iron is the only transition metal essential to all nitrogenases(3), and recent biochemical and spectroscopic data have implicated iron instead of molybdenum as the site of N-2 binding in the FeMo-cofactor(12). Here we describe a tris(phosphine) borane-supported iron complex that catalyses the reduction of N-2 to NH3 under mild conditions, and in which more than 40 per cent of the proton and reducing equivalents are delivered to N-2. Our results indicate that a single iron site may be capable of stabilizing the various NxHy intermediates generated during catalytic NH3 formation. Geometric tunability at iron imparted by a flexible iron-boron interaction in our model system seems to be important for efficient catalysis(13-15). We propose that the interstitial carbon atom recently assigned in the nitrogenase cofactor may have a similar role(16,17), perhaps by enabling a single iron site to mediate the enzymatic catalysis through a flexible iron-carbon interaction(18)."], ["Attosecond spectroscopy of size-resolved water clusters", "Electron dynamics in water are of fundamental importance for a broad range of phenomena(1-3), but their real-time study faces numerous conceptual and methodological challenges(4-6). Here we introduce attosecond size-resolved cluster spectroscopy and build up a molecular-level understanding of the attosecond electron dynamics in water. We measure the effect that the addition of single water molecules has on the photoionization time delays(7-9) of water clusters. We find a continuous increase of the delay for clusters containing up to four to five molecules and little change towards larger clusters. We show that these delays are proportional to the spatial extension of the created electron hole, which first increases with cluster size and then partially localizes through the onset of structural disorder that is characteristic of large clusters and bulk liquid water. These results indicate a previously unknown sensitivity of photoionization delays to electron-hole delocalization and indicate a direct link between electronic structure and attosecond photoionization dynamics. Our results offer new perspectives for studying electron-hole delocalization and its attosecond dynamics."], ["Materials interface engineering for solution-processed photovoltaics", "Advances in solar photovoltaics are urgently needed to increase the performance and reduce the cost of harvesting solar power. Solution-processed photovoltaics are cost-effective to manufacture and offer the potential for physical flexibility. Rapid progress in their development has increased their solar-power conversion efficiencies. The nanometre (electron) and micrometre (photon) scale interfaces between the crystalline domains that make up solution-processed solar cells are crucial for efficient charge transport. These interfaces include large surface area junctions between photoelectron donors and acceptors, the intralayer grain boundaries within the absorber, and the interfaces between photoactive layers and the top and bottom contacts. Controlling the collection and minimizing the trapping of charge carriers at these boundaries is crucial to efficiency."], ["Sustainably sourced components to generate high-strength adhesives", "Nearly all adhesives1,2 are derived from petroleum, create permanent bonds3, frustrate materials separation for recycling4,5 and prevent degradation in landfills. When trying to shift from petroleum feedstocks to a sustainable materials ecosystem, available options suffer from low performance, high cost or lack of availability at the required scales. Here we present a sustainably sourced adhesive system, made from epoxidized soy oil, malic acid and tannic acid, with performance comparable to that of current industrial products. Joints can be cured under conditions ranging from use of a hair dryer for 5 min to an oven at 180 & DEG;C for 24 h. Adhesion between metal substrates up to around 18 MPa is achieved, and, in the best cases, performance exceeds that of a classic epoxy, the strongest modern adhesive. All components are biomass derived, low cost and already available in large quantities. Manufacturing at scale can be a simple matter of mixing and heating, suggesting that this new adhesive may contribute towards the sustainable bonding of materials. We present a sustainably sourced adhesive system, with performance comparable to that of current industrial products, made from epoxidized soy oil, malic acid and tannic acid, all biomass derived, low cost and readily available."], ["Ultralow-dielectric-constant amorphous boron nitride", "Decrease in processing speed due to increased resistance and capacitance delay is a major obstacle for the down-scaling of electronics(1-3). Minimizing the dimensions of interconnects (metal wires that connect different electronic components on a chip) is crucial for the miniaturization of devices. Interconnects are isolated from each other by non-conducting (dielectric) layers. So far, research has mostly focused on decreasing the resistance of scaled interconnects because integration of dielectrics using low-temperature deposition processes compatible with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductors is technically challenging. Interconnect isolation materials must have low relative dielectric constants (kappa values), serve as diffusion barriers against the migration of metal into semiconductors, and be thermally, chemically and mechanically stable. Specifically, the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems recommends(4) the development of dielectrics with kappa values of less than 2 by 2028. Existing low-kappa materials (such as silicon oxide derivatives, organic compounds and aerogels) have kappa values greater than 2 and poor thermo-mechanical properties(5). Here we report three-nanometre-thick amorphous boron nitride films with ultralow kappa values of 1.78 and 1.16 (close to that of air, kappa = 1) at operation frequencies of 100 kilohertz and 1 megahertz, respectively. The films are mechanically and electrically robust, with a breakdown strength of 7.3 megavolts per centimetre, which exceeds requirements. Cross-sectional imaging reveals that amorphous boron nitride prevents the diffusion of cobalt atoms into silicon under very harsh conditions, in contrast to reference barriers. Our results demonstrate that amorphous boron nitride has excellent low-kappa dielectric characteristics for high-performance electronics."], ["Global histone modification patterns predict risk of prostate cancer recurrence", "Aberrations in post-translational modifications of histones have been shown to occur in cancer cells but only at individual promoters(1); they have not been related to clinical outcome. Other than being targeted to promoters, modifications of histones, such as acetylation and methylation of lysine and arginine residues, also occur over large regions of chromatin including coding regions and non-promoter sequences, which are referred to as global histone modifications(2). Here we show that changes in global levels of individual histone modifications are also associated with cancer and that these changes are predictive of clinical outcome. Through immunohistochemical staining of primary prostatectomy tissue samples, we determined the percentage of cells that stained for the histone acetylation and dimethylation of five residues in histones H3 and H4. Grouping of samples with similar patterns of modifications identified two disease subtypes with distinct risks of tumour recurrence in patients with low-grade prostate cancer. These histone modification patterns were predictors of outcome independently of tumour stage, preoperative prostate-specific antigen levels, and capsule invasion. Thus, widespread changes in specific histone modifications indicate previously undescribed molecular heterogeneity in prostate cancer and might underlie the broad range of clinical behaviour in cancer patients."], ["Phase separation organizes the site of autophagosome formation", "The pre-autophagosomal structure in yeast is a liquid-like condensate of Atg proteins whose phase separation may have a critical, active role in autophagy. Many biomolecules undergo liquid-liquid phase separation to form liquid-like condensates that mediate diverse cellular functions(1,2). Autophagy is able to degrade such condensates using autophagosomes-double-membrane structures that are synthesized de novo at the pre-autophagosomal structure (PAS) in yeast(3-5). Whereas Atg proteins that associate with the PAS have been characterized, the physicochemical and functional properties of the PAS remain unclear owing to its small size and fragility. Here we show that the PAS is in fact a liquid-like condensate of Atg proteins. The autophagy-initiating Atg1 complex undergoes phase separation to form liquid droplets in vitro, and point mutations or phosphorylation that inhibit phase separation impair PAS formation in vivo. In vitro experiments show that Atg1-complex droplets can be tethered to membranes via specific protein-protein interactions, explaining the vacuolar membrane localization of the PAS in vivo. We propose that phase separation has a critical, active role in autophagy, whereby it organizes the autophagy machinery at the PAS."], ["IDENTIFICATION AND INHIBITION OF THE ICE/CED-3 PROTEASE NECESSARY FOR MAMMALIAN APOPTOSIS", "The protease responsible for the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and necessary for apoptosis has been purified and characterized. This enzyme, named apopain, is composed of two subunits of relative molecular mass (M(r)) 17K and 12K that are derived from a common proenzyme identified as CPP32. This proenzyme is related to interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme (ICE) and CED-3, the product of a gene required for programmed cell death in Caenorhabditis elegans. A potent peptide aldehyde inhibitor has been developed and shown to prevent apoptotic events In vitro, suggesting that apopain/CPP32 is important for the initiation of apoptotic cell death."], ["Dense packings of the Platonic and Archimedean solids", "Dense particle packings have served as useful models of the structures of liquid, glassy and crystalline states of matter(1-4), granular media(3,5), heterogeneous materials(3) and biological systems(6-8). Probing the symmetries and other mathematical properties of the densest packings is a problem of interest in discrete geometry and number theory(9-11). Previous work has focused mainly on spherical particles-very little is known about dense polyhedral packings. Here we formulate the generation of dense packings of polyhedra as an optimization problem, using an adaptive fundamental cell subject to periodic boundary conditions (we term this the 'adaptive shrinking cell' scheme). Using a variety of multi-particle initial configurations, we find the densest known packings of the four non-tiling Platonic solids (the tetrahedron, octahedron, dodecahedron and icosahedron) in three-dimensional Euclidean space. The densities are 0.782..., 0.947..., 0.904... and 0.836..., respectively. Unlike the densest tetrahedral packing, which must not be a Bravais lattice packing, the densest packings of the other non-tiling Platonic solids that we obtain are their previously known optimal (Bravais) lattice packings. Combining our simulation results with derived rigorous upper bounds and theoretical arguments leads us to the conjecture that the densest packings of the Platonic and Archimedean solids with central symmetry are given by their corresponding densest lattice packings. This is the analogue of Kepler's sphere conjecture for these solids."], ["Modular click chemistry libraries for functional screens using a diazotizing reagent", "Click chemistry is a concept in which modular synthesis is used to rapidly find new molecules with desirable properties1. Copper(I)-catalysed azide\u2013alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) triazole annulation and sulfur(VI) fluoride exchange (SuFEx) catalysis are widely regarded as click reactions2,3,4, providing rapid access to their products in yields approaching 100% while being largely orthogonal to other reactions. However, in the case of CuAAC reactions, the availability of azide reagents is limited owing to their potential toxicity and the risk of explosion involved in their preparation. Here we report another reaction to add to the click reaction family: the formation of azides from primary amines, one of the most abundant functional groups5. The reaction uses just one equivalent of a simple diazotizing species, fluorosulfuryl azide6,7,8,9,10,11 (FSO2N3), and enables the preparation of over 1,200 azides on 96-well plates in a safe and practical manner. This reliable transformation is a powerful tool for the CuAAC triazole annulation, the most widely used click reaction at present. This method greatly expands the number of accessible azides and 1,2,3-triazoles and, given the ubiquity of the CuAAC reaction, it should find application in organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry, chemical biology and materials science."], ["Global change drives modern plankton communities away from the pre-industrial state", "The ocean-the Earth's largest ecosystem-is increasingly affected by anthropogenic climate change(1,2). Large and globally consistent shifts have been detected in species phenology, range extension and community composition in marine ecosystems(3-5). However, despite evidence for ongoing change, it remains unknown whether marine ecosystems have entered an Anthropocene(6) state beyond the natural decadal to centennial variability. This is because most observational time series lack a long-term baseline, and the few time series that extend back into the pre-industrial era have limited spatial coverage(7,8). Here we use the unique potential of the sedimentary record of planktonic foraminifera-ubiquitous marine zooplankton-to provide a global pre-industrial baseline for the composition of modern species communities. We use a global compilation of 3,774 seafloor-derived planktonic foraminifera communities of pre-industrial age(9) and compare these with communities from sediment-trap time series that have sampled plankton flux since AD 1978 (33 sites, 87 observation years). We find that the Anthropocene assemblages differ from their pre-industrial counterparts in proportion to the historical change in temperature. We observe community changes towards warmer or cooler compositions that are consistent with historical changes in temperature in 85% of the cases. These observations not only confirm the existing evidence for changes in marine zooplankton communities in historical times, but also demonstrate that Anthropocene communities of a globally distributed zooplankton group systematically differ from their unperturbed pre-industrial state."], ["DFT calculations bring insight to internal alkyne-to-vinylidene transformations at rhodium PNP- and PONOP-pincer complexes", "Density Functional Theory (DFT) has been used to investigate the alkyne-to-vinylidene isomerisation reaction mediated by [Rh(PXNXP)]+ complexes (X = CH2: 2,6-bis(di-tert-butylphosphinomethyl)pyridine (PNP) and X = O: 2,6-bis(di-tert-butylphosphinito)pyridine (PONOP)) for terminal alkynes HC[triple bond, length as m-dash]CR, where R = tBu and Ar\u2032 (3,5-tBu2C6H3). Calculations suggest the reaction mechanism proceeds via the slippage of \u03c0-bound alkyne at the Rh centre into a Rh\u2013alkyne \u03c3C\u2013H complex followed by an indirect 1,2-H shift to give the Rh\u2013vinylidene species. NBO (Natural Bond Orbital) analysis of the transition states corresponding to the latter indirect 1,2-H shift step indicates that the migrating hydrogen atom exhibits protic character and hence, the basicity of the H-accepting centre (C\u03b2) is controlled by the substituents at that same atom and can tune the 1,2-H shift transition state. QTAIM (Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecule) and NBO analyses of the Rh\u2013vinylidene complexes indicate that these species exhibit a Rh \u2190 C dative bond as well as \u03c0-back bonding from the Rh centre into the empty pz orbital of the carbene centre (C\u03b1), showing the Rh\u2013vinylidene complexes are Fischer type carbenes. Analysis of the alkyne and vinylidene complex HOMOs show that the equilibrium between the isomers can be tuned by the P\u2013Rh\u2013P bite angle of the [Rh(pincer)]+ fragment. Dictated by the nature of the pincer backbone, wider bite angles shift the equilibrium toward the formation of the Rh\u2013vinylidene isomer (e.g., X = CH2 and R = Ar\u2032), while tighter bite angles shift the equilibrium more to the formation of the Rh\u2013alkyne isomer (e.g., X = O and R = Ar\u2032)."], ["Efficient epoxidation over dinuclear sites in titanium silicalite-1", "Titanium silicalite-1 (TS-1) is a zeolitic material with MFI framework structure, in which 1 to 2 per cent of the silicon atoms are substituted for titanium atoms. It is widely used in industry owing to its ability to catalytically epoxidize olefins with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), leaving only water as a byproduct(1,2); around one million tonnes of propylene oxide are produced each year using this process(3). The catalytic properties of TS-1 are generally attributed to the presence of isolated Ti(iv) sites within the zeolite framework1. However, despite almost 40 years of experimental and computational investigation(4-10), the structure of these active Ti(iv) sites is unconfirmed, owing to the challenges of fully characterizing TS-1. Here, using a combination of spectroscopy and microscopy, we characterize in detail a series of highly active and selective TS-1 propylene epoxidation catalysts with well dispersed titanium atoms. We find that, on contact with (H2O2)-O-17, all samples exhibit a characteristic solid-state O-17 nuclear magnetic resonance signature that is indicative of the formation of bridging peroxo species on dinuclear titanium sites. Further, density functional theory calculations indicate that cooperativity between two titanium atoms enables propylene epoxidation via a low-energy reaction pathway with a key oxygen-transfer transition state similar to that of olefin epoxidation by peracids. We therefore propose that dinuclear titanium sites, rather than isolated titanium atoms in the framework, explain the high efficiency of TS-1 in propylene epoxidation with H2O2. This revised view of the active-site structure may enable further optimization of TS-1 and the industrial epoxidation process."], ["Co-deposition of hole-selective contact and absorber for improving the processability of perovskite solar cells", "Simplifying the manufacturing processes of renewable energy technologies is crucial to lowering the barriers to commercialization. In this context, to improve the manufacturability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), we have developed a one-step solution-coating procedure in which the hole-selective contact and perovskite light absorber spontaneously form, resulting in efficient inverted PSCs. We observed that phosphonic or carboxylic acids, incorporated into perovskite precursor solutions, self-assemble on the indium tin oxide substrate during perovskite film processing. They form a robust self-assembled monolayer as an excellent hole-selective contact while the perovskite crystallizes. Our approach solves wettability issues and simplifies device fabrication, advancing the manufacturability of PSCs. Our PSC devices with positive\u2013intrinsic\u2013negative (p-i-n) geometry show a power conversion efficiency of 24.5% and retain >90% of their initial efficiency after 1,200\u2009h of operating at the maximum power point under continuous illumination.

Flow systems have several advantages over batch systems, particularly in terms of productivity, heat and mixing efficiency, safety, and reproducibility'. However, for over half a century, pharmaceutical manufacturing has used batch systems because the synthesis of complex molecules such as drugs has been difficult to achieve with continuous-flow systems'''. Here we describe the continuous-flow synthesis of drugs using only columns packed with heterogeneous catalysts. Commercially available starting materials were successively passed through four columns containing achiral and chiral heterogeneous catalysts to produce (R)-rolipram', an anti-inflammatory drug and one of the family of y-aminobutyric acid (GABA) derivatives'. In addition, simply by replacing a column packed with a chiral heterogeneous catalyst with another column packed with the opposing enantiomer, we obtained antipole (S)-rolipram. Similarly, we also synthesized (R)-phenibut, another drug belonging to the GABA family. These flow systems are simple and stable with no leaching of metal catalysts. Our results demonstrate that multistep (eight steps in this case) chemical transformations for drug synthesis can proceed smoothly under flow conditions using only heterogeneous catalysts, without the isolation of any intermediates and without the separation of any catalysts, co-products, by-products, and excess reagents. We anticipate that such syntheses will be useful in pharmaceutical manufacturing."], ["Metastable liquid-liquid transition in a molecular model of water", "Liquid water's isothermal compressibility(1) and isobaric heat capacity(2), and the magnitude of its thermal expansion coefficient(3), increase sharply on cooling below the equilibrium freezing point. Many experimental(4-8), theoretical(9-11) and computational(12,13) studies have sought to understand the molecular origin and implications of this anomalous behaviour. Of the different theoretical scenarios(9,14,15) put forward, one posits the existence of a first-order phase transition that involves two forms of liquid water and terminates at a critical point located at deeply supercooled conditions(9,12). Some experimental evidence is consistent with this hypothesis(4,16), but no definitive proof of a liquid-liquid transition in water has been obtained to date: rapid ice crystallization has so far prevented decisive measurements on deeply supercooled water, although this challenge has been overcome recently(16). Computer simulations are therefore crucial for exploring water's structure and behaviour in this regime, and have shown(13,17-21) that some water models exhibit liquid-liquid transitions and others do not. However, recent work(22,23) has argued that the liquid-liquid transition has been mistakenly interpreted, and is in fact a liquid-crystal transition in all atomistic models of water. Here we show, by studying the liquid-liquid transition in the ST2 model of water(24) with the use of six advanced sampling methods to compute the free-energy surface, that two metastable liquid phases and a stable crystal phase exist at the same deeply supercooled thermodynamic condition, and that the transition between the two liquids satisfies the thermodynamic criteria of a first-order transition(25). We follow the rearrangement of water's coordination shell and topological ring structure along a thermodynamically reversible path from the low-density liquid to cubic ice(26). We also show that the system fluctuates freely between the two liquid phases rather than crystallizing. These findings provide unambiguous evidence for a liquid-liquid transition in the ST2 model of water, and point to the separation of time scales between crystallization and relaxation as being crucial for enabling it."], ["The structure of malaria pigment \u03b2-haematin", "Despite the worldwide public health impact of malaria, neither the mechanism by which the Plasmodium parasite detoxifies and sequesters haem, nor the action of current antimalarial drugs is well understood. The haem groups released from the digestion of the haemoglobin of infected red blood cells are aggregated into an insoluble material called haemozoin or malaria pigment. Synthetic beta-haematin (Fe-III-protoporphyrin-IX)(2) is chemically(1,2). spectroscopically(2,3) and crystallographically(4) identical to haemozoin and is believed to consist of strands of Fe-III-porphyrin units, linked into a polymer by propionate oxygen-iron bonds. Here we report the crystal structure of beta-haematin determined using simulated annealing techniques to analyse powder diffraction data obtained with synchrotron radiation. The molecules are linked into dimers through reciprocal iron-carboxylate bonds to one of the propionic side chains of each porphyrin, and the dimers form chains linked by hydrogen bonds in the crystal. This result has implications for understanding the action of current antimalarial drugs and possibly for the design of new therapeutic agents."], ["Monolayer atomic crystal molecular superlattices", "Artificial superlattices, based on van der Waals heterostructures of two-dimensional atomic crystals such as graphene or molybdenum disulfide, offer technological opportunities beyond the reach of existing materials(1-3). Typical strategies for creating such artificial superlattices rely on arduous layer-by-layer exfoliation and restacking, with limited yield and reproducibility(4-8). The bottom-up approach of using chemical-vapour deposition produces high-quality heterostructures(9-11) but becomes increasingly difficult for high-order superlattices. The intercalation of selected two-dimensional atomic crystals with alkali metal ions offers an alternative way to superlattice structures(12-14), but these usually have poor stability and seriously altered electronic properties. Here we report an electrochemical molecular intercalation approach to a new class of stable superlattices in which monolayer atomic crystals alternate with molecular layers. Using black phosphorus as a model system, we show that intercalation with cetyl-trimethylammonium bromide produces monolayer phosphorene molecular superlattices in which the interlayer distance is more than double that in black phosphorus, effectively isolating the phosphorene monolayers. Electrical transport studies of transistors fabricated from the monolayer phosphorene molecular superlattice show an on/off current ratio exceeding 107, along with excellent mobility and superior stability. We further show that several different two-dimensional atomic crystals, such as molybdenum disulfide and tungsten diselenide, can be intercalated with quaternary ammonium molecules of varying sizes and symmetries to produce a broad class of superlattices with tailored molecular structures, interlayer distances, phase compositions, electronic and optical properties. These studies define a versatile material platform for fundamental studies and potential technological applications."], ["Common genetic variants influence human subcortical brain structures", "The highly complex structure of the human brain is strongly shaped by genetic influences(1). Subcortical brain regions form circuits with cortical areas to coordinate movement(2), learning, memory(3) and motivation(4), and altered circuits can lead to abnormal behaviour and disease(5). To investigate how common genetic variants affect the structure of these brain regions, here we conduct genome-wide association studies of the volumes of seven subcortical regions and the intracranial volume derived from magnetic resonance images of 30,717 individuals from 50 cohorts. We identify five novel genetic variants influencing the volumes of the putamen and caudate nucleus. We also find stronger evidence for three loci with previously established influences on hippocampal volume(5) and intracranial volume(6). These variants show specific volumetric effects on brain structures rather than global effects across structures. The strongest effects were found for the putamen, where a novel intergenic locus with replicable influence on volume (rs945270; P = 1.08 X 10(-33); 0.52% variance explained) showed evidence of altering the expression of the KTN1 gene in both brain and blood tissue. Variants influencing putamen volume clustered near developmental genes that regulate apoptosis, axon guidance and vesicle transport.

Here we integrate typical covalent and ionic bonds within one molecule to create an organic-inorganic hybrid molecule, which can be used for bottom-up syntheses of hybrid materials. A combination of the organic covalent thioctic acid (TA) and the inorganic ionic calcium carbonate oligomer (CCO) through an acid-base reaction provides a TA-CCO hybrid molecule with the representative molecular formula TA(2)Ca(CaCO3)(2). Its dual reactivity involving copolymerization of the organic TA segment and inorganic CCO segment generates the respective covalent and ionic networks. The two networks are interconnected through TA-CCO complexes to form a covalent-ionic bicontinuous structure within the resulting hybrid material, poly(TA-CCO), which unifies paradoxical mechanical properties. The reversible binding of Ca2+-CO32- bonds in the ionic network and S-S bonds in the covalent network ensures material reprocessability with plastic-like mouldability while preserving thermal stability. The coexistence of ceramic-like, rubber-like and plastic-like behaviours within poly(TA-CCO) goes beyond current classifications of materials to generate an `elastic ceramic plastic'.

Clinical and experimental data suggest that the latter mode of control-termed cancer-immune equilibrium(1)-can be maintained for prolonged periods of time, possibly up to several decades(2-4). Although cancers most frequently originate in epithelial layers, the nature and spatiotemporal dynamics of immune responses that maintain cancer-immune equilibrium in these tissue compartments remain unclear. Here, using a mouse model of transplantable cutaneous melanoma(5), we show that tissue-resident memory CD8(+) T cells (T-RM cells) promote a durable melanoma-immune equilibrium that is confined to the epidermal layer of the skin. A proportion of mice (similar to 40%) transplanted with melanoma cells remained free of macroscopic skin lesions long after epicutaneous inoculation, and generation of tumour-specific epidermal CD69(+) CD103(+) T-RM cells correlated with this spontaneous disease control. By contrast, mice deficient in T-RM formation were more susceptible to tumour development. Despite being tumour-free at the macroscopic level, mice frequently harboured melanoma cells in the epidermal layer of the skin long after inoculation, and intravital imaging revealed that these cells were dynamically surveyed by T-RM cells. Consistent with their role in melanoma surveillance, tumour-specific T-RM cells that were generated before melanoma inoculation conferred profound protection from tumour development independently of recirculating T cells. Finally, depletion of T-RM cells triggered tumour outgrowth in a proportion (similar to 20%) of mice with occult melanomas, demonstrating that T-RM cells can actively suppress cancer progression. Our results show that T-RM cells have a fundamental role in the surveillance of subclinical melanomas in the skin by maintaining cancer-immune equilibrium. As such, they provide strong impetus for exploring these cells as targets of future anticancer immunotherapies."], ["Anti-Fatigue and Highly Conductive Thermocells for Continuous Electricity Generation", "The integration of wearable technologies with the human body requires power supplies that are mechanically compatible and able to continuously generate electricity like biological systems. Distinct from existing batteries relying on periodic recharging, thermocells added with thermogalvanic ions are a promising candidate because they enable continuous electricity generation through redox reactions driven by ubiquitous waste heat. However, challenges remain in mechanical adaptability, fatigue resistance, and ion conduction, severely limiting thermocells\u2019 sustainability and lifespan in practical applications. Herein, bionic mechanical training is applied to develop anti-fatigue and highly conductive thermocells with hierarchical fibrils and aligned nanochannels. It achieves simultaneous enhancements in mechanical performance and output power density. Compared with existing quasi-solid thermocells with disordered nano-networks, there are \u22481790-fold and 5-fold increases in the mechanical toughness and ionic conductivity, respectively. The stretchability can accommodate the human body's deformation, and the power density is comparable to that of state-of-the-art quasi-solid thermocells. Moreover, this is the first demonstration of an anti-fatigue thermocell with a threshold of 2500 J m\u22122, which is comparable to that of natural muscles and enables it to take full advantage of the continuous energy conversion mode."], ["Mesoscopic fast ion conduction in nanometre-scale planar heterostructures", "Ion conduction is of prime importance for solid-state reactions in ionic systems, and for devices such as high-temperature batteries and fuel cells, chemical filters and sensors(1,2). Ionic conductivity in solid electrolytes can be improved by dissolving appropriate impurities into the structure or by introducing interfaces that cause the redistribution of ions in the space-charge regions(3-11). Heterojunctions in two-phase systems should be particularly efficient at improving ionic conduction(3,4), and a qualitatively different conductivity behaviour is expected when interface spacing is comparable to or smaller than the width of the space-charge regions in comparatively large crystals(12-15). Here we report the preparation, by molecular-beam epitaxy, of defined heterolayered films composed of CaF2 and BaF2 that exhibit ionic conductivity (parallel to the interfaces) increasing proportionally with interface density-for interfacial spacing greater than 50 nanometres. The results are in excellent agreement with semi-infinite space-charge calculations(3), assuming a redistribution of fluoride ions at the interfaces. If the spacing is reduced further, the boundary zones overlap and the predicted mesoscopic size effect(3,12) is observed. At this point, the single layers lose their individuality and an artificial ionically conducting material with anomalous transport properties is generated. Our results should lead to fundamental insight into ionic contact processes and to tailored ionic conductors of potential relevance for medium-temperature applications."], ["A subthermionic tunnel field-effect transistor with an atomically thin channel", "The fast growth of information technology has been sustained by continuous scaling down of the silicon-based metal-oxide field-effect transistor. However, such technology faces two major challenges to further scaling. First, the device electrostatics (the ability of the transistor's gate electrode to control its channel potential) are degraded when the channel length is decreased, using conventional bulk materials such as silicon as the channel. Recently, two-dimensional semiconducting materials(1-7) have emerged as promising candidates to replace silicon, as they can maintain excellent device electrostatics even at much reduced channel lengths. The second, more severe, challenge is that the supply voltage can no longer be scaled down by the same factor as the transistor dimensions because of the fundamental thermionic limitation of the steepness of turn-on characteristics, or subthreshold swing(8,9). To enable scaling to continue without a power penalty, a different transistor mechanism is required to obtain subthermionic subthreshold swing, such as band-to-band tunnelling(10-16). Here we demonstrate band-to-band tunnel field-effect transistors (tunnelFETs), based on a two-dimensional semiconductor, that exhibit steep turn-on; subthreshold swing is a minimum of 3.9 millivolts per decade and an average of 31.1 millivolts per decade for four decades of drain current at room temperature. By using highly doped germanium as the source and atomically thin molybdenum disulfide as the channel, a vertical heterostructure is built with excellent electrostatics, a strain-free heterointerface, a lowtunnelling barrier, and a large tunnelling area. Our atomically thin and layered semiconducting-channel tunnel-FET(ATLAS-TFET) is the only planar architecture tunnel-FET to achieve subthermionic subthreshold swing over four decades of drain current, as recommended in ref. 17, and is also the only tunnel-FET(inany architecture) to achieve this at a low power-supply voltage of 0.1 volts. Our device is at present the thinnest-channel subthermionic transistor, and has the potential to open up new avenues for ultra-dense and low-power integrated circuits, as well as for ultra-sensitive biosensors and gas sensors(18-21)."], ["Dynamic spatial progression of isolated lithium during battery operations", "The increasing demand for next-generation energy storage systems necessitates the development of high-performance lithium batteries(1-3). Unfortunately, current Li anodes exhibit rapid capacity decay and a short cycle life(4-6), owing to the continuous generation of solid electrolyte interface(7,8) and isolated Li (i-Li)(9-11). The formation of i-Li during the nonuniform dissolution of Li dendrites(12) leads to a substantial capacity loss in lithium batteries under most testing conditions(13). Because i-Li loses electrical connection with the current collector, it has been considered electrochemically inactive or 'dead' in batteries(14,15). Contradicting this commonly accepted presumption, here we show that i-Li is highly responsive to battery operations, owing to its dynamic polarization to the electric field in the electrolyte. Simultaneous Li deposition and dissolution occurs on two ends of the i-Li, leading to its spatial progression toward the cathode (anode) during charge (discharge). Revealed by our simulation results, the progression rate of i-Li is mainly affected by its length, orientation and the applied current density. Moreover, we successfully demonstrate the recovery of i-Li in Cu-Li cells with >100% Coulombic efficiency and realize LiNi0.5Mn0.3Co0.2O2 (NMC)-Li full cells with extended cycle life."], ["Formation of massive black holes through runaway collisions in dense young star clusters", "A luminous X-ray source is associated with MGG 11-a cluster of young stars similar to200 pc from the centre of the starburst galaxy M 82 (refs 1, 2). The properties of this source are best explained(3,4) by invoking a black hole with a mass of at least 350 solar masses (350M.), which is intermediate between stellar-mass and supermassive black holes. A nearby but somewhat more massive cluster ( MGG 9) shows no evidence of such an intermediate-mass black hole(1,3), raising the issue of just what physical characteristics of the clusters can account for this difference. Here we report numerical simulations of the evolution and motion of stars within the clusters, where stars are allowed to merge with each other. We find that for MGG 11 dynamical friction leads to the massive stars sinking rapidly to the centre of the cluster, where they participate in a runaway collision. This produces a star of 800-3,000 M., which ultimately collapses to a black hole of intermediate mass. No such runaway occurs in the cluster MGG 9, because the larger cluster radius leads to a mass segregation timescale a factor of five longer than for MGG 11."], ["A stable low-temperature H<sub>2</sub>-production catalyst by crowding Pt on \u03b1-MoC", "The water-gas shift (WGS) reaction is an industrially important source of pure hydrogen (H-2) at the expense of carbon monoxide and water(1,2.) This reaction is of interest for fuel-cell applications, but requires WGS catalysts that are durable and highly active at low temperatures(3). Here we demonstrate that the structure (Pt1Ptn)/alpha-MoC, where isolated platinum atoms (Pt-1) and subnanometre platinum clusters (Pt-n) are stabilized on alpha-molybdenum carbide (alpha-MoC), catalyses the WGS reaction even at 313 kelvin, with a hydrogen-production pathway involving direct carbon monoxide dissociation identified. We find that it is critical to crowd the alpha-MoC surface with Pt-1 and Pt-n species, which prevents oxidation of the support that would cause catalyst deactivation, as seen with gold/alpha-MoC (ref. (4)), and gives our system high stability and a high metal-normalized turnover number of 4,300,000 moles of hydrogen per mole of platinum. We anticipate that the strategy demonstrated here will be pivotal for the design of highly active and stable catalysts for effective activation of important molecules such as water and carbon monoxide for energy production."], ["Proteomics identifies new therapeutic targets of early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma", "Hepatocellular carcinoma is the third leading cause of deaths from cancer worldwide. Infection with the hepatitis B virus is one of the leading risk factors for developing hepatocellular carcinoma, particularly in East Asia(1). Although surgical treatment may be effective in the early stages, the five-year overall rate of survival after developing this cancer is only 50-70%(2). Here, using proteomic and phospho-proteomic profiling, we characterize 110 paired tumour and non-tumour tissues of clinical early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma related to hepatitis B virus infection. Our quantitative proteomic data highlight heterogeneity in early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma: we used this to stratify the cohort into the subtypes S-I, S-II and S-III, each of which has a different clinical outcome. S-III, which is characterized by disrupted cholesterol homeostasis, is associated with the lowest overall rate of survival and the greatest risk of a poor prognosis after first-line surgery. The knockdown of sterol O-acyltransferase 1 (SOAT1)-high expression of which is a signature specific to the S-III subtype-alters the distribution of cellular cholesterol, and effectively suppresses the proliferation and migration of hepatocellular carcinoma. Finally, on the basis of a patient-derived tumour xenograft mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma, we found that treatment with avasimibe, an inhibitor of SOAT1, markedly reduced the size of tumours that had high levels of SOAT1 expression. The proteomic stratification of early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma presented in this study provides insight into the tumour biology of this cancer, and suggests opportunities for personalized therapies that target it."], ["Quantum nonlinear optics with single photons enabled by strongly interacting atoms", "The realization of strong nonlinear interactions between individual light quanta (photons) is a long-standing goal in optical science and engineering(1,2), being of both fundamental and technological significance. In conventional optical materials, the nonlinearity at light powers corresponding to single photons is negligibly weak. Here we demonstrate a medium that is nonlinear at the level of individual quanta, exhibiting strong absorption of photon pairs while remaining transparent to single photons. The quantum nonlinearity is obtained by coherently coupling slowly propagating photons(3-5) to strongly interacting atomic Rydberg states(6-12) in a cold, dense atomic gas(13,14). Our approach paves the way for quantum-byquantum control of light fields, including single-photon switching(15), all-optical deterministic quantum logic(16) and the realization of strongly correlated many-body states of light(17)."], ["Non-epitaxial single-crystal 2D material growth by geometric confinement", "Two-dimensional (2D) materials and their heterostructures show a promising path for next-generation electronics(1-3). Nevertheless, 2D-based electronics have not been commercialized, owing mainly to three critical challenges: i) precise kinetic control of layer-by-layer 2D material growth, ii) maintaining a single domain during the growth, and iii) wafer-scale controllability of layer numbers and crystallinity. Here we introduce a deterministic, confined-growth technique that can tackle these three issues simultaneously, thus obtaining wafer-scale single-domain 2D monolayer arrays and their heterostructures on arbitrary substrates. We geometrically confine the growth of the first set of nuclei by defining a selective growth area via patterning SiO2 masks on two-inch substrates. Owing to substantial reduction of the growth duration at the micrometre-scale SiO2 trenches, we obtain wafer-scale single-domain monolayer WSe2 arrays on the arbitrary substrates by filling the trenches via short growth of the first set of nuclei, before the second set of nuclei is introduced, thus without requiring epitaxial seeding. Further growth of transition metal dichalcogenides with the same principle yields the formation of single-domain MoS2/WSe2 heterostructures. Our achievement will lay a strong foundation for 2D materials to fit into industrial settings."], ["A colorimetric sensor array for odour visualization", "Array-based vapour-sensing devices are used to detect and differentiate between chemically diverse analytes. These systems- based on cross-responsive sensor elements-aim to mimic the mammalian olfactory system(1-3) by producing composite responses unique to each odorant. Previous work has concentrated on a variety of non-specific chemical interactions(4-11) to detect non-coordinating organic vapours. But the most odiferous, toxic compounds often bind readily to metal ions. Here we report a simple optical chemical sensing method that utilizes the colour change induced in an array of metalloporphyrin dyes upon ligand binding while minimizing the need for extensive signal transduction hardware. The chemoselective response of a library of immobilized vapour-sensing metalloporphyrin dyes permits the visual identification of a wide range of ligating (alcohols, amines, ethers, phosphines, phosphites, thioethers and thiols) and even weakly ligating (arenes, halocarbons and ketones) vapours. Water geometrical correlation length), and consequently a purely diffusive large-scale behaviour for the force. Therefore, we conclude that our results are certainly applicable to disordered packings such as cohesionless soils or sand piles.

Akkermansia muciniphila has been robustly associated with positive systemic effects on host metabolism, favourable outcomes to checkpoint blockade in cancer immunotherapy and homeostatic immunity(4-7). Here we report the identification of a lipid from A. muciniphila's cell membrane that recapitulates the immunomodulatory activity of A. muciniphila in cell-based assays(8). The isolated immunogen, a diacyl phosphatidylethanolamine with two branched chains (a15:0-i15:0 PE), was characterized through both spectroscopic analysis and chemical synthesis. The immunogenic activity of a15:0-i15:0 PE has a highly restricted structure-activity relationship, and its immune signalling requires an unexpected toll-like receptor TLR2-TLRlheterodimer(9)(,1)(0). Certain features of the phospholipid's activity are worth noting: it is significantly less potent than known natural and synthetic TLR2 agonists; it preferentially induces some inflammatory cytokines but not others; and, at low doses (1% of EC50) it resets activation thresholds and responses for immune signalling. Identifying both the molecule and an equipotent synthetic analogue, its non-canonical TLR2-TLR1 signalling pathway, its immunomodulatory selectivity and its low-dose immunoregulatory effects provide a molecular mechanism for a model of A. muciniphila's ability to set immunological tone and its varied roles in health and disease."], ["Multi-colour organic light-emitting displays by solution processing", "Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) show promise for applications as high-quality self-emissive displays for portable devices such as cellular phones and personal organizers(1-4). Although monochrome operation is sufficient for some applications, the extension to multi-colour devices-such as RGB (red, green, blue) matrix displays-could greatly enhance their technological impact. Multi-colour OLEDs have been successfully fabricated by vacuum deposition of small electroluminescent molecules, but solution processing of larger molecules (electroluminescent polymers) would result in a cheaper and simpler manufacturing process. However, it has proved difficult to combine the solution processing approach with the high-resolution patterning techniques required to produce a pixelated display. Recent attempts have focused on the modification of standard printing techniques, such as screen printing(5-7) and ink jetting(8), but those still have technical drawbacks. Here we report a class of electroluminescent polymers that can be patterned in a way similar to standard photoresist materials-soluble polymers with oxetane sidegroups that can be crosslinked photochemically to produce insoluble polymer networks in desired areas. The resolution of the process is sufficient to fabricate pixelated matrix displays.

The challenge of developing effective separation and purification technologies that have much smaller energy footprints is greater for carbon dioxide (CO2) than for other gases; in addition to its involvement in climate change, CO2, is an impurity in natural gas, biogas (natural gas produced from biomass), syngas (CO/H-2, the main source of hydrogen in refineries) and many other gas streams. In the context of porous crystalline materials that can exploit both equilibrium and kinetic selectivity, size selectivity and targeted molecular recognition are attractive characteristics for CO2 separation and capture, as exemplified by zeolites 5A and 13X (ref. 2), as well as metal-organic materials (MOMs)(3-9). Here we report that a crystal engineering(7) or reticular chemistry(5,9) strategy that controls pore functionality and size in a series of MOMs with coordinately saturated metal centres and periodically arrayed hexafluorosilicate (SiF62-) anions enables a 'sweet spot' of kinetics and thermodynamics that offers high volumetric uptake at low CO2 partial pressure (less than 0.15 bar). Most importantly, such MOMs offer an unprecedented CO2 sorption selectivity over N-2, H-2 and CH4, even in the presence of moisture. These MOMs are therefore relevant to CO2 separation in the context of post-combustion (flue gas, CO2/N-2), pre-combustion (shifted synthesis gas stream, CO2/H-2) and natural gas upgrading (natural gas clean-up, CO2/CH4)."], ["Signatures of tunable superconductivity in a trilayer graphene moire superlattice", "Understanding the mechanism of high-transition-temperature (high-T-c) superconductivity is a central problem in condensed matter physics. It is often speculated that high-T-c superconductivity arises in a doped Mott insulator(1) as described by the Hubbard model(2-4). An exact solution of the Hubbard model, however, is extremely challenging owing to the strong electron-electron correlation in Mott insulators. Therefore, it is highly desirable to study a tunable Hubbard system, in which systematic investigations of the unconventional superconductivity and its evolution with the Hubbard parameters can deepen our understanding of the Hubbard model. Here we report signatures of tunable superconductivity in an ABC-trilayer graphene (TLG) and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) moire superlattice. Unlike in 'magic angle' twisted bilayer graphene, theoretical calculations show that under a vertical displacement field, the ABC-TLG/hBN heterostructure features an isolated flat valence miniband associated with a Hubbard model on a triangular superlattice(5,6) where the bandwidth can be tuned continuously with the vertical displacement field. Upon applying such a displacement field we find experimentally that the ABC-TLG/hBN superlattice displays Mott insulating states below 20 kelvin at one-quarter and one-half fillings of the states, corresponding to one and two holes per unit cell, respectively. Upon further cooling, signatures of superconductivity ('domes') emerge below 1 kelvin for the electron-and hole-doped sides of the one-quarter-filling Mott state. The electronic behaviour in the ABC-TLG/hBN superlattice is expected to depend sensitively on the interplay between the electron-electron interaction and the miniband bandwidth. By varying the vertical displacement field, we demonstrate transitions from the candidate superconductor to Mott insulator and metallic phases. Our study shows that ABC-TLG/hBN heterostructures offer attractive model systems in which to explore rich correlated behaviour emerging in the tunable triangular Hubbard model."], ["Perovskite superlattices with efficient carrier dynamics", "Compared with their three-dimensional (3D) counterparts, low-dimensional metal halide perovskites (2D and quasi-2D; B(2)A(n-1)M(n)X(3n+1), such as B = R-NH3+, A = HC(NH2)(2)(+), Cs+; M = Pb2+, Sn2+; X = Cl-, Br-, I-) with periodic inorganic-organic structures have shown promising stability and hysteresis-free electrical performance(1-)(6). However, their unique multiple-quantum-well structure limits the device efficiencies because of the grain boundaries and randomly oriented quantum wells in polycrystals(7). In single crystals, the carrier transport through the thickness direction is hindered by the layered insulating organic spacers(8). Furthermore, the strong quantum confinement from the organic spacers limits the generation and transport of free carriers(9,10). Also, lead-free metal halide perovskites have been developed but their device performance is limited by their low crystallinity and structural instability(11).

The inorganic slabs are aligned vertical to the substrate and interconnected in a criss-cross 2D network parallel to the substrate, leading to efficient carrier transport in three dimensions. A lattice-mismatched substrate compresses the organic spacers, which weakens the quantum confinement. The performance of a superlattice solar cell has been certified under the quasi-steady state, showing a stable 12.36% photoelectric conversion efficiency.

Between one-quarter and one-half of white dwarfs have elements heavier than helium in their atmospheres(1,2), even though these elements ought to sink rapidly into the stellar interiors (unless they are occasionally replenished) (3-5). The abundance ratios of heavy elements in the atmospheres of white dwarfs are similar to the ratios in rocky bodies in the Solar System(6,7). This fact, together with the existence of warm, dusty debris disks(8-13) surrounding about four per cent of white dwarfs(14-16), suggests that rocky debris from the planetary systems of white-dwarf progenitors occasionally pollutes the atmospheres of the stars(17). The total accreted mass of this debris is sometimes comparable to the mass of large asteroids in the Solar System(1). However, rocky, disintegrating bodies around a white dwarf have not yet been observed. Here we report observations of a white dwarf-WD 1145+017-being transited by at least one, and probably several, disintegrating planetesimals, with periods ranging from 4.5 hours to 4.9 hours. The strongest transit signals occur every 4.5 hours and exhibit varying depths (blocking up to 40 per cent of the star's brightness) and asymmetric profiles, indicative of a small object with a cometary tail of dusty effluent material. The star has a dusty debris disk, and the star's spectrum shows prominent lines from heavy elements such as magnesium, aluminium, silicon, calcium, iron, and nickel. This system provides further evidence that the pollution of white dwarfs by heavy elements might originate from disrupted rocky bodies such as asteroids and minor planets."], ["Role of Ions in Hydrogels with an Ionic Seebeck Coefficient of 52.9 mV K\u20131", "Ionic thermoelectric (i-TE) material with mobile ions as charge carriers has the potential to generate large thermal voltages at low operating temperatures.

The relationship between the intrinsic physical parameters of the ion and the thermoelectric performance is established, indicating the ability to influence the hydrogen bond by the ion is a crucial factor. Among these i-TE hydrogels, the PVA/CsI hydrogel exhibits the largest ionic Seebeck coefficient, reaching 52.9 mV K\u20131, which is the largest of all i-TE materials reported to date.

Previous studies have shown that biodiversity has positive effects on organisms and processes(4) across trophic levels(5). However, only a few studies have so far incorporated an explicit food-web perspective(6). In an eight-year biodiversity experiment, we studied an unprecedented range of above-and below-ground organisms and multitrophic interactions. A multitrophic data set originating from a single long-term experiment allows mechanistic insights that would not be gained from meta-analysis of different experiments. Here we show that plant diversity effects dampen with increasing trophic level and degree of omnivory. This was true both for abundance and species richness of organisms. Furthermore, we present comprehensive above-ground/below-ground biodiversity food webs. Both above ground and below ground, herbivores responded more strongly to changes in plant diversity than did carnivores or omnivores. Density and richness of carnivorous taxa was independent of vegetation structure. Below-ground responses to plant diversity were consistently weaker than above-ground responses. Responses to increasing plant diversity were generally positive, but were negative for biological invasion, pathogen infestation and hyperparasitism.

Previously proposed transformation mechanisms(1-3), based on traditional experimental observations that lacked atomistic resolution, cannot account for the complex nanostructures occurring at graphite-diamond interfaces during the transformation(4,5). Here we report the identification of coherent graphite-diamond interfaces, which consist of four basic structural motifs, in partially transformed graphite samples recovered from static compression, using high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy. These observations provide insight into possible pathways of the transformation. Theoretical calculations confirm that transformation through these coherent interfaces is energetically favoured compared with those through other paths previously proposed(1-3). The graphite-to-diamond transformation is governed by the formation of nanoscale coherent interfaces (diamond nucleation), which, under static compression, advance to consume the remaining graphite (diamond growth). These results may also shed light on transformation mechanisms of other carbon materials and boron nitride under different synthetic conditions."], ["Pluripotent state transitions coordinate morphogenesis in mouse and human embryos", "The foundations of mammalian development lie in a cluster of embryonic epiblast stem cells. In response to extracellular matrix signalling, these cells undergo epithelialization and create an apical surface in contact with a cavity(1,2), a fundamental event for all subsequent development. Concomitantly, epiblast cells transit through distinct pluripotent states(3,4), before lineage commitment at gastrulation. These pluripotent states have been characterized at the molecular level(5), but their biological importance remains unclear. Here we show that exit from an unrestricted naive pluripotent state is required for epiblast epithelialization and generation of the pro-amniotic cavity in mouse embryos. Embryonic stem cells locked in the naive state are able to initiate polarization but fail to undergo lumenogenesis. Mechanistically, exit from naive pluripotency activates an Oct4-governed transcriptional program that results in expression of glycosylated sialomucin proteins and the vesicle tethering and fusion events of lumenogenesis. Similarly, exit of epiblasts from naive pluripotency in cultured human post-implantation embryos triggers amniotic cavity formation and developmental progression. Our results add tissue-level architecture as a new criterion for the characterization of different pluripotent states, and show the relevance of transitions between these states during development of the mammalian embryo."], ["High-Strength Carbon Nanotube Film from Improving Alignment and Densification", "A new method is reported for preparing carbon nanotube (CNT) films.

The approach uses large-area graphene and MoS2 films grown by chemical vapour deposition for the fabrication of side-wall transistors on a 2-inch wafer.

They are probably analogues of carbonaceous chondrites(2,3) and are essential for understanding planetary formation processes. However, their physical properties remain poorly known because carbonaceous chondrite meteoroids tend not to survive entry to Earth's atmosphere. Here we report on global one-rotation thermographic images of the C-type asteroid 162173 Ryugu, taken by the thermal infrared imager (TIR)(4) onboard the spacecraft Hayabusa2(5), indicating that the asteroid's boulders and their surroundings have similar temperatures, with a derived thermal inertia of about 300 J m(-2) s(-0.5) K-1 (300 tiu). Contrary to predictions that the surface consists of regolith and dense boulders, this low thermal inertia suggests that the boulders are more porous than typical carbonaceous chondrites(6) and that their surroundings are covered with porous fragments more than 10 centimetres in diameter. Close-up thermal images confirm the presence of such porous fragments and the flat diurnal temperature profiles suggest a strong surface roughness effect(7,8). We also observed in the close-up thermal images boulders that are colder during the day, with thermal inertia exceeding 600 tiu, corresponding to dense boulders similar to typical carbonaceous chondrites(6). These results constrain the formation history of Ryugu: the asteroid must be a rubble pile formed from impact fragments of a parent body with microporosity(9) of approximately 30 to 50 per cent that experienced a low degree of consolidation. The dense boulders might have originated from the consolidated innermost region or they may have an exogenic origin.

When HMG-domain proteins such as HMG1, IXR (intrastrand-crosslink recognition) protein from yeast, or human upstream-binding factor (hUBF) bind cisplatin intrastrand crosslinks, they can be diverted from their natural binding sites on the genome and shield the adducts from excision repair(3-5). These activities sensitize cells to cisplatin and contribute to its cytotoxic properties, Crystallographic information about the structure of cisplatin-DNA adducts has been limited to short single-stranded deoxyoligonucleotides such as Cis-[Pt(NH3)(2){d(pGpG)}](6-8). Here we describe the X-ray structure at 2.6 Angstrom resolution of a double-stranded DNA dodecamer containing this adduct. Our information provides, to our knowledge, the first crystallographic look at a platinated DNA duplex and should help the design of new platinum and other metal crosslinking antitumour drug candidates. Moreover, the structure reveals a unique fusion of A- and B-type DNA segments that could be of more general importance."], ["Helical crack-front instability in mixed-mode fracture", "Planar crack propagation under pure tension loading (mode I) is generally stable. However, it becomes universally unstable with the superposition of a shear stress parallel to the crack front (mode III). Under this mixed-mode (I + III) loading configuration, an initially flat parent crack segments into an array of daughter cracks that rotate towards a direction of maximum tensile stress(1). This segmentation produces stepped fracture surfaces with characteristic 'lance-shaped' markings observed in a wide range of engineering(2-7) and geological materials(1,8). The origin of this instability remains poorly understood and a theory with which to predict the surface roughness scale is lacking. Here we perform large-scale simulations of mixed-mode I + III brittle fracture using a continuum phase-field method(9-11) that describes the complete three-dimensional crack-front evolution. The simulations reveal that planar crack propagation is linearly unstable against helical deformations of the crack front, which evolve nonlinearly into a segmented array of finger-shaped daughter cracks. Furthermore, during their evolution, facets gradually coarsen owing to the growth competition of daughter cracks in striking analogy with the coarsening of finger patterns observed in nonequilibrium growth phenomena(12-14). We show that the dynamically preferred unstable wavelength is governed by the balance of the destabilizing effect of far-field stresses and the stabilizing effect of cohesive forces on the process zone scale, and we derive a theoretical estimate for this scale using a new propagation law for curved cracks in three dimensions. The rotation angles of coarsened facets are also compared to theoretical predictions and available experimental data."], ["Template-imprinted nanostructured surfaces for protein recognition", "Synthetic materials capable of selectively recognizing proteins are important in separations(1), biosensors(2) and the development of biomedical materials(3-5). The technique of molecular imprinting creates specific recognition sites in polymers by using template molecules(6-9). Molecular recognition is attributed to binding sites that complement molecules in size, shape and chemical functionality(10). But attempts to imprint proteins have met with only limited success(11-15). Here we report a method for imprinting surfaces with protein-recognition sites. We use radio-frequency glow-discharge plasma deposition to form polymeric thin films(16) around proteins coated with disaccharide molecules. The disaccharides become covalently attached to the polymer film, creating polysaccharide-like cavities that exhibit highly selective recognition for a variety of template proteins, including albumin, immunoglobulin G, lysozyme, ribonuclease and streptavidin, Direct imaging of template recognition is achieved by patterning a surface at the micrometre scale with imprinted regions."], ["Pathway complexity in supramolecular polymerization", "Self-assembly provides an attractive route to functional organic materials, with properties and hence performance depending sensitively on the organization of the molecular building blocks(1-5). Molecular organization is a direct consequence of the pathways involved in the supramolecular assembly process, which is more amenable to detailed study when using one-dimensional systems. In the case of protein fibrils, formation and growth have been attributed to complex aggregation pathways(6-8) that go beyond traditional concepts of homogeneous(9-11) and secondary (12-14) nucleation events. The self-assembly of synthetic supramolecular polymers has also been studied and even modulated(15-18), but our quantitative understanding of the processes involved remains limited. Here we report time-resolved observations of the formation of supramolecular polymers from pi-conjugated oligomers. Our kinetic experiments show the presence of a kinetically favoured metastable assembly that forms quickly but then transforms into the thermodynamically favoured form. Quantitative insight into the kinetic experiments was obtained from kinetic model calculations, which revealed two parallel and competing pathways leading to assemblies with opposite helicity. These insights prompt us to use a chiral tartaric acid as an auxiliary to change the thermodynamic preference of the assembly process(19). We find that we can force aggregation completely down the kinetically favoured pathway so that, on removal of the auxiliary, we obtain only metastable assemblies."], ["From endoplasmic-reticulum stress to the inflammatory response", "The endoplasmic reticulum is responsible for much of a cell's protein synthesis and folding, but it also has an important role in sensing cellular stress. Recently, it has been shown that the endoplasmic reticulum mediates a specific set of intracellular signalling pathways in response to the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins, and these pathways are collectively known as the unfolded-protein response. New observations suggest that the unfolded-protein response can initiate inflammation, and the coupling of these responses in specialized cells and tissues is now thought to be fundamental in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. The knowledge gained from this emerging field will aid in the development of therapies for modulating cellular stress and inflammation."], ["Intrinsic ferroelectric switching from first principles", "The existence of domain walls, which separate regions of different polarization, can influence the dielectric(1), piezoelectric(2), pyroelectric(3) and electronic properties(4,5) of ferroelectric materials. In particular, domain-wall motion is crucial for polarization switching, which is characterized by the hysteresis loop that is a signature feature of ferroelectric materials(6). Experimentally, the observed dynamics of polarization switching and domain-wall motion are usually explained as the behaviour of an elastic interface pinned by a random potential that is generated by defects(7,8), which appear to be strongly sample-dependent and affected by various elastic, microstructural and other extrinsic effects(9-12). Theoretically, connecting the zero-kelvin, first-principles-based, microscopic quantities of a sample with finite-temperature, macroscopic properties such as the coercive field is critical for material design and device performance; and the lack of such a connection has prevented the use of techniques based on ab initio calculations for high-throughput computational materials discovery. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations(13) of 90 degrees domain walls (separating domains with orthogonal polarization directions) in the ferroelectric material PbTiO3 to provide microscopic insights that enable the construction of a simple, universal, nucleation-and-growth-based analytical model that quantifies the dynamics of many types of domain walls in various ferroelectrics. We then predict the temperature and frequency dependence of hysteresis loops and coercive fields at finite temperatures from first principles. We find that, even in the absence of defects, the intrinsic temperature and field dependence of the domain-wall velocity can be described with a nonlinear creep-like region and a depinning-like region. Our model enables quantitative estimation of coercive fields, which agree well with experimental results for ceramics and thin films. This agreement between model and experiment suggests that, despite the complexity of ferroelectric materials, typical ferroelectric switching is largely governed by a simple, universal mechanism of intrinsic domain-wall motion, providing an efficient framework for predicting and optimizing the properties of ferroelectric materials."], ["Reactive oxygen species prime <i>Drosophila</i> haematopoietic progenitors for differentiation", "Reactive oxygen species (ROS), produced during various electron transfer reactions in vivo, are generally considered to be deleterious to cells(1). In the mammalian haematopoietic system, haematopoietic stem cells contain low levels of ROS. However, unexpectedly, the common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) produce significantly increased levels of ROS2. The functional significance of this difference in ROS level in the two progenitor types remains unresolved(2,3). Here we show that Drosophila multipotent haematopoietic progenitors, which are largely akin to the mammalian myeloid progenitors(4), display increased levels of ROS under in vivo physiological conditions, which are downregulated on differentiation. Scavenging the ROS from these haematopoietic progenitors by using in vivo genetic tools retards their differentiation into mature blood cells. Conversely, increasing the haematopoietic progenitor ROS beyond their basal level triggers precocious differentiation into all three mature blood cell types found in Drosophila, through a signalling pathway that involves JNK and FoxO activation as well as Polycomb downregulation. We conclude that the developmentally regulated, moderately high ROS level in the progenitor population sensitizes them to differentiation, and establishes a signalling role for ROS in the regulation of haematopoietic cell fate. Our results lead to a model that could be extended to reveal a probable signalling role for ROS in the differentiation of CMPs in mammalian haematopoietic development and oxidative stress response."], ["Mechanism of electrochemical activation of carbon electrodes: role of graphite lattice defects", "By use of Raman spectroscopy as a probe, the relationship between carbon microstructure and increasesin the heterogeneous electron-transfer rate for carbon electrodes was examined. A distinctive Raman bandat 1360 cm-1 is proportional to the density of graphitic edge planes and may be used to monitor changesin edge plane density induced by carbon pretreatment procedures. It was shown that electrochemicaloxidation of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) caused fracturing of the graphite lattice, thusincreasing edge plane density. This result is consistent with other reports from laser activation of HOPG,which correlate increased edge plane density with increased electron-transfer rate. Creation of edge planeis a phenomenon common to both oxidative and nonoxidative activation procedures and is responsiblefor HOPG activation. Arguments about the involvement of graphitic oxide or oxygen containing functionalgroups in electron-transfer activation are presented. After the present results are combined with thosefrom the literature, it appears unlikely that oxygen functional groups are involved in electron-transferactivation of several benchmark redox systems on carbon electrodes."], ["Dynamic basis for dG.dT misincorporation via tautomerization and ionization", "Tautomeric and anionic Watson-Crick-like mismatches have important roles in replication and translation errors through mechanisms that are not fully understood. Here, using NMR relaxation dispersion, we resolve a sequence-dependent kinetic network connecting G center dot T/U wobbles with three distinct Watson-Crick mismatches: two rapidly exchanging tautomeric species (G(enol)center dot T/U reversible arrow G center dot T-enol/U-enol; population less than 0.4%) and one anionic species (G center dot T-/U-; population around 0.001% at neutral pH). The sequence-dependent tautomerization or ionization step was inserted into a minimal kinetic mechanism for correct incorporation during replication after the initial binding of the nucleotide, leading to accurate predictions of the probability of dG center dot dT misincorporation across different polymerases and pH conditions and for a chemically modified nucleotide, and providing mechanisms for sequence-dependent misincorporation. Our results indicate that the energetic penalty for tautomerization and/or ionization accounts for an approximately 10(-2) to 10(-3)-fold discrimination against misincorporation, which proceeds primarily via tautomeric dG(enol)center dot dT and dG center dot dT(enol), with contributions from anionic dG center dot dT(-) dominant at pH 8.4 and above or for some mutagenic nucleotides."], ["The calcium-permeable channel OSCA1.3 regulates plant stomatal immunity", "Perception of biotic and abiotic stresses often leads to stomatal closure in plants(1,2). Rapid influx of calcium ions (Ca2+) across the plasma membrane has an important role in this response, but the identity of the Ca(2+)channels involved has remained elusive(3,4). Here we report that theArabidopsis thalianaCa(2+)-permeable channel OSCA1.3 controls stomatal closure during immune signalling. OSCA1.3 is rapidly phosphorylated upon perception of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Biochemical and quantitative phosphoproteomics analyses reveal that the immune receptor-associated cytosolic kinase BIK1 interacts with and phosphorylates the N-terminal cytosolic loop of OSCA1.3 within minutes of treatment with the peptidic PAMP flg22, which is derived from bacterial flagellin. Genetic and electrophysiological data reveal that OSCA1.3 is permeable to Ca2+, and that BIK1-mediated phosphorylation on its N terminus increases this channel activity. Notably, OSCA1.3 and its phosphorylation by BIK1 are critical for stomatal closure during immune signalling, and OSCA1.3 does not regulate stomatal closure upon perception of abscisic acid-a plant hormone associated with abiotic stresses. This study thus identifies a plant Ca(2+)channel and its activation mechanisms underlying stomatal closure during immune signalling, and suggests specificity in Ca(2+)influx mechanisms in response to different stresses. A study inArabidopsis thalianashows that the immune receptor-associated cytosolic kinase BIK1 phosphorylates OSCA1.3 and identifies OSCA1.3 as the pathogen-responsive Ca2+-permeable channel that regulates stomatal closure."], ["Past, present, and future of lead\u2013acid batteries", "When Gaston Plant\u00e9 invented the lead\u2013acid battery more than 160 years ago, he could not have foreseen it spurring a multibillion-dollar industry.

A large gap in technological advancements should be seen as an opportunity for scientific engagement to expand the scope of lead\u2013acid batteries into power grid applications, which currently lack a single energy storage technology with optimal technical and economic performance."], ["Global exchange and accumulation of non-native plants", "All around the globe, humans have greatly altered the abiotic and biotic environment with ever-increasing speed. One defining feature of the Anthropocene epoch(1,2) is the erosion of biogeographical barriers by human-mediated dispersal of species into new regions, where they can naturalize and cause ecological, economic and social damage(3). So far, no comprehensive analysis of the global accumulation and exchange of alien plant species between continents has been performed, primarily because of a lack of data. Here we bridge this knowledge gap by using a unique global database on the occurrences of naturalized alien plant species in 481 mainland and 362 island regions. In total, 13,168 plant species, corresponding to 3.9% of the extant global vascular flora, or approximately the size of the native European flora, have become naturalized somewhere on the globe as a result of human activity. North America has accumulated the largest number of naturalized species, whereas the Pacific Islands show the fastest increase in species numbers with respect to their land area. Continents in the Northern Hemisphere have been the major donors of naturalized alien species to all other continents. Our results quantify for the first time the extent of plant naturalizations worldwide, and illustrate the urgent need for globally integrated efforts to control, manage and understand the spread of alien species."], ["Distribution control enables efficient reduced-dimensional perovskite LEDs", "The efficiency and operating lifetimes of perovskite light-emitting diodes is improved by using a fluorinated triphenylphosphine oxide additive to control the cation diffusion during film deposition and passivate the surface. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) based on perovskite quantum dots have shown external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of over 23% and narrowband emission, but suffer from limited operating stability(1). Reduced-dimensional perovskites (RDPs) consisting of quantum wells (QWs) separated by organic intercalating cations show high exciton binding energies and have the potential to increase the stability and the photoluminescence quantum yield(2,3). However, until now, RDP-based LEDs have exhibited lower EQEs and inferior colour purities(4-6). We posit that the presence of variably confined QWs may contribute to non-radiative recombination losses and broadened emission. Here we report bright RDPs with a more monodispersed QW thickness distribution, achieved through the use of a bifunctional molecular additive that simultaneously controls the RDP polydispersity while passivating the perovskite QW surfaces. We synthesize a fluorinated triphenylphosphine oxide additive that hydrogen bonds with the organic cations, controlling their diffusion during RDP film deposition and suppressing the formation of low-thickness QWs. The phosphine oxide moiety passivates the perovskite grain boundaries via coordination bonding with unsaturated sites, which suppresses defect formation. This results in compact, smooth and uniform RDP thin films with narrowband emission and high photoluminescence quantum yield. This enables LEDs with an EQE of 25.6% with an average of 22.1 +/- 1.2% over 40 devices, and an operating half-life of two hours at an initial luminance of 7,200 candela per metre squared, indicating tenfold-enhanced operating stability relative to the best-known perovskite LEDs with an EQE exceeding 20%(1,4-6)."], ["Skin electronics from scalable fabrication of an intrinsically stretchable transistor array", "Skin-like electronics that can adhere seamlessly to human skin or within the body are highly desirable for applications such as health monitoring(1,2), medical treatment(3,4), medical implants(5) and biological studies(6,7), and for technologies that include human-machine interfaces, soft robotics and augmented reality(8,9). Rendering such electronics soft and stretchable-like human skin-would make them more comfortable to wear, and, through increased contact area, would greatly enhance the fidelity of signals acquired from the skin. Structural engineering of rigid inorganic and organic devices has enabled circuit-level stretchability, but this requires sophisticated fabrication techniques and usually suffers from reduced densities of devices within an array(2,10-12). We reasoned that the desired parameters, such as higher mechanical deformability and robustness, improved skin compatibility and higher device density, could be provided by using intrinsically stretchable polymer materials instead. However, the production of intrinsically stretchable materials and devices is still largely in its infancy(13-15): such materials have been reported(11,16-19), but functional, intrinsically stretchable electronics have yet to be demonstrated owing to the lack of a scalable fabrication technology. Here we describe a fabrication process that enables high yield and uniformity from a variety of intrinsically stretchable electronic polymers. We demonstrate an intrinsically stretchable polymer transistor array with an unprecedented device density of 347 transistors per square centimetre. The transistors have an average charge-carrier mobility comparable to that of amorphous silicon, varying only slightly (within one order of magnitude) when subjected to 100 per cent strain for 1,000 cycles, without current-voltage hysteresis. Our transistor arrays thus constitute intrinsically stretchable skin electronics, and include an active matrix for sensory arrays, as well as analogue and digital circuit elements. Our process offers a general platform for incorporating other intrinsically stretchable polymer materials, enabling the fabrication of next-generation stretchable skin electronic devices."], ["Liquid metal for high-entropy alloy nanoparticles synthesis", "High-entropy alloy nanoparticles (HEA-NPs) show great potential as functional materials(1-3). However, thus far, the realized high-entropy alloys have been restricted to palettes of similar elements, which greatly hinders the material design, property optimization and mechanistic exploration for different applications(4,5). Herein, we discovered that liquid metal endowing negative mixing enthalpy with other elements could provide a stable thermodynamic condition and act as a desirable dynamic mixing reservoir, thus realizing the synthesis of HEA-NPs with a diverse range of metal elements in mild reaction conditions. The involved elements have a wide range of atomic radii (1.24-1.97 angstrom) and melting points (303-3,683 K). We also realized the precisely fabricated structures of nanoparticles via mixing enthalpy tuning. Moreover, the real-time conversion process (that is, from liquid metal to crystalline HEA-NPs) is captured in situ, which confirmed a dynamic fission-fusion behaviour during the alloying process."], ["Inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase prevents diabetic retinopathy", "Diabetic retinopathy is an important cause of blindness in adults(1,2), and is characterized by progressive loss of vascular cells and slow dissolution of inter-vascular junctions, which result in vascular leakage and retinal oedema(3). Later stages of the disease are characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration, tissue destruction and neovascularization(4,5). Here we identify soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) as a key enzyme that initiates pericyte loss and breakdown of endothelial barrier function by generating the diol 19,20-dihydroxydocosapentaenoic acid, derived from docosahexaenoic acid. The expression of sEH and the accumulation of 19,20-dihydroxydocosapentaenoic acid were increased in diabetic mouse retinas and in the retinas and vitreous humour of patients with diabetes. Mechanistically, the diol targeted the cell membrane to alter the localization of cholesterol-binding proteins, and prevented the association of presenilin 1 with N-cadherin and VE-cadherin, thereby compromising pericyte-endothelial cell interactions and inter-endothelial cell junctions. Treating diabetic mice with a specific sEH inhibitor prevented the pericyte loss and vascular permeability that are characteristic of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Conversely, overexpression of sEH in the retinal Muller glial cells of non-diabetic mice resulted in similar vessel abnormalities to those seen in diabetic mice with retinopathy. Thus, increased expression of sEH is a key determinant in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy, and inhibition of sEH can prevent progression of the disease."], ["Nanostructure surveys of macroscopic specimens by small-angle scattering tensor tomography", "The mechanical properties of many materials are based on the macroscopic arrangement and orientation of their nanostructure. This nanostructure can be ordered over a range of length scales. In biology, the principle of hierarchical ordering is often used to maximize functionality, such as strength and robustness of the material, while minimizing weight and energy cost. Methods for nanoscale imaging provide direct visual access to the ultrastructure (nanoscale structure that is too small to be imaged using light microscopy), but the field of view is limited and does not easily allow a full correlative study of changes in the ultrastructure over a macroscopic sample. Other methods of probing ultrastructure ordering, such as small-angle scattering of X-rays or neutrons, can be applied to macroscopic samples; however, these scattering methods remain constrained to two-dimensional specimens(1-4) or to isotropically oriented ultrastructures(5-7). These constraints limit the use of these methods for studying nanostructures with more complex orientation patterns, which are abundant in nature and materials science. Here, we introduce an imaging method that combines small-angle scattering with tensor tomography to probe nanoscale structures in three-dimensional macroscopic samples in a non-destructive way. We demonstrate the method by measuring the main orientation and the degree of orientation of nanoscale mineralized collagen fibrils in a human trabecula bone sample with a spatial resolution of 25 micrometres. Symmetries within the sample, such as the cylindrical symmetry commonly observed for mineralized collagen fibrils in bone(8-10), allow for tractable sampling requirements and numerical efficiency. Small-angle scattering tensor tomography is applicable to both biological and materials science specimens, and may be useful for understanding and characterizing smart or bio-inspired materials. Moreover, because the method is non-destructive, it is appropriate for in situ measurements and allows, for example, the role of ultrastructure in the mechanical response of a biological tissue or manufactured material to be studied."], ["Untying the insulating and superconducting orders in magic-angle graphene", "Tuning the electronic interactions by changing the dielectric environment of twisted bilayer graphene reveals the disappearance of the insulating states and their replacement by superconducting phases, suggesting a competition between the two phases. The coexistence of superconducting and correlated insulating states in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene(1-11)prompts fascinating questions about their relationship. Independent control of the microscopic mechanisms that govern these phases could help uncover their individual roles and shed light on their intricate interplay. Here we report on direct tuning of electronic interactions in this system by changing the separation distance between the graphene and a metallic screening layer(12,13). We observe quenching of correlated insulators in devices with screening layer separations that are smaller than the typical Wannier orbital size of 15 nanometres and with twist angles that deviate slightly from the magic angle of 1.10 +/- 0.05 degrees. Upon extinction of the insulating orders, the vacated phase space is taken over by superconducting domes that feature critical temperatures comparable to those in devices with strong insulators. In addition, we find that insulators at half-filling can reappear in small out-of-plane magnetic fields of 0.4 tesla, giving rise to quantized Hall states with a Chern number of 2. Our study suggests re-examination of the often-assumed 'parent-and-child' relation between the insulating and superconducting phases in moire graphene, and suggests a way of directly probing the microscopic mechanisms of superconductivity in strongly correlated systems."], ["Observation of unidirectional backscattering-immune topological electromagnetic states", "One of the most striking phenomena in condensed-matter physics is the quantum Hall effect, which arises in two-dimensional electron systems(1-4) subject to a large magnetic field applied perpendicular to the plane in which the electrons reside. In such circumstances, current is carried by electrons along the edges of the system, in so-called chiral edge states (CESs). These are states that, as a consequence of nontrivial topological properties of the bulk electronic band structure, have a unique directionality and are robust against scattering from disorder. Recently, it was theoretically predicted(5-7) that electromagnetic analogues of such electronic edge states could be observed in photonic crystals, which are materials having refractive-index variations with a periodicity comparable to the wavelength of the light passing through them. Here we report the experimental realization and observation of such electromagnetic CESs in a magneto-optical photonic crystal(7) fabricated in the microwave regime. We demonstrate that, like their electronic counterparts(8-13), electromagnetic CESs can travel in only one direction and are very robust against scattering from disorder; we find that even large metallic scatterers placed in the path of the propagating edge modes do not induce reflections. These modes may enable the production of new classes of electromagnetic device and experiments that would be impossible using conventional reciprocal photonic states alone. Furthermore, our experimental demonstration and study of photonic CESs provides strong support for the generalization and application of topological band theories to classical and bosonic systems, and may lead to the realization and observation of topological phenomena in a generally much more controlled and customizable fashion than is typically possible with electronic systems."], ["Spin entropy as the likely source of enhanced thermopower in Na<i><sub>x</sub></i>Co<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>", "In an electric field, the flow of electrons in a solid produces an entropy current in addition to the familiar charge current. This is the Peltier effect, and it underlies all thermoelectric refrigerators. The increased interest in thermoelectric cooling applications has led to a search for more efficient Peltier materials and to renewed theoretical investigation into how electron-electron interaction may enhance the thermopower of materials such as the transition-metal oxides(1-4). An important factor in this enhancement is the electronic spin entropy, which is predicted(4-6) to dominate the entropy current. However, the crucial evidence for the spin-entropy term, namely its complete suppression in a longitudinal magnetic field, has not been reported until now. Here we report evidence for such suppression in the layered oxide NaxCo2O4, from thermopower and magnetization measurements in both longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields. The strong dependence of thermopower on magnetic field provides a rare, unambiguous example of how strong electron-electron interaction effects can qualitatively alter electronic behaviour in a solid. We discuss the implications of our finding-that spin-entropy dominates the enhancement of thermopower in transition-metal oxides-for the search for better Peltier materials."], ["Self-shaping of oil droplets via the formation of intermediate rotator phases upon cooling", "Revealing the chemical and physical mechanisms underlying symmetry breaking and shape transformations is key to understanding morphogenesis(1). If we are to synthesize artificial structures with similar control and complexity to biological systems, we need energy-and material-efficient bottom-up processes to create building blocks of various shapes that can further assemble into hierarchical structures. Lithographic top-down processing(2) allows a high level of structural control in microparticle production but at the expense of limited productivity. Conversely, bottom-up particle syntheses(3-8) have higher material and energy efficiency, but are more limited in the shapes achievable. Linear hydrocarbons are known to pass through a series of metastable plastic rotator phases before freezing(9,10). Here we show that by using appropriate cooling protocols, we can harness these phase transitions to control the deformation of liquid hydrocarbon droplets and then freeze them into solid particles, permanently preserving their shape. Upon cooling, the droplets spontaneously break their shape symmetry several times, morphing through a series of complex regular shapes owing to the internal phase-transition processes. In this way we produce particles including micrometre-sized octahedra, various polygonal platelets, O-shapes, and fibres of submicrometre diameter, which can be selectively frozen into the corresponding solid particles. This mechanism offers insights into achieving complex morphogenesis from a system with a minimal number of molecular components."], ["Squalene accumulation in cholesterol auxotrophic lymphomas prevents oxidative cell death", "Cholesterol is essential for cells to grow and proliferate. Normal mammalian cells meet their need for cholesterol through its uptake or de novo synthesis(1), but the extent to which cancer cells rely on each of these pathways remains poorly understood. Here, using a competitive proliferation assay on a pooled collection of DNA-barcoded cell lines, we identify a subset of cancer cells that is auxotrophic for cholesterol and thus highly dependent on its uptake. Through metabolic gene expression analysis, we pinpoint the loss of squalene monooxygenase expression as a cause of cholesterol auxotrophy, particularly in ALK(+) anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) cell lines and primary tumours. Squalene monooxygenase catalyses the oxidation of squalene to 2,3-oxidosqualene in the cholesterol synthesis pathway and its loss results in accumulation of the upstream metabolite squalene, which is normally undetectable. In ALK(+) ALCLs, squalene alters the cellular lipid profile and protects cancer cells from ferroptotic cell death, providing a growth advantage under conditions of oxidative stress and in tumour xenografts. Finally, a CRISPR-based genetic screen identified cholesterol uptake by the low-density lipoprotein receptor as essential for the growth of ALCL cells in culture and as patient-derived xenografts. This work reveals that the cholesterol auxotrophy of ALCLs is a targetable liability and, more broadly, that systematic approaches can be used to identify nutrient dependencies unique to individual cancer types."], ["ICOS is an inducible T-cell co-stimulator structurally and functionally related to CD28", "The T-cell-specific cell-surface receptors CD28 and CTLA-4 are important regulators of the immune system. CD28 potently enhances those T-cell functions that are essential for an effective antigen-specific immune response(1-5), and the homologous CTLA-4 counterbalances the CD28-mediated signals and thus prevents an otherwise fatal overstimulation of the lymphoid system(6-9). Here we report the identification of a third member of this family of molecules, inducible co-stimulator (ICOS), which is a homodimeric protein of relative molecular mass 55,000-60,000 (M-r 55K-60K). Matching CD28 in potency, ICOS enhances all basic T-cell responses to a foreign antigen, namely proliferation, secretion of lymphokines, upregulation of molecules that mediate cell-cell interaction, and effective help for antibody secretion by B cells. Unlike the constitutively expressed CD28, ICOS has to be de novo induced on the T-cell surface, does not upregulate the production of interleukin-2, but superinduces the synthesis of interleukin-10, a B-cell-differentiation factor. In vivo, ICOS is highly expressed on tonsillar T cells, which are closely associated with B cells in the apical light zone of germinal centres, the site of terminal B-cell maturation.

Such molecular motors convert light or chemical energy into directional rotary or linear motion(2-10), and are usually prepared and operated in solution. But if they are to be used as nanomachines that can do useful work, it seems essential to construct systems that can function on a surface, like a recently reported linear artificial muscle(11). Surface-mounted rotors have been realized and limited directionality in their motion predicted(12,13). Here we demonstrate that a light-driven molecular motor capable of repetitive unidirectional rotation(14) can be mounted on the surface of gold nanoparticles. The motor design(14) uses a chiral helical alkene with an upper half that serves as a propeller and is connected through a carbon - carbon double bond ( the rotation axis) to a lower half that serves as a stator. The stator carries two thiol-functionalized 'legs', which then bind the entire motor molecule to a gold surface.

Existing biocontainment methods are insufficient because they impose evolutionary pressure on the organism to eject the safeguard by spontaneous mutagenesis or horizontal gene transfer, or because they can be circumvented by environmentally available compounds. Here we computationally redesign essential enzymes in the first organism possessing an altered genetic code (Escherichia coli strain C321.Delta A) to confer metabolic dependence on non-standard amino acids for survival. The resulting GMOs cannot metabolically bypass their biocontainment mechanisms using known environmental compounds, and they exhibit unprecedented resistance to evolutionary escape through mutagenesis and horizontal gene transfer. This work provides a foundation for safer GMOs that are isolated from natural ecosystems by a reliance on synthetic metabolites."], ["A novel multiple-stage antimalarial agent that inhibits protein synthesis", "There is an urgent need for new drugs to treat malaria, with broad therapeutic potential and novel modes of action, to widen the scope of treatment and to overcome emerging drug resistance. Here we describe the discovery of DDD107498, a compound with a potent and novel spectrum of antimalarial activity against multiple life-cycle stages of the Plasmodium parasite, with good pharmacokinetic properties and an acceptable safety profile. DDD107498 demonstrates potential to address a variety of clinical needs, including single-dose treatment, transmission blocking and chemoprotection. DDD107498 was developed from a screening programme against blood-stage malaria parasites; its molecular target has been identified as translation elongation factor 2 (eEF2), which is responsible for the GTP-dependent translocation of the ribosome along messenger RNA, and is essential for protein synthesis. This discovery of eEF2 as a viable antimalarial drug target opens up new possibilities for drug discovery."], ["One Stone Two Birds\u2014Enantioselective Bimetallic Catalysis for \u03b1-Amino Acid Derivatives with an Allene Unit", "A highly enantioselective 2,3-allenylation of acyclic and cyclic \u03b1-imino carboxylates via a synergistic bimetallic Pd/Cu catalysis with the same commercially available (R,Rp)-iPr-FOXAP (also as Phosferrox, (R,R)-[2-(4\u2019-i-propyloxazolin-2\u2019-yl)ferrocenyl]diphenyl phosphine) ligand for both metals affording optically active 2,3-butadienyl \u03b1-amino acid derivatives in high to excellent yields with excellent enantioselectivities has been developed.

Liquid behaviour on a surface can range from complete spreading, as in the 'tears of wine' effect(3,4), tominimal wetting as observed on a superhydrophobic lotus leaf(5). Controlling droplet movement is important in microfluidic liquid handling(6), on self-cleaning surfaces(7) and in heat transfer(8). Droplet motion can be achieved by gradients of surface energy(9-13). However, existing techniques require either a large gradient or a carefully prepared surface(9) to overcome the effects of contact line pinning, which usually limit dropletmotion(14). Here we show that two-component droplets of well-chosen miscible liquids such as propylene glycol and water depositedon clean glass are not subject to pinning and cause the motion of neighbouring droplets over a distance. Unlike the canonical predictions for these liquids on a high-energy surface, these droplets do not spread completely but exhibit an apparent contact angle. We demonstrate experimentally and analytically that these droplets are stabilized by evaporation-induced surface tension gradients and that they move in response to the vapour emitted by neighbouring droplets. Our fundamental understanding of this robust system enabled us to construct a wide variety of autonomous fluidic machines out of everyday materials."], ["Landscape of transcription in human cells", "Eukaryotic cells make many types of primary and processed RNAs that are found either in specific subcellular compartments or throughout the cells. A complete catalogue of these RNAs is not yet available and their characteristic subcellular localizations are also poorly understood. Because RNA represents the direct output of the genetic information encoded by genomes and a significant proportion of a cell's regulatory capabilities are focused on its synthesis, processing, transport, modification and translation, the generation of such a catalogue is crucial for understanding genome function. Here we report evidence that three-quarters of the human genome is capable of being transcribed, as well as observations about the range and levels of expression, localization, processing fates, regulatory regions and modifications of almost all currently annotated and thousands of previously unannotated RNAs. These observations, taken together, prompt a redefinition of the concept of a gene."], ["Ferroelectrochemistry: Advancing biodegradable molecular ferroelectric towards biomedical applications", "Implantable piezoelectric biomedical devices are revolutionizing medical technology with applications that enhance health care through innovative treatments and diagnostics. These devices utilize piezoelectric materials, which generate electric charge in response to mechanical stress, making them ideal for integration into the human body where natural movements can power them. Recent advancements include the development of biocompatible piezoelectric materials like the organic small molecule ferroelectric material, HFPD, which offers high piezoelectric coefficients and biodegradability, making it suitable for temporary medical implants that dissolve harmlessly after their purpose is served. These materials are being used to create flexible, self-assembling wafers and ultrasound stimulators like ImPULS for deep brain activation, showing promise in treating neurological disorders by providing targeted neural stimulation without the need for invasive surgery.

A great deal of control can now be exercised over the chemical composition, size and polydispersity(1,2) of colloidal particles, and many methods have been developed for assembling them into useful aggregates and materials, Here we describe a method for assembling colloidal gold nanoparticles rationally and reversibly into macroscopic aggregates. The method involves attaching to the surfaces of two batches of 13-nm gold particles non-complementary DNA oligonucleotides capped with thiol groups, which bind to gold, When we add to the solution an oligonucleotide duplex with 'sticky ends' that are complementary to the two grafted sequences, the nanoparticles self-assemble into aggregates, This assembly process can be reversed by thermal denaturation. This strategy should now make it possible to tailor the optical, electronic and structural properties of the colloidal aggregates by using the specificity of DNA interactions to direct the interactions between particles of different size and composition."], ["Widespread transmission of independent cancer lineages within multiple bivalve species", "Most cancers arise from oncogenic changes in the genomes of somatic cells, and while the cells may migrate by metastasis, they remain within that single individual. Natural transmission of cancer cells from one individual to another has been observed in two distinct cases in mammals (Tasmanian devils(1) and dogs(2,3)), but these are generally considered to be rare exceptions in nature. The discovery of transmissible cancer in soft-shell clams (Mya arenaria)(4) suggested that this phenomenon might be more widespread. Here we analyse disseminated neoplasia in mussels (Mytilus trossulus), cockles (Cerastoderma edule), and golden carpet shell clams (Polititapes aureus) and find that neoplasias in all three species are attributable to independent transmissible cancer lineages. In mussels and cockles, the cancer lineages are derived from their respective host species; however, unexpectedly, cancer cells in P. aureus are all derived from Venerupis corrugata, a different species living in the same geographical area. No cases of disseminated neoplasia have thus far been found in V. corrugata from the same region. These findings show that transmission of cancer cells in the marine environment is common in multiple species, that it has originated many times, and that while most transmissible cancers are found spreading within the species of origin, cross-species transmission of cancer cells can occur."], ["Creating, moving and merging Dirac points with a Fermi gas in a tunable honeycomb lattice", "Dirac points are central to many phenomena in condensed-matter physics, from massless electrons in graphene to the emergence of conducting edge states in topological insulators(1,2). At a Dirac point, two energy bands intersect linearly and the electrons behave as relativistic Dirac fermions. In solids, the rigid structure of the material determines the mass and velocity of the electrons, as well as their interactions. A different, highly flexible means of studying condensed-matter phenomena is to create model systems using ultracold atoms trapped in the periodic potential of interfering laser beams(3,4). Here we report the creation of Dirac points with adjustable properties in a tunable honeycomb optical lattice. Using momentum-resolved interband transitions, we observe a minimum bandgap inside the Brillouin zone at the positions of the two Dirac points. We exploit the unique tunability of our lattice potential to adjust the effective mass of the Dirac fermions by breaking inversion symmetry. Moreover, changing the lattice anisotropy allows us to change the positions of the Dirac points inside the Brillouin zone. When the anisotropy exceeds a critical limit, the two Dirac points merge and annihilate each other-a situation that has recently attracted considerable theoretical interest(5-9) but that is extremely challenging to observe in solids(10). We map out this topological transition in lattice parameter space and find excellent agreement with ab initio calculations. Our results not only pave the way to model materials in which the topology of the band structure is crucial, but also provide an avenue to exploring many-body phases resulting from the interplay of complex lattice geometries with interactions(11-13)."], ["Strain-retardant coherent perovskite phase stabilized Ni-rich cathode", "The introduction of a coherent perovskite phase into the layered structure of a lithium-ion battery reduces lattice strain and stress to produce a robust crystal structure. The use of state-of-the-art Ni-rich layered oxides (LiNixCoyMn1-x-yO2, x > 0.5) as the cathode material for lithium-ion batteries can push the energy and power density to a higher level than is currently available(1,2). However, volume variation associated with anisotropic lattice strain and stress that is being developed during lithium (de)intercalation induces severe structural instability and electrochemical decay of the cathode materials, which is amplified further when the battery is operating at a high voltage (above 4.5 V), which is essential for unlocking its high energy(3-6). Even after much effort by the research community, an intrinsic strain-retardant method for directly alleviating the continuous accumulation of lattice strain remains elusive. Here, by introducing a coherent perovskite phase into the layered structure functioning as a 'rivet', we significantly mitigate the pernicious structural evolutions by a pinning effect. The lattice strain evolution in every single cycle is markedly reduced by nearly 70% when compared with conventional materials, which significantly enhances morphological integrity leading to a notable improvement in battery cyclability. This strain-retardant approach broadens the perspective for lattice engineering to release the strain raised from lithium (de)intercalation and paves the way for the development of high-energy-density cathodes with long durability."], ["Spontaneous formation of ordered structures in thin films of metals supported on an elastomeric polymer", "Spontaneous generation of complex order in apparently simple systems is both arresting and potentially useful(1-11). Here we describe the appearance of complex, ordered structures induced by the buckling of thin metal films owing to thermal contraction of an underlying substrate. We deposit the films from the vapour phase on a thermally expanded polymer (polydimethylsiloxane, PDMS). Subsequent cooling of the polymer creates compressive stress in the metal Rim that is relieved by buckling with a uniform wavelength of 20-50 micrometres. The waves can be controlled and orientated by relief structures in the surface of the polymer, which can set up intricate, ordered patterns over large areas. We can account qualitatively for the size and form of the patterned features in terms of the non-uniform stresses developed in the film near steps on the polymer substrate. This patterning process may find applications in optical devices such as diffraction gratings and optical sensors, and as the basis for methods of strain analysis in materials."], ["Hindered dialkyl ether synthesis with electrogenerated carbocations", "Hindered ethers are of high value for various applications; however, they remain an underexplored area of chemical space because they are difficult to synthesize via conventional reactions(1,2). Such motifs are highly coveted in medicinal chemistry, because extensive substitution about the ether bond prevents unwanted metabolic processes that can lead to rapid degradation in vivo. Here we report a simple route towards the synthesis of hindered ethers, in which electrochemical oxidation is used to liberate high-energy carbocations from simple carboxylic acids. These reactive carbocation intermediates, which are generated with low electrochemical potentials, capture an alcohol donor under non-acidic conditions; this enables the formation of a range of ethers (more than 80 have been prepared here) that would otherwise be difficult to access. The carbocations can also be intercepted by simple nucleophiles, leading to the formation of hindered alcohols and even alkyl fluorides. This method was evaluated for its ability to circumvent the synthetic bottlenecks encountered in the preparation of 12 chemical scaffolds, leading to higher yields of the required products, in addition to substantial reductions in the number of steps and the amount of labour required to prepare them. The use of molecular probes and the results of kinetic studies support the proposed mechanism and the role of additives under the conditions examined. The reaction manifold that we report here demonstrates the power of electrochemistry to access highly reactive intermediates under mild conditions and, in turn, the substantial improvements in efficiency that can be achieved with these otherwise-inaccessible intermediates."], ["A pentanuclear iron catalyst designed for water oxidation", "Although the oxidation of water is efficiently catalysed by the oxygen-evolving complex in photosystem II (refs 1 and 2), it remains one of the main bottlenecks when aiming for synthetic chemical fuel production powered by sunlight or electricity. Consequently, the development of active and stable water oxidation catalysts is crucial, with heterogeneous systems(3,4) considered more suitable for practical use and their homogeneous counterparts more suitable for targeted, molecular-level design guided by mechanistic understanding(5-19). Research into the mechanism of water oxidation has resulted in a range of synthetic molecular catalysts, yet there remains much interest in systems that use abundant, inexpensive and environmentally benign metals such as iron (the most abundant transition metal in the Earth's crust and found in natural(20,21) and synthetic(22) oxidation catalysts). Water oxidation catalysts based on mononuclear iron complexes have been explored(9,12,16,18), but they often deactivate rapidly and exhibit relatively low activities. Here we report a pentanuclear iron complex that efficiently and robustly catalyses water oxidation with a turnover frequency of 1,900 per second, which is about three orders of magnitude larger than that of other iron-based catalysts. Electrochemical analysis confirms the redox flexibility of the system, characterized by six different oxidation states between Fe-5(II) and Fe-5(III); the Fe-5(III) state is active for oxidizing water. Quantum chemistry calculations indicate that the presence of adjacent active sites facilitates O-O bond formation with a reaction barrier of less than ten kilocalories per mole. Although the need for a high overpotential and the inability to operate in water-rich solutions limit the practicality of the present system, our findings clearly indicate that efficient water oxidation catalysts based on iron complexes can be created by ensuring that the system has redox flexibility and contains adjacent water-activation sites."], ["The role of low-volatility organic compounds in initial particle growth in the atmosphere", "About half of present-day cloud condensation nuclei originate from atmospheric nucleation, frequently appearing as a burst of new particles near midday(1). Atmospheric observations show that the growth rate of new particles often accelerates when the diameter of the particles is between one and ten nanometres(2,3). In this critical size range, new particles are most likely to be lost by coagulation with pre-existing particles(4), thereby failing to form new cloud condensation nuclei that are typically 50 to 100 nanometres across. Sulfuric acid vapour is often involved in nucleation but is too scarce to explain most subsequent growth(5,6), leaving organic vapours as the most plausible alternative, at least in the planetary boundary layer(7-10). Although recent studies(11-13) predict that low-volatility organic vapours contribute during initial growth, direct evidence has been lacking. The accelerating growth may result from increased photolytic production of condensable organic species in the afternoon(2), and the presence of a possible Kelvin (curvature) effect, which inhibits organic vapour condensation on the smallest particles (the nano-Kohler theory)(2,14), has so far remained ambiguous. Here we present experiments performed in a large chamber under atmospheric conditions that investigate the role of organic vapours in the initial growth of nucleated organic particles in the absence of inorganic acids and bases such as sulfuric acid or ammonia and amines, respectively. Using data from the same set of experiments, it has been shown(15) that organic vapours alone can drive nucleation. We focus on the growth of nucleated particles and find that the organic vapours that drive initial growth have extremely low volatilities (saturation concentration less than 10(-4.5) micrograms per cubic metre). As the particles increase in size and the Kelvin barrier falls, subsequent growth is primarily due to more abundant organic vapours of slightly higher volatility (saturation concentrations of 10(-4.5) to 10(-0.5) micrograms per cubic metre). We present a particle growth model that quantitatively reproduces our measurements. Furthermore, we implement a parameterization of the first steps of growth in a global aerosol model and find that concentrations of atmospheric cloud concentration nuclei can change substantially in response, that is, by up to 50 per cent in comparison with previously assumed growth rate parameterizations."], ["Amide-directed photoredox-catalysed C-C bond formation at unactivated <i>sp</i><SUP>3</SUP> C-H bonds", "Carbon-carbon (C-C) bond formation is paramount in the synthesis of biologically relevant molecules, modern synthetic materials and commodity chemicals such as fuels and lubricants.

Strategies that allow C-C bond formation at inert carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds enable access to molecules that would otherwise be inaccessible and the development of more efficient syntheses of complex molecules(1,2). Here we report a method for the formation of C-C bonds by directed cleavage of traditionally non-reactive C-H bonds and their subsequent coupling with readily available alkenes. Our methodology allows for amide-directed selective C-C bond formation at unactivated sp(3) C-H bonds in molecules that contain many such bonds that are seemingly indistinguishable. Selectivity arises through a relayed photoredox-catalysed oxidation of a nitrogen-hydrogen bond. We anticipate that our findings will serve as a starting point for functionalization at inert C-H bonds through a strategy involving hydrogen-atom transfer."], ["Receptor-mediated exopolysaccharide perception controls bacterial infection", "Surface polysaccharides are important for bacterial interactions with multicellular organisms, and some are virulence factors in pathogens. In the legume-rhizobium symbiosis, bacterial exopolysaccharides (EPS) are essential for the development of infected root nodules. We have identified a gene in Lotus japonicus, Epr3, encoding a receptor-like kinase that controls this infection. We show that epr3 mutants are defective in perception of purified EPS, and that EPR3 binds EPS directly and distinguishes compatible and incompatible EPS in bacterial competition studies. Expression of Epr3 in epidermal cells within the susceptible root zone shows that the protein is involved in bacterial entry, while rhizobial and plant mutant studies suggest that Epr3 regulates bacterial passage through the plant's epidermal cell layer. Finally, we show that Epr3 expression is inducible and dependent on host perception of bacterial nodulation ( Nod) factors. Plant-bacterial compatibility and bacterial access to legume roots is thus regulated by a two-stage mechanism involving sequential receptor-mediated recognition of Nod factor and EPS signals."], ["A platform for the discovery of new macrolide antibiotics", "The chemical modification of structurally complex fermentation products, a process known as semisynthesis, has been an important tool in the discovery and manufacture of antibiotics for the treatment of various infectious diseases. However, many of the therapeutics obtained in this way are no longer effective, because bacterial resistance to these compounds has developed. Here we present a practical, fully synthetic route to macrolide antibiotics by the convergent assembly of simple chemical building blocks, enabling the synthesis of diverse structures not accessible by traditional semisynthetic approaches. More than 300 new macrolide antibiotic candidates, as well as the clinical candidate solithromycin, have been synthesized using our convergent approach. Evaluation of these compounds against a panel of pathogenic bacteria revealed that the majority of these structures had antibiotic activity, some efficacious against strains resistant to macrolides in current use. The chemistry we describe here provides a platform for the discovery of new macrolide antibiotics and may also serve as the basis for their manufacture."], ["Synthesis and x-ray structure of dumb-bell-shaped C-120", "The discovery and large-scale synthesis of fullerenes have aroused interdisciplinary interest in these closed-cage molecules(1-6). C-60 can be photopolymerized into a form in which the cages are thought to be linked by cyclic C-4 units in a [2 + 2] cycloaddition(7), provoking theoretical studies of the C-60 dimer(8-15), the smallest subunit of such a polymer. The C-60 dimers C120O (refs 16, 17), C121H2 (ref. 17) and C120O2 (ref. 18) have been reported, in which the two C-60 molecules are linked by, respectively, a furan group, a cyclopentane ring and a cyclobutane ring plus two oxygen bridges; but the simplest dimer, C-120 linked by a cyclobutane ring alone, has not so far been observed, We now report that this dumb-bell-shaped molecule can be synthesized by a solid-state mechanochemical reaction of C-60 with potassium cyanide. Our X-ray structural analysis shows that the C-4 ring connecting the cages is square rather than rectangular-the latter is predicted theoretically(8,9,13-15). The dimer dissociates cleanly into two C-60 molecules on heating or one-electron reduction, but in the gas phase during mass-spectrometric measurements it undergoes successive loss of C-2 units, shrinking to even-numbered fullerenes such as C-118 and C-116 in a sequence similar to that seen for other large fullerenes(19,20)."], ["Enhanced fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Delta P681R mutation", "During the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a variety of mutations have accumulated in the viral genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and, at the time of writing, four variants of concern are considered to be potentially hazardous to human society(1). The recently emerged B.1.617.2/Delta variant of concern is closely associated with the COVID-19 surge that occurred in India in the spring of 2021 (ref.(2)). However, the virological properties of B.1.617.2/Delta remain unclear. Here we show that the B.1.617.2/Delta variant is highly fusogenic and notably more pathogenic than prototypic SARS-CoV-2 in infected hamsters. The P681R mutation in the spike protein, which is highly conserved in this lineage, facilitates cleavage of the spike protein and enhances viral fusogenicity. Moreover, we demonstrate that the P681R-bearing virus exhibits higher pathogenicity compared with its parental virus. Our data suggest that the P681R mutation is a hallmark of the virological phenotype of the B.1.617.2/Delta variant and is associated with enhanced pathogenicity."], ["A metabolite-derived protein modification integrates glycolysis with KEAP1-NRF2 signalling", "Mechanisms that integrate the metabolic state of a cell with regulatory pathways are necessary to maintain cellular homeostasis. Endogenous, intrinsically reactive metabolites can form functional, covalent modifications on proteins without the aid of enzymes(1,2), and regulate cellular functions such as metabolism(3-5) and transcription(6). An important 'sensor' protein that captures specific metabolic information and transforms it into an appropriate response is KEAP1, which contains reactive cysteine residues that collectively act as an electrophile sensor tuned to respond to reactive species resulting from endogenous and xenobiotic molecules. Covalent modification of KEAP1 results in reduced ubiquitination and the accumulation of NRF2(7,8), which then initiates the transcription of cytoprotective genes at antioxidant-response element loci. Here we identify a small-molecule inhibitor of the glycolytic enzyme PGK1, and reveal a direct link between glycolysis and NRF2 signalling. Inhibition of PGK1 results in accumulation of the reactive metabolite methylglyoxal, which selectively modifies KEAP1 to form a methylimidazole crosslink between proximal cysteine and arginine residues (MICA). This posttranslational modification results in the dimerization of KEAP1, the accumulation of NRF2 and activation of the NRF2 transcriptional program. These results demonstrate the existence of direct inter-pathway communication between glycolysis and the KEAP1-NRF2 transcriptional axis, provide insight into the metabolic regulation of the cellular stress response, and suggest a therapeutic strategy for controlling the cytoprotective antioxidant response in several human diseases."], ["EXTRACTION OF MID-OCEAN-RIDGE BASALT FROM THE UPWELLING MANTLE BY FOCUSED FLOW OF MELT IN DUNITE CHANNELS", "Like residual peridotites from mid-ocean ridges, peridotites from the mantle section of the Oman ophiolite are far from equilibrium with mid-ocean-ridge basalt (MORB).

Formation of dunite conduits by porous flow is sufficient to explain extraction of MORB from the mantle, and fracture mechanisms may not be necessary in this process."], ["A disinhibitory microcircuit for associative fear learning in the auditory cortex", "Learning causes a change in how information is processed by neuronal circuits. Whereas synaptic plasticity, an important cellular mechanism, has been studied in great detail, we know much less about how learning is implemented at the level of neuronal circuits and, in particular, how interactions between distinct types of neurons within local networks contribute to the process of learning. Here we show that acquisition of associative fear memories depends on the recruitment of a disinhibitory microcircuit in the mouse auditory cortex. Fear-conditioning-associated disinhibition in auditory cortex is driven by foot-shock-mediated cholinergic activation of layer 1 interneurons, in turn generating inhibition of layer 2/3 parvalbumin-positive interneurons. Importantly, pharmacological or optogenetic block of pyramidal neuron disinhibition abolishes fear learning. Together, these data demonstrate that stimulus convergence in the auditory cortex is necessary for associative fear learning to complex tones, define the circuit elements mediating this convergence and suggest that layer-1-mediated disinhibition is an important mechanism underlying learning and information processing in neocortical circuits."], ["Site-selective and versatile aromatic C\u2212H functionalization by thianthrenation", "Direct C\u2013H functionalization can quickly increase useful structural and functional molecular complexity1,2,3.

Here we report a highly selective aromatic C\u2013H functionalization reaction that does not require a particular directing group or substitution pattern to achieve selectivity, and provides functionalized arenes that can participate in various transformations. We introduce a persistent sulfur-based radical to functionalize complex arenes with high selectivity and obtain thianthrenium salts that are ready to engage in different transformations, via both transition-metal and photoredox catalysis.

Despite these benefits, its low volumetric energy density at ambient temperature and pressure presents substantial challenges, particularly for light-duty vehicles with little space available for on-board fuel storage(3). Adsorbed natural gas systems have the potential to store high densities of methane (CH4, the principal component of natural gas) within a porous material at ambient temperature and moderate pressures(4). Although activated carbons, zeolites, and metal-organic frameworks have been investigated extensively for CH4 storage(5-8), there are practical challenges involved in designing systems with high capacities and in managing the thermal fluctuations associated with adsorbing and desorbing gas from the adsorbent. Here, we use a reversible phase transition in a metal-organic framework to maximize the deliverable capacity of CH4 while also providing internal heat management during adsorption and desorption. In particular, the flexible compounds Fe(bdp) and Co(bdp) (bdp(2-) = 1,4-benzenedipyrazolate) are shown to undergo a structural phase transition in response to specific CH4 pressures, resulting in adsorption and desorption isotherms that feature a sharp 'step'. Such behaviour enables greater storage capacities than have been achieved for classical adsorbents(9), while also reducing the amount of heat released during adsorption and the impact of cooling during desorption.

Microscopic light manipulation, for this purpose, is achievable through photonic bandgap materials(1,2), a special class of photonic crystals in which three-dimensional, periodic dielectric constant variations controllably prohibit electromagnetic propagation throughout a specified frequency band. This can result in the localization of photons(3-6), thus providing a mechanism for controlling and inhibiting spontaneous light emission that can be exploited for photonic device fabrication. In fact, carefully engineered line defects could act as waveguides connecting photonic devices in all-optical microchips(7), and infiltration of the photonic material with suitable liquid crystals might produce photonic bandgap structures (and hence light-flow patterns) fully tunable by an externally applied voltage(8-10). However, the realization of this technology requires a strategy for the efficient synthesis of high-quality, large-scale photonic crystals with photonic bandgaps at micrometre and sub-micrometre wavelengths, and with rationally designed line and point defects for optical circuitry. Here we describe single crystals of silicon inverse opal with a complete three-dimensional photonic bandgap centred on 1.46 mu m, produced by growing silicon inside the voids of an opal template of close-packed silica spheres that are connected by small 'necks' formed during sintering, followed by removal of the silica template.

So far these polaritons have been limited to two classes: bulk polaritons, which propagate inside a material, and surface polaritons, which decay exponentially away from an interface. Here we report a near-field observation of ghost phonon polaritons, which propagate with in-plane hyperbolic dispersion on the surface of a polar uniaxial crystal and, at the same time, exhibit oblique wavefronts in the bulk. Ghost polaritons are an atypical non-uniform surface wave solution of Maxwell's equations, arising at the surface of uniaxial materials in which the optic axis is slanted with respect to the interface. They exhibit an unusual bi-state nature, being both propagating (phase-progressing) and evanescent (decaying) within the crystal bulk, in contrast to conventional surface waves that are purely evanescent away from the interface. Our real-space near-field imaging experiments reveal long-distance (over 20 micrometres), ray-like propagation of deeply subwavelength ghost polaritons across the surface, verifying long-range, directional and diffraction-less polariton propagation. At the same time, we show that control of the out-of-plane angle of the optic axis enables hyperbolic-to-elliptic topological transitions at fixed frequency, providing a route to tailor the band diagram topology of surface polariton waves. Our results demonstrate a polaritonic wave phenomenon with unique opportunities to tailor nanoscale light in natural anisotropic crystals.

Pauling showed that the presence of these two bond lengths leads to a macroscopic degeneracy of possible ground states(2,3), such that the system has finite entropy as the temperature tends towards zero. The dynamics associated with this degeneracy are experimentally inaccessible, however, as ice melts and the hydrogen dynamics cannot be studied independently of oxygen motion(4). An analogous system(5) in which this degeneracy can be studied is a magnet with the pyrochlore structure-termed 'spin ice'-where spin orientation plays a similar role to that of the hydrogen position in ice I-h. Here we present specific-heat data for one such system, Dy2Ti2O7, from which we infer a total spin entropy of 0.67Rln2. This is similar to the value, 0.71Rln2, determined for ice I-h, SO confirming the validity of the correspondence.

These structures are formed by using ordered mesoporous silicas as templates, the removal of which leaves a partially ordered graphitic framework. The resulting material supports a high dispersion of platinum nanoparticles, exceeding that of other common microporous carbon materials (such as carbon black, charcoal and activated carbon fibres). The platinum cluster diameter can be controlled to below 3 nanometres, and the high dispersion of these metal clusters gives rise to promising electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction, which could prove to be practically relevant for fuel-cell technologies. These nanomaterials can also be prepared in the form of free-standing films by using ordered silica films as the templates."], ["Adhesive force of a single gecko foot-hair", "Geckos are exceptional in their ability to climb rapidly up smooth vertical surfaces(1-3). Microscopy has shown that a gecko's foot has nearly five hundred thousand keratinous hairs or setae. Each 30-130 mu m long seta is only one-tenth the diameter of a human hair and contains hundreds of projections terminating in 0.2-0.5 mu m spatula-shaped structures(2,4). After nearly a century of anatomical description(2,4-6), here we report the first direct measurements of single setal force by using a two-dimensional micro-electromechanical systems force sensor(7) and a wire as a force gauge. Measurements revealed that a seta is ten times more effective at adhesion than predicted from maximal estimates on whole animals. Adhesive force values support the hypothesis that individual seta operate by van der Waals forces(8,9). The gecko's peculiar behaviour of toe uncurling and peeling(2) led us to discover two aspects of setal function which increase their effectiveness. A unique macroscopic orientation and preloading of the seta increased attachment force 600-fold above that of frictional measurements of the material. Suitably orientated setae reduced the forces necessary to peel the toe by simply detaching above a critical angle with the substratum."], ["Highly controlled acetylene accommodation in a metal-organic microporous material", "Metal - organic microporous materials(1-4) (MOMs) have attracted wide scientific attention owing to their unusual structure and properties, as well as commercial interest due to their potential applications in storage(5-9), separation(10,11) and heterogeneous catalysis(12,13). One of the advantages of MOMs compared to other microporous materials, such as activated carbons, is their ability to exhibit a variety of pore surface properties such as hydrophilicity and chirality, as a result of the controlled incorporation of organic functional groups into the pore walls(11,13-15). This capability means that the pore surfaces of MOMs could be designed to adsorb specific molecules; but few design strategies for the adsorption of small molecules have been established so far. Here we report high levels of selective sorption of acetylene molecules as compared to a very similar molecule, carbon dioxide, onto the functionalized surface of a MOM. The acetylene molecules are held at a periodic distance from one another by hydrogen bonding between two non-coordinated oxygen atoms in the nanoscale pore wall of the MOM and the two hydrogen atoms of the acetylene molecule. This permits the stable storage of acetylene at a density 200 times the safe compression limit of free acetylene at room temperature."], ["Rational design of reconfigurable prismatic architected materials", "Advances in fabrication technologies are enabling the production of architected materials with unprecedented properties. Most such materials are characterized by a fixed geometry, but in the design of some materials it is possible to incorporate internal mechanisms capable of reconfiguring their spatial architecture, and in this way to enable tunable functionality. Inspired by the structural diversity and foldability of the prismatic geometries that can be constructed using the snapology origami technique, here we introduce a robust design strategy based on space-filling tessellations of polyhedra to create three-dimensional reconfigurable materials comprising a periodic assembly of rigid plates and elastic hinges. Guided by numerical analysis and physical prototypes, we systematically explore the mobility of the designed structures and identify a wide range of qualitatively different deformations and internal rearrangements. Given that the underlying principles are scale-independent, our strategy can be applied to the design of the next generation of reconfigurable structures and materials, ranging from metre-scale transformable architectures to nanometre-scale tunable photonic systems."], ["The genomic landscape of Neanderthal ancestry in present-day humans", "Genomic studies have shown that Neanderthals interbred with modern humans, and that non-Africans today are the products of this mixture(1,2). The antiquity of Neanderthal gene flow into modern humans means that genomic regions that derive from Neanderthals in any one human today are usually less than a hundred kilobases in size. However, Neanderthal haplotypes are also distinctive enough that several studies have been able to detect Neanderthal ancestry at specific loci(1,3-8). We systematically infer Neanderthal haplotypes in the genomes of 1,004 present-day humans(9). Regions that harbour a high frequency of Neanderthal alleles are enriched for genes affecting keratin filaments, suggesting that Neanderthal alleles may have helped modern humans to adapt to non-African environments. We identify multiple Neanderthal-derived alleles that confer risk for disease, suggesting that Neanderthal alleles continue to shape human biology. An unexpected finding is that regions with reduced Neanderthal ancestry are enriched in genes, implying selection to remove genetic material derived from Neanderthals. Genes that are more highly expressed in testes than in any other tissue are especially reduced in Neanderthal ancestry, and there is an approximately fivefold reduction of Neanderthal ancestry on the X chromosome, which is known from studies of diverse species to be especially dense in male hybrid sterility genes(10-12). These results suggest that part of the explanation for genomic regions of reduced Neanderthal ancestry is Neanderthal alleles that caused decreased fertility in males when moved to a modern human genetic background."], ["Supramolecular Synthons in Crystal Engineering\u2014A New Organic Synthesis", "A crystal of an organic compound is the ultimate supermolecule, and its assembly, governed by chemical and geometrical factors, from individual molecules is the perfect example of solid-state molecular recognition. Implicit in the supramolecular description of a crystal structure is the fact that molecules in a crystal are held together by noncovalent interactions. The need for rational approaches towards solid-state structures of fundamental and practical importance has led to the emergence of crystal engineering, which seeks to understand intermolecular interactions and recognition phenomena in the context of crystal packing. The aim of crystal engineering is to establish reliable connections between molecular and supramolecular structure on the basis of intermolecular interactions. Ideally one would like to identify substructural units in a target supermolecule that can be assembled from logically chosen precursor molecules. Indeed, crystal engineering is a new organic synthesis, and the aim of this article is to show that rather than being only nominally relevant to organic chemistry, this subject is well within the mainstream, being surprisingly similar to traditional organic synthesis in concept. The details vary because one is dealing here with intermolecular interactions rather than with covalent bonds; so this article is divided into two parts. The first is concerned with strategy, highlighting the conceptual relationship between crystal engineering and organic synthesis and introduces the term supramolecular synthon. The second part emphasizes methodology, that is, the chemical and geometrical properties of specific intermolecular interactions."], ["A gradient-distributed liquid-metal hydrogel capable of tunable actuation", "Although thermoresponsive hydrogels have numerous applications that range from soft robots, biomedical engineering, and actuators to sensors for artificial muscles, the existing hydrogel actuators undergo only unidirectional deformation under a single thermal stimulus and suffer from slow actuation and unstable interfacial adhesion in multiple layers. Herein, hydrogels containing gradient-distributed polydopamine-coated eutectic gallium-indium (PDA-EGaIn) nanodroplets in a poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) matrix and thus featuring a gradient distribution of thermal conductivity and an increased barrier towards water loss are shown to be capable of a rapid and tuneable thermoresponse. Notably, whereas hydrogels with a low content of PDA-EGaIn undergo rapid one-way bending under a single thermal (45 \u00b0C) stimulus, those with a high content of PDA-EGaIn undergo sequential bidirectional (bending) actuation. The ability of these hydrogels to undergo fast and tuneable actuation under a single thermal stimulus makes them suitable for use in grab-release instruments and soft robots."], ["A long noncoding RNA maintains active chromatin to coordinate homeotic gene expression", "The genome is extensively transcribed into long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs), many of which are implicated in gene silencing(1,2). Potential roles of lincRNAs in gene activation are much less understood(3-5). Development and homeostasis require coordinate regulation of neighbouring genes through a process termed locus control(6). Some locus control elements and enhancers transcribe lincRNAs(7-10), hinting at possible roles in long-range control. In vertebrates, 39 Hox genes, encoding homeodomain transcription factors critical for positional identity, are clustered in four chromosomal loci; the Hox genes are expressed in nested anterior-posterior and proximal-distal patterns colinear with their genomic position from 3' to 5' of the cluster(11). Here we identify HOTTIP, a lincRNA transcribed from the 5' tip of the HOXA locus that coordinates the activation of several 5' HOXA genes in vivo. Chromosomal looping brings HOTTIP into close proximity to its target genes. HOTTIP RNA binds the adaptor protein WDR5 directly and targets WDR5/MLL complexes across HOXA, driving histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation and gene transcription. Induced proximity is necessary and sufficient for HOTTIP RNA activation of its target genes. Thus, by serving as key intermediates that transmit information from higher order chromosomal looping into chromatin modifications, lincRNAs may organize chromatin domains to coordinate long-range gene activation."], ["Production of iron nanoparticles by laser irradiation in a simulation of lunar-like space weathering", "'Space weathering' is the term applied to the darkening and reddening of planetary surface materials with time, along with the changes to the depths of absorption bands in their optical spectra. It has been invoked to explain the mismatched spectra of lunar rocks and regolith, and between those of asteroids and meteorites(1-6). The formation of nanophase iron particles on regolith grains as a result of micrometeorite impacts or irradiation by the solar wind has been proposed as the main cause of the change in the optical properties(7,8). But laboratory simulations(9-14) have not revealed the presence of these particles, although nanosecond-pulse laser irradiation did reproduce the optical changes(12) Here we report observations by transmission electron microscopy of olivine samples subjected to pulse laser irradiation. We fmd within the amorphous vapour-deposited rims of olivine grains nanophase iron particles similar to those observed in the rims of space-weathered lunar regolith grains(15,16). Reduction by hydrogen atoms implanted by the solar wind is therefore not necessary to form the particles. Moreover, the results support the idea that ordinary chondrites came from S-type asteroids(5), and thereby provides some constraints on the surface exposure ages of those asteroids."], ["Insights into the electrocatalysis of nitrobenzene using chemically-modified carbon nanotube electrodes", "The electrochemical behavior of nitrobenzene and its derivatives at chemically-functionalized multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) modified electrodes was studied. Experimental results showed that hydroxyl-containing MWNTs exhibited the highest electrocatalytic activity among the used MWNTs because of its weak capacitive features and oxygen-containing functional groups. The cycle voltammetrys of nitrobenzene derivatives on the MWNTs modified electrodes can be easily tuned by changing the substituted groups of nitrobenzene. Based on the experimental data, the electrochemical reaction mechanisms of nitrobenzene and its derivatives on the MWNTs modified electrodes have been discussed and analyzed."], ["Redox-switchable carboranes for uranium capture and release", "The uranyl ion (UO22+; U(vi) oxidation state) is the most common form of uranium found in terrestrial and aquatic environments and is a central component in nuclear fuel processing and waste remediation efforts. Uranyl capture from either seawater or nuclear waste has been well studied and typically relies on extremely strong chelating/binding affinities to UO22+ using chelating polymers(1,2), porous inorganic(3-5) or carbon-based(6,7) materials, as well as homogeneous(8) compounds. By contrast, the controlled release of uranyl after capture is less established and can be difficult, expensive or destructive to the initial material(2,9). Here we show how harnessing the redox-switchable chelating and donating properties of an ortho-substituted closo-carborane (1,2-(Ph2PO)(2)-1,2-C2B10H10) cluster molecule can lead to the controlled chemical or electrochemical capture and release of UO22+ in monophasic (organic) or biphasic (organic/aqueous) model solvent systems. This is achieved by taking advantage of the increase in the ligand bite angle when the closo-carborane is reduced to the nido-carborane, resulting in C-C bond rupture and cage opening. The use of electrochemical methods for uranyl capture and release may complement existing sorbent and processing systems. Redox-switchable chelation is demonstrated for a carborane cluster molecule, leading to controlled chemical or electrochemical capture and release of uranyl in monophasic or biphasic model solvent systems."], ["Limitations of a polymer-based hole transporting layer for application in planar inverted perovskite solar cells", "Planar inverted lead halide photovoltaics demonstrate remarkable photoconversion properties when employing poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) as a hole transporting layer. Herein, we elucidate the effect of ambient ultraviolet (UV) degradation on the structural and operational stability of the PTAA hole transporter through a series of rigorous optoelectrical characterization protocols. Due attention was given to the interplay between the polymer and perovskite absorber, both within the framework of a bilayer structure and fully assembled solar cells. The obtained results imply that UV degradation exerts a major influence on the structural integrity of PTAA, rather than on the interface with the perovskite light harvester. Moreover, UV exposure induced more adverse effects on tested samples than environmental humidity and oxygen, contributing more to the overall reduction of charge extraction properties of PTAA, as well as increased defect population upon prolonged UV exposure."], ["PHOTOCHROMISM INDUCED IN AN ELECTROLYTICALLY PRETREATED MOO3 THIN-FILM BY VISIBLE-LIGHT", "PHOTOCHROMIC materials, whose optical absorption properties change in response to light, are important for a number of technological applications. A stable, reusable photochromic thin-film could be used, for example, in optical displays and high-density memories. Thin films of some transition-metal oxides can be coloured blue by band-gap excitation using ultraviolet light 1-6. For use with common semiconductor laser sources, however, photochromic materials are required that respond to visible light. Here we report on the preparation of visible-light-sensitive, reversibly photochromic films of MoO3. Pretreated, vacuum-evaporated MoO3 thin films were slightly blued by cathodic polarization in a non-aqueous electrolyte; subsequent irradiation with visible light in air produced a strong colour enhancement. The photochromism could be erased by anodic polarization, and the coloration-decoloration process was repeatable over at least five cycles. The behaviour of these films contrasts with those blued by band-gap irradiation, which were not responsive to visible light."], ["ALLELE-SPECIFIC MOTIFS REVEALED BY SEQUENCING OF SELF-PEPTIDES ELUTED FROM MHC MOLECULES", "The crystal structures of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules contain a groove occupied by heterogeneous material thought to represent peptides central to immune recognition, although until now relatively little characterization of the peptides has been possible. Exact information about the contents of MHC grooves is now provided. Moreover, each MHC class I allele has its individual rules to which peptides presented in the grove adhere."], ["Synthesis of Sulfilimines Enabled by Copper-Catalyzed S-Arylation of Sulfenamides", "Herein, an unprecedented synthetic route to sulfilimines via a copper-catalyzed Chan\u2013Lam-type coupling of sulfenamides is presented. A key to success in this novel transformation is the chemoselective S-arylation of S(II) sulfenamides to form S(IV) sulfilimines, overriding the competitive, and more thermodynamically favored, C\u2013N bond formation that does not require a change in the sulfur oxidation state. Computations reveal that the selectivity arises from a selective transmetallation event where bidentate sulfenamide coordination through the sulfur and oxygen atoms favors the S-arylation pathway. The mild and environmentally benign catalytic conditions enable broad functional group compatibility, allowing a variety of diaryl or alkyl aryl sulfilimines to be efficiently prepared. The Chan\u2013Lam coupling procedure could also tolerate alkenylboronic acids as coupling partners to afford alkenyl aryl sulfilimines, a class of scaffolds that cannot be directly synthesized via conventional imination strategies. The benzoyl-protecting groups could be conveniently removed from the product, which, in turn, could be readily transformed into several S(IV) and S(VI) derivatives."], ["Enhancement of proteasome activity by a small-molecule inhibitor of USP14", "Proteasomes, the primary mediators of ubiquitin-protein conjugate degradation, are regulated through complex and poorly understood mechanisms. Here we show that USP14, a proteasome-associated deubiquitinating enzyme, can inhibit the degradation of ubiquitin-protein conjugates both in vitro and in cells. A catalytically inactive variant of USP14 has reduced inhibitory activity, indicating that inhibition is mediated by trimming of the ubiquitin chain on the substrate. A high-throughput screen identified a selective small-molecule inhibitor of the deubiquitinating activity of human USP14. Treatment of cultured cells with this compound enhanced degradation of several proteasome substrates that have been implicated in neurodegenerative disease. USP14 inhibition accelerated the degradation of oxidized proteins and enhanced resistance to oxidative stress. Enhancement of proteasome activity through inhibition of USP14 may offer a strategy to reduce the levels of aberrant proteins in cells under proteotoxic stress."], ["Graphene as a subnanometre trans-electrode membrane", "Isolated, atomically thin conducting membranes of graphite, called graphene, have recently been the subject of intense research with the hope that practical applications in fields ranging from electronics to energy science will emerge(1). The atomic thinness, stability and electrical sensitivity of graphene motivated us to investigate the potential use of graphene membranes and graphene nanopores to characterize single molecules of DNA in ionic solution. Here we show that when immersed in an ionic solution, a layer of graphene becomes a new electrochemical structure that we call a transelectrode. The trans-electrode's unique properties are the consequence of the atomic-scale proximity of its two opposing liquid-solid interfaces together with graphene's well known inplane conductivity. We show that several trans-electrode properties are revealed by ionic conductance measurements on a graphene membrane that separates two aqueous ionic solutions. Although our membranes are only one to two atomic layers(2,3) thick, we find they are remarkable ionic insulators with a very small stable conductance that depends on the ion species in solution. Electrical measurements on graphene membranes in which a single nanopore has been drilled show that the membrane's effective insulating thickness is less than one nanometre. This small effective thickness makes graphene an ideal substrate for very high resolution, high throughput nanopore-based single-molecule detectors. The sensitivity of graphene's in-plane electronic conductivity to its immediate surface environment and trans-membrane solution potentials will offer new insights into atomic surface processes and sensor development opportunities."], ["The onset of star formation 250 million years after the Big Bang", "A fundamental quest of modern astronomy is to locate the earliest galaxies and study how they influenced the intergalactic medium a few hundred million years after the Big Bang(1-3). The abundance of star-forming galaxies is known to decline(4,5) from redshifts of about 6 to 10, but a key question is the extent of star formation at even earlier times, corresponding to the period when the first galaxies might have emerged. Here we report spectroscopic observations of MACS1149-JD1(6), a gravitationally lensed galaxy observed when the Universe was less than four per cent of its present age. We detect an emission line of doubly ionized oxygen at a redshift of 9.1096 +/- 0.0006, with an uncertainty of one standard deviation. This precisely determined redshift indicates that the red rest-frame optical colour arises from a dominant stellar component that formed about 250 million years after the Big Bang, corresponding to a redshift of about 15. Our results indicate that it may be possible to detect such early episodes of star formation in similar galaxies with future telescopes."], ["Structure-based discovery of opioid analgesics with reduced side effects", "Morphine is an alkaloid from the opium poppy used to treat pain. The potentially lethal side effects of morphine and related opioids-which include fatal respiratory depression-are thought to be mediated by mu-opioid-receptor (mu OR) signalling through the beta-arrestin pathway or by actions at other receptors. Conversely, G-protein mu OR signalling is thought to confer analgesia. Here we computationally dock over 3 million molecules against the mu OR structure and identify new scaffolds unrelated to known opioids. Structure-based optimization yields PZM21-a potent G(i) activator with exceptional selectivity for mu OR and minimal beta-arrestin-2 recruitment. Unlike morphine, PZM21 is more efficacious for the affective component of analgesia versus the reflexive component and is devoid of both respiratory depression and morphine-like reinforcing activity in mice at equi-analgesic doses. PZM21 thus serves as both a probe to disentangle mu OR signalling and a therapeutic lead that is devoid of many of the side effects of current opioids."], ["A homochiral metal-organic porous material for enantioselective separation and catalysis", "Inorganic zeolites are used for many practical applications that exploit the microporosity intrinsic to their crystal structures. Organic analogues, which are assembled from modular organic building blocks linked through non-covalent interactions, are of interest for similar applications. These range from catalysis, separation and sensor technology to optoelectronics(1-3), with enantioselective separation and catalysis being especially important for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. The modular construction of these analogues allows flexible and rational design, as both the architecture and chemical functionality of the micropores can, in principle, be precisely controlled. Porous organic solids with large voids and high framework stability have been produced(14,15), and investigations into the range of accessible pore functionalities have been initiated(7,11,12,16-23). For example, catalytically active organic zeolite analogues are known(13,22,23), as are chiral metal-organic open-framework materials. However, the latter are only available as racemic mixtures(24,25), or lack the degree of framework stability or void space that is required for practical applications(26,27). Here we report the synthesis of a homochiral metal-organic porous material that allows the enantioselective inclusion of metal complexes in its pores and catalyses a transesterification reaction in an enantioselective manner. Our synthesis strategy, which uses enantiopure metal-organic clusters as secondary building blocks(14), should be readily applicable to chemically modified cluster components and thus provide access to a wide range of porous organic materials suitable for enantioselective separation and catalysis."], ["Transient Hoogsteen base pairs in canonical duplex DNA", "Sequence-directed variations in the canonical DNA double helix structure that retain Watson-Crick base-pairing have important roles in DNA recognition, topology and nucleosome positioning. By using nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation dispersion spectroscopy in concert with steered molecular dynamics simulations, we have observed transient sequence-specific excursions away from Watson-Crick base-pairing at CA and TA steps inside canonical duplex DNA towards low-populated and short-lived A.T and G.C Hoogsteen base pairs. The observation of Hoogsteen base pairs in DNA duplexes specifically bound to transcription factors and in damaged DNA sites implies that the DNA double helix intrinsically codes for excited state Hoogsteen base pairs as a means of expanding its structural complexity beyond that which can be achieved based on Watson-Crick base-pairing. The methods presented here provide a new route for characterizing transient low-populated nucleic acid structures, which we predict will be abundant in the genome and constitute a second transient layer of the genetic code."], ["LifeTime and improving European healthcare through cell-based interceptive medicine", "Here we describe the LifeTime Initiative, which aims to track, understand and target human cells during the onset and progression of complex diseases, and to analyse their response to therapy at single-cell resolution.

The analysis of large molecular and clinical datasets will identify molecular mechanisms, create predictive computational models of disease progression, and reveal new drug targets and therapies. The timely detection and interception of disease embedded in an ethical and patient-centred vision will be achieved through interactions across academia, hospitals, patient associations, health data management systems and industry. The application of this strategy to key medical challenges in cancer, neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, and infectious, chronic inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases at the single-cell level will usher in cell-based interceptive medicine in Europe over the next decade.

The twist angle strongly affects the electronic states, excitons and phonons of the twisted structures through interlayer coupling, giving rise to exotic optical, electric and spintronic behaviours(1-5). In twisted bilayer graphene, at certain twist angles, long-range periodicity associated with moire patterns introduces flat electronic bands and highly localized electronic states, resulting in Mott insulating behaviour and superconductivity(3,4). Theoretical studies suggest that these twist-induced phenomena are common to layered materials such as transition-metal dichalcogenides and black phosphorus(6,7). Twisted van der Waals structures are usually created using a transfer-stacking method, but this method cannot be used for materials with relatively strong interlayer binding. Facile bottom-up growth methods could provide an alternative means to create twisted van der Waals structures. Here we demonstrate that the Eshelby twist, which is associated with a screw dislocation (a chiral topological defect), can drive the formation of such structures on scales ranging from the nanoscale to the mesoscale. In the synthesis, axial screw dislocations are first introduced into nanowires growing along the stacking direction, yielding van der Waals nanostructures with continuous twisting in which the total twist rates are defined by the radii of the nanowires. Further radial growth of those twisted nanowires that are attached to the substrate leads to an increase in elastic energy, as the total twist rate is fixed by the substrate. The stored elastic energy can be reduced by accommodating the fixed twist rate in a series of discrete jumps. This yields mesoscale twisting structures consisting of a helical assembly of nanoplates demarcated by atomically sharp interfaces with a range of twist angles. We further show that the twisting topology can be tailored by controlling the radial size of the structure."], ["Trifluoromethylation of arenes and heteroarenes by means of photoredox catalysis", "Modern drug discovery relies on the continual development of synthetic methodology to address the many challenges associated with the design of new pharmaceutical agents(1). One such challenge arises from the enzymatic metabolism of drugs in vivo by cytochrome P450 oxidases, which use single-electron oxidative mechanisms to rapidly modify small molecules to facilitate their excretion(2). A commonly used synthetic strategy to protect against in vivo metabolism involves the incorporation of electron-withdrawing functionality, such as the trifluoromethyl (CF3) group, into drug candidates(3). The CF3 group enjoys a privileged role in the realm of medicinal chemistry because its incorporation into small molecules often enhances efficacy by promoting electrostatic interactions with targets, improving cellular membrane permeability, and increasing robustness towards oxidative metabolism of the drug(4-6). Although common pharmacophores often bear CF3 motifs in an aromatic system, access to such analogues typically requires the incorporation of the CF3 group, or a surrogate moiety, at the start of a multi-step synthetic sequence. Here we report a mild, operationally simple strategy for the direct trifluoromethylation of unactivated arenes and heteroarenes through a radical-mediated mechanism using commercial photocatalysts and a household light bulb. We demonstrate the broad utility of this transformation through addition of CF3 to a number of heteroaromatic and aromatic systems. The benefit to medicinal chemistry and applicability to late-stage drug development is also shown through examples of the direct trifluoromethylation of widely prescribed pharmaceutical agents."], ["The role of proton coupled electron transfer in water oxidation", "Water oxidation is a key half reaction in energy conversion schemes based on solar fuels and targets such as light driven water splitting or carbon dioxide reduction into CO, other oxygenates, or hydrocarbons. Carrying out these reactions at rates that exceed the rate of solar insolation for the extended periods of time required for useful applications presents a major challenge. Water oxidation is the key \u201cother\u201d half reaction in these schemes and it is dominated by PCET given its multi-electron, multi-proton character, 2H2O \u2192 O2 + 4e\u2212 + 4H+. Identification of PCET was an offshoot of experiments designed to investigate energy conversion by electron transfer quenching of molecular excited states. The concepts \u201credox potential leveling\u201d and concerted electron\u2013proton transfer came from measurements on stepwise oxidation of cis-RuII(bpy)2(py)(OH2)2+ to RuIV(bpy)2(py)(O)2+. The Ru \u201cblue dimer\u201d, cis,cis-(bpy)2(H2O)RuORu(OH2)(bpy)24+, was the first designed catalyst for water oxidation. It undergoes oxidative activation by PCET to give the transient (bpy)2(O)RuVORuV(O)(bpy)24+, O-atom attack on water to give a peroxidic intermediate, and further oxidation and O2 release. More recently, a class of single site water oxidation catalysts has been identified, e.g., Ru(tpy)(bpm)(OH2)2+ (tpy is 2,2\u2032:6\u2032,2\u2032\u2032-terpyridine; bpm is 2,2\u2032-bipyrimidine). They undergo stepwise PCET oxidation to RuIV=O2+ or RuV(O)3+ followed by O-atom transfer with formation of peroxidic intermediates which undergo further oxidation and O2 release. PCET plays a key role in the three zones of water oxidation reactivity: oxidative activation, O\u22efO bond formation, oxidation and O2 release from peroxidic intermediates. Similar schemes have been identified for electrocatalytic water oxidation on oxide electrode surfaces based on phosphonated derivatives such as [Ru(Mebimpy)(4,4\u2032-(PO3H2CH2)2bpy)(OH2)]2+. A PCET barrier to RuIII\u2013OH2+ \u2192 RuIV=O2+ oxidation arises from the large difference in pKa values between RuIII\u2013OH2+ and RuIV(OH)3+. On oxide surfaces this oxidation occurs by multiple pathways. Kinetic, mechanistic, and DFT results on single site catalysts reveal a new pathway for the O\u22efO bond forming step (Atom-Proton Transfer, APT), significant rate enhancements by added proton acceptor bases, and accelerated water oxidation in propylene carbonate as solvent with water added as a stoichiometric reagent. Lessons learned about water oxidation and the role of PCET and concerted pathways appear to have direct relevance for water oxidation in Photosystem II (PSII) with PSII a spectacular example of PCET in action. This includes a key role for Multiple Site-Electron Proton Transfer in oxidative activation of the Oxygen Evolving Complex (OEC) in the S0 \u2192 S1 transition in the Kok cycle."], ["Electric-field-tuned topological phase transition in ultrathin Na<sub>3</sub>Bi", "The electric-field-induced quantum phase transition from topological to conventional insulator has been proposed as the basis of a topological field effect transistor(1-4). In this scheme, 'on' is the ballistic flow of charge and spin along dissipationless edges of a two-dimensional quantum spin Hall insulator(5-9), and 'off ' is produced by applying an electric field that converts the exotic insulator to a conventional insulator with no conductive channels. Such a topological transistor is promising for low-energy logic circuits(4), which would necessitate electric-field-switched materials with conventional and topological bandgaps much greater than the thermal energy at room temperature, substantially greater than proposed so far(6-8). Topological Dirac semimetals are promising systems in which to look for topological field-effect switching, as they lie at the boundary between conventional and topological phases(3,10-16). Here we use scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy to show that mono- and bilayer films of the topological Dirac semimetal(3,17) Na3Bi are two-dimensional topological insulators with bulk bandgaps greater than 300 millielectronvolts owing to quantum confinement in the absence of electric field. On application of electric field by doping with potassium or by close approach of the scanning tunnelling microscope tip, the Stark effect completely closes the bandgap and re-opens it as a conventional gap of 90 millielectronvolts. The large bandgaps in both the conventional and quantum spin Hall phases, much greater than the thermal energy at room temperature (25 millielectronvolts), suggest that ultrathin Na3Bi is suitable for room-temperature topological transistor operation."], ["Probing sporadic and familial Alzheimer's disease using induced pluripotent stem cells", "Our understanding of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis is currently limited by difficulties in obtaining live neurons from patients and the inability to model the sporadic form of the disease. It may be possible to overcome these challenges by reprogramming primary cells from patients into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Here we reprogrammed primary fibroblasts from two patients with familial Alzheimer's disease, both caused by a duplication of the amyloid-beta precursor protein gene(1) (APP; termed APP(Dp)), two with sporadic Alzheimer's disease (termed sAD1, sAD2) and two non-demented control individuals into iPSC lines. Neurons from differentiated cultures were purified with fluorescence-activated cell sorting and characterized. Purified cultures contained more than 90% neurons, clustered with fetal brain messenger RNA samples by microarray criteria, and could form functional synaptic contacts. Virtually all cells exhibited normal electrophysiological activity. Relative to controls, iPSC-derived, purified neurons from the two APP(Dp) patients and patient sAD2 exhibited significantly higher levels of the pathological markers amyloid-beta(1-40), phospho-tau(Thr 231) and active glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (aGSK-3 beta). Neurons from APP(Dp) and sAD2 patients also accumulated large RAB5-positive early endosomes compared to controls. Treatment of purified neurons with beta-secretase inhibitors, but not gamma-secretase inhibitors, caused significant reductions in phospho-Tau(Thr 231) and aGSK-3 beta levels. These results suggest a direct relationship between APP proteolytic processing, but not amyloid-beta, in GSK-3 beta activation and tau phosphorylation in human neurons. Additionally, we observed that neurons with the genome of one sAD patient exhibited the phenotypes seen in familial Alzheimer's disease samples. More generally, we demonstrate that iPSC technology can be used to observe phenotypes relevant to Alzheimer's disease, even though it can take decades for overt disease to manifest in patients."], ["Spreading of nanofluids on solids", "Suspensions of nanometre-sized particles (nanofluids) are used in a variety of technological contexts. For example, their spreading and adhesion behaviour on solid surfaces can yield materials with desirable structural and optical properties(1). Similarly, the spreading behaviour of nanofluids containing surfactant micelles has implications for soil remediation, oily soil removal, lubrication and enhanced oil recovery. But the well-established concepts of spreading and adhesion of simple liquids do not apply to nanofluids(2-7). Theoretical investigations have suggested that a solid-like ordering of suspended spheres will occur in the confined three-phase contact region at the edge of the spreading fluid, becoming more disordered and fluid-like towards the bulk phase(8,9). Calculations have also suggested that the pressure arising from such colloidal ordering in the confined region will enhance the spreading behaviour of nanofluids(10,11). Here we use video microscopy to demonstrate both the two-dimensional crystal-like ordering of charged nanometre-sized polystyrene spheres in water, and the enhanced spreading dynamics of a micellar fluid, at the three-phase contact region. Our findings suggest a new mechanism for oily soil removal-detergency."], ["Water structural transformation at molecular hydrophobic interfaces", "Hydrophobic hydration is considered to have a key role in biological processes ranging from membrane formation to protein folding and ligand binding(1). Historically, hydrophobic hydration shells were thought to resemble solid clathrate hydrates(2-4), with solutes surrounded by polyhedral cages composed of tetrahedrally hydrogen-bonded water molecules. But more recent experimental(5-8) and theoretical(9-16) studies have challenged this view and emphasized the importance of the length scales involved. Here we report combined polarized, isotopic and temperature-dependent Raman scattering measurements with multivariate curve resolution (Raman-MCR)(17-19) that explore hydrophobic hydration by mapping the vibrational spectroscopic features arising from the hydrophobic hydration shells of linear alcohols ranging from methanol to heptanol. Our data, covering the entire 0-100 degrees C temperature range, show clear evidence that at low temperatures the hydration shells have a hydrophobically enhanced water structure with greater tetrahedral order and fewer weak hydrogen bonds than the surrounding bulk water. This structure disappears with increasing temperature and is then, for hydrophobic chains longer than similar to 1 nm, replaced by a more disordered structure with weaker hydrogen bonds than bulk water. These observations support our current understanding of hydrophobic hydration, including the thermally induced water structural transformation that is suggestive of the hydrophobic crossover predicted to occur at lengths of similar to 1 nm (refs 5, 9, 10, 14)."], ["Structural basis of G-quadruplex unfolding by the DEAH/RHA helicase DHX36", "Guanine-rich nucleic acid sequences challenge the replication, transcription, and translation machinery by spontaneously folding into G-quadruplexes, the unfolding of which requires forces greater than most polymerases can exert(1,2). Eukaryotic cells contain numerous helicases that can unfold G-quadruplexes(3). The molecular basis of the recognition and unfolding of G-quadruplexes by helicases remains poorly understood. DHX36 (also known as RHAU and G4R1), a member of the DEAH/RHA family of helicases, binds both DNA and RNA G-quadruplexes with extremely high affinity(4-6), is consistently found bound to G-quadruplexes in and is a major source of G-quadruplex unfolding activity in HeLa cell lysates(6). DHX36 is a multi-functional helicase that has been implicated in G-quadruplex-mediated transcriptional and post transcriptional regulation, and is essential for heart development, haematopoiesis, and embryogenesis in mice(9-12). Here we report the co-crystal structure of bovine DHX36 bound to a DNA with a G-quadruplex and a 3' single-stranded DNA segment. We show that the N-terminal DHX36-specific motif folds into a DNA binding-induced alpha-helix that, together with the OB-fold-like subdomain, selectively binds parallel G-quadruplexes. Comparison with unliganded and ATP-analogue-bound DHX36 structures, together with single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis, suggests that G-quadruplex binding alone induces rearrangements of the helicase core; by pulling on the single-stranded DNA tail, these rearrangements drive G-quadruplex unfolding one residue at a time."], ["EFFECT OF ELECTROLYTES ON BUBBLE COALESCENCE", "THE foaminess of ocean waves, relative to fresh water, has long been attributed to the effect of salts in reducing bubble coalescence9. This phenomenon is exploited in extraction processes using froth flotation1, in which the extraction efficiency increases as the bubble size gets smaller. But whereas the bubble-stabilizing effect of surfactants is well understood, the effect of salts is not; the fact that salts decrease the surface tension of water and that they are desorbed from the air-water interface would, if anything, be expected to destabilize bubbles. Here we report the results of experiments conducted to study the stabilization of bubbles by salts. We find that bubble coalescence is inhibited by some salts whereas others have no effect and that this inhibition occurs only upon the 'matching' of a two-valued empirical property assigned to each anion and cation. We believe these observations can be explained only by the local influence of the ions on water structure, possibly in a way related to the hydrophobic interaction2-8."], ["p63 protects the female germ line during meiotic arrest", "Meiosis in the female germ line of mammals is distinguished by a prolonged arrest in prophase of meiosis I between homologous chromosome recombination and ovulation(1). How DNA damage is detected in these arrested oocytes is poorly understood, but it is variably thought to involve p53, a central tumour suppressor in mammals(2-4). While the function of p53 in monitoring the genome of somatic cells is clear, a consensus for the importance of p53 for germ line integrity has yet to emerge. Here we show that the p53 homologue p63 (refs 5, 6), and specifically the TAp63 isoform, is constitutively expressed in female germ cells during meiotic arrest and is essential in a process of DNA damage-induced oocyte death not involving p53. We also show that DNA damage induces both the phosphorylation of p63 and its binding to p53 cognate DNA sites and that these events are linked to oocyte death. Our data support a model whereby p63 is the primordial member of the p53 family and acts in a conserved process of monitoring the integrity of the female germ line, whereas the functions of p53 are restricted to vertebrate somatic cells for tumour suppression. These findings have implications for understanding female germ line fidelity, the regulation of fertility and the evolution of tumour suppressor mechanisms."], ["Beating the Stoner criterion using molecular interfaces", "Only three elements are ferromagnetic at room temperature: the transition metals iron, cobalt and nickel. The Stoner criterion explains why iron is ferromagnetic but manganese, for example, is not, even though both elements have an unfilled 3d shell and are adjacent in the periodic table: according to this criterion, the product of the density of states and the exchange integral must be greater than unity for spontaneous spin ordering to emerge(1,2). Here we demonstrate that it is possible to alter the electronic states of non-ferromagnetic materials, such as diamagnetic copper and paramagnetic manganese, to overcome the Stoner criterion and make them ferromagnetic at room temperature. This effect is achieved via interfaces between metallic thin films and C-60 molecular layers. The emergent ferromagnetic state exists over several layers of the metal before being quenched at large sample thicknesses by the material's bulk properties. Although the induced magnetization is easily measurable by magnetometry, low-energy muon spin spectroscopy(3) provides insight into its distribution by studying the depolarization process of low-energy muons implanted in the sample. This technique indicates localized spin-ordered states at, and close to, the metal-molecule interface. Density functional theory simulations suggest a mechanism based on magnetic hardening of the metal atoms, owing to electron transfer(4,5). This mechanism might allow for the exploitation of molecular coupling to design magnetic metamaterials using abundant, non-toxic components such as organic semiconductors. Charge transfer at molecular interfaces may thus be used to control spin polarization or magnetization, with consequences for the design of devices for electronic, power or computing applications (see, for example, refs 6 and 7)."], ["White-Light Emission and Structural Distortion in New Corrugated Two-Dimensional Lead Bromide Perovskites", "Hybrid inorganic\u2013organic perovskites are developing rapidly as high performance semiconductors. Recently, two-dimensional (2D) perovskites were found to have white-light, broadband emission in the visible range that was attributed mainly to the role of self-trapped excitons (STEs). Here, we describe three new 2D lead bromide perovskites incorporating a series of bifunctional ammonium dications as templates which also emit white light: (1) \u03b1-(DMEN)PbBr4 (DMEN = 2-(dimethylamino)ethylamine), which adopts a unique corrugated layered structure in space group Pbca with unit cell a = 18.901(4) \u00c5, b = 11.782(2) \u00c5, and c = 23.680(5) \u00c5; (2) (DMAPA)PbBr4 (DMAPA = 3-(dimethylamino)-1-propylamine), which crystallizes in P21/c with a = 10.717(2) \u00c5, b = 11.735(2) \u00c5, c = 12.127(2) \u00c5, and \u03b2 = 111.53(3)\u00b0; and (3) (DMABA)PbBr4 (DMABA = 4-dimethylaminobutylamine), which adopts Aba2 with a = 41.685(8) \u00c5, b = 23.962(5) \u00c5, and c = 12.000(2) \u00c5. Photoluminescence (PL) studies show a correlation between the distortion of the \u201cPbBr6\u201d octahedron in the 2D layer and the broadening of PL emission, with the most distorted structure having the broadest emission (183 nm full width at half-maximum) and longest lifetime (\u03c4avg = 1.39 ns). The most distorted member \u03b1-(DMEN)PbBr4 exhibits white-light emission with a color rendering index (CRI) of 73 which is similar to a fluorescent light source and correlated color temperature (CCT) of 7863 K, producing \u201ccold\u201d white light."], ["Magnetic-field-induced shape recovery by reverse phase transformation", "Large magnetic-field-induced strains(1) have been observed in Heusler alloys with a body-centred cubic ordered structure and have been explained by the rearrangement of martensite structural variants due to an external magnetic field(1-3). These materials have attracted considerable attention as potential magnetic actuator materials. Here we report the magnetic-field-induced shape recovery of a compressively deformed NiCoMnIn alloy. Stresses of over 100 MPa are generated in the material on the application of a magnetic field of 70 kOe; such stress levels are approximately 50 times larger than that generated in a previous ferromagnetic shape-memory alloy(4). We observed 3 per cent deformation and almost full recovery of the original shape of the alloy. We attribute this deformation behaviour to a reverse transformation from the antiferromagnetic (or paramagnetic) martensitic to the ferromagnetic parent phase at 298 K in the Ni45Co5Mn36.7In13.3 single crystal."], ["Nitrogen reduction by the Fe sites of synthetic [Mo<sub>3</sub>S<sub>4</sub>Fe] cubes", "Nitrogen (N-2) fixation by nature, which is a crucial process for the supply of bio-available forms of nitrogen, is performed by nitrogenase. This enzyme uses a unique transition-metal-sulfur-carbon cluster as its active-site co-factor ([(R-homocitrate)MoFe7S9C], FeMoco)(1,2), and the sulfur-surrounded iron (Fe) atoms have been postulated to capture and reduce N-2 (refs.(3-6)). Although there are a few examples of synthetic counterparts of the FeMoco, metal-sulfur cluster, which have shown binding of N-2 (refs.(7-9)), the reduction of N-2 by any synthetic metal-sulfur cluster or by the extracted form of FeMoco(10) has remained elusive, despite nearly 50 years of research. Here we show that the Fe atoms in our synthetic [Mo3S4Fe] cubes(11,12) can capture a N-2 molecule and catalyse N-2 silylation to form N(SiMe3)(3) under treatment with excess sodium and trimethylsilyl chloride. These results exemplify the catalytic silylation of N-2 by a synthetic metal-sulfur cluster and demonstrate the N-2-reduction capability of Fe atoms in a sulfur-rich environment, which is reminiscent of the ability of FeMoco to bind and activate N-2."], ["Giant osmotic energy conversion measured in a single transmembrane boron nitride nanotube", "New models of fluid transport are expected to emerge from the confinement of liquids at the nanoscale(1,2), with potential applications in ultrafiltration, desalination and energy conversion(3). Nevertheless, advancing our fundamental understanding of fluid transport on the smallest scales requires mass and ion dynamics to be ultimately characterized across an individual channel to avoid averaging over many pores. A major challenge for nanofluidics thus lies in building distinct and well-controlled nanochannels, amenable to the systematic exploration of their properties. Here we describe the fabrication and use of a hierarchical nanofluidic device made of a boron nitride nanotube that pierces an ultrathin membrane and connects two fluid reservoirs. Such a transmembrane geometry allows the detailed study of fluidic transport through a single nanotube under diverse forces, including electric fields, pressure drops and chemical gradients. Using this device, we discover very large, osmotically induced electric currents generated by salinity gradients, exceeding by two orders of magnitude their pressure-driven counterpart. We show that this result originates in the anomalously high surface charge carried by the nanotube's internal surface in water at large pH, which we independently quantify in conductance measurements. The nano-assembly route using nanostructures as building blocks opens the way to studying fluid, ionic and molecule transport on the nanoscale, and may lead to biomimetic functionalities. Our results furthermore suggest that boron nitride nanotubes could be used as membranes for osmotic power harvesting under salinity gradients."], ["Fast two-qubit logic with holes in germanium", "Universal quantum information processing requires the execution of single-qubit and two-qubit logic. Across all qubit realizations(1), spin qubits in quantum dots have great promise to become the central building block for quantum computation(2). Excellent quantum dot control can be achieved in gallium arsenide(3-5), and high-fidelity qubit rotations and two-qubit logic have been demonstrated in silicon(6-9), but universal quantum logic implemented with local control has yet to be demonstrated. Here we make this step by combining all of these desirable aspects using hole quantum dots in germanium. Good control over tunnel coupling and detuning is obtained by exploiting quantum wells with very low disorder, enabling operation at the charge symmetry point for increased qubit performance. Spin-orbit coupling obviates the need for microscopic elements close to each qubit and enables rapid qubit control with driving frequencies exceeding 100 MHz. We demonstrate a fast universal quantum gate set composed of single-qubit gates with a fidelity of 99.3 per cent and a gate time of 20 nanoseconds, and two-qubit logic operations executed within 75 nanoseconds. Planar germanium has thus matured within a year from a material that can host quantum dots to a platform enabling two-qubit logic, positioning itself as an excellent material for use in quantum information applications. Spin qubits based on hole states in strained germanium could offer the most scalable platform for quantum computation."], ["Reconstruction and control of a time-dependent two-electron wave packet", "The concerted motion of two or more bound electrons governs atomic(1) and molecular(2,3) non-equilibrium processes including chemical reactions, and hence there is much interest in developing a detailed understanding of such electron dynamics in the quantum regime. However, there is no exact solution for the quantum three-body problem, and as a result even the minimal system of two active electrons and a nucleus is analytically intractable(4). This makes experimental measurements of the dynamics of two bound and correlated electrons, as found in the helium atom, an attractive prospect. However, although the motion of single active electrons and holes has been observed with attosecond time resolution(5-7), comparable experiments on two-electron motion have so far remained out of reach. Here we show that a correlated two-electron wave packet can be reconstructed from a 1.2-femtosecond quantum beat among low-lying doubly excited states in helium. The beat appears in attosecond transient-absorption spectra(5,7-9) measured with unprecedentedly high spectral resolution and in the presence of an intensity-tunable visible laser field. We tune the coupling(10-12) between the two low-lying quantum states by adjusting the visible laser intensity, and use the Fano resonance as a phase-sensitive quantum interferometer(13) to achieve coherent control of the two correlated electrons. Given the excellent agreement with large-scalequantum-mechanical calculations for the helium atom, we anticipate that multidimensional spectroscopy experiments of the type we report here will provide benchmark data for testing fundamental few-body quantum dynamics theory in more complex systems. They might also provide a route to the site-specific measurement and control of metastable electronic transition states that are at the heart of fundamental chemical reactions."], ["Evidence of high-temperature exciton condensation in two-dimensional atomic double layers", "A Bose-Einstein condensate is the ground state of a dilute gas of bosons, such as atoms cooled to temperatures close to absolute zero(1). With much smaller mass, excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) are expected to condense at considerably higher temperatures(2-7). Two-dimensional van der Waals semiconductors with very strong exciton binding are ideal systems for the study of high-temperature exciton condensation. Here we study electrically generated interlayer excitons in MoSe2-WSe2 atomic double layers with a density of up to 10(12) excitons per square centimetre. The interlayer tunnelling current depends only on the exciton density, which is indicative of correlated electron-hole pair tunnelling(8). Strong electroluminescence arises when a hole tunnels from WSe2 to recombine with an electron in MoSe2. We observe a critical threshold dependence of the electroluminescence intensity on exciton density, accompanied by super-Poissonian photon statistics near the threshold, and a large electroluminescence enhancement with a narrow peak at equal electron and hole densities. The phenomenon persists above 100 kelvin, which is consistent with the predicted critical condensation temperature(9-12). Our study provides evidence for interlayer exciton condensation in two-dimensional atomic double layers and opens up opportunities for exploring condensate-based optoelectronics and exciton-mediated high-temperature superconductivity(13)."], ["Functionalizing hydrogen-bonded surface networks with self-assembled monolayers", "One of the central challenges in nanotechnology is the development of flexible and efficient methods for creating ordered structures with nanometre precision over an extended length scale. Supramolecular self- assembly on surfaces offers attractive features in this regard: it is a 'bottom- up' approach and thus allows the simple and rapid creation of surface assemblies(1,2), which are readily tuned through the choice of molecular building blocks used and stabilized by hydrogen bonding(3-8), van der Waals interactions(9), pi-pi bonding(10,11) or metal coordination(12,13) between the blocks. Assemblies in the form of two- dimensional open networks(3,9,10,13-17) are of particular interest for possible applications because well- defined pores can be used for the precise localization and confinement of guest entities such as molecules or clusters, which can add functionality to the supramolecular network. Another widely used method for producing surface structures involves self- assembled monolayers (SAMs)(18), which have introduced unprecedented flexibility in our ability to tailor interfaces and generate patterned surfaces(19-22). But SAMs are part of a top-down technology that is limited in terms of the spatial resolution that can be achieved. We therefore rationalized that a particularly powerful fabrication platform might be realized by combining non- covalent self- assembly of porous networks and SAMs, with the former providing nanometre- scale precision and the latter allowing versatile functionalization. Here we show that the two strategies can indeed be combined to create integrated network SAM hybrid systems that are sufficiently robust for further processing. We show that the supramolecular network and the SAM can both be deposited from solution, which should enable the widespread and flexible use of this combined fabrication method."], ["Atomic imaging of zeolite-confined single molecules by electron microscopy", "Single-molecule imaging with atomic resolution is a notable method to study various molecular behaviours and interactions(1-5). Although low-dose electron microscopy has been proved effective in observing small molecules(6-13), it has not yet helped us achieve an atomic understanding ofthe basic physics and chemistry of single molecules in porous materials, such as zeolites(14-16.) The configurations of small molecules interacting with acid sites determine the wide applications of zeolites in catalysis, adsorption, gas separation and energy storage(17-21). Here we report the atomic imaging of single pyridine and thiophene confined in the channel of zeolite ZSM-5 (ref.(22)). On the basis of integrated differential phase contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (i DPC-STEM)(23-25), we directly observe the adsorption and desorption behaviours of pyridines in ZSM-5 underthe in situ atmosphere. The adsorption configuration of single pyridine is atomically resolved and the S atoms in thiophenes are located after comparing imaging results with calculations. The strong interactions between molecules and acid sites can be visually studied in real-space images. This work provides a general strategy to directly observe these molecular structures and interactions in both the static image and the in situ experiment, expanding the applications of electron microscopy to the further study ofvarious single-molecule behaviours with high resolution."], ["Synthetic Landau levels for photons", "Synthetic photonic materials are an emerging platform for exploring the interface between microscopic quantum dynamics and macroscopic material properties(1-5). Photons experiencing a Lorentz force develop handedness, providing opportunities to study quantum Hall physics and topological quantum science(6-8). Here we present an experimental realization of a magnetic field for continuum photons. We trap optical photons in a multimode ring resonator to make a two-dimensional gas of massive bosons, and then employ a non-planar geometry to induce an image rotation on each round-trip(9). This results in photonic Coriolis/Lorentz and centrifugal forces and so realizes the Fock-Darwin Hamiltonian for photons in a magnetic field and harmonic trap(10). Using spatial-and energy-resolved spectroscopy, we track the resulting photonic eigenstates as radial trapping is reduced, finally observing a photonic Landau level at degeneracy. To circumvent the challenge of trap instability at the centrifugal limit(10,11), we constrain the photons to move on a cone. Spectroscopic probes demonstrate flat space (zero curvature) away from the cone tip. At the cone tip, we observe that spatial curvature increases the local density of states, and we measure fractional state number excess consistent with the Wen-Zee theory, providing an experimental test of this theory of electrons in both a magnetic field and curved space(12-15). This work opens the door to exploration of the interplay of geometry and topology, and in conjunction with Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency, enables studies of photonic fractional quantum Hall fluids(16,17) and direct detection of anyons(18,19)."], ["Ge/Si nanowire heterostructures as high-performance field-effect transistors", "Semiconducting carbon nanotubes(1,2) and nanowires(3) are potential alternatives to planar metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs)(4) owing, for example, to their unique electronic structure and reduced carrier scattering caused by one-dimensional quantum confinement effects(1,5). Studies have demonstrated long carrier mean free paths at room temperature in both carbon nanotubes1,6 and Ge/Si core/shell nanowires(7). In the case of carbon nanotube FETs, devices have been fabricated that work close to the ballistic limit(8). Applications of high-performance carbon nanotube FETs have been hindered, however, by difficulties in producing uniform semiconducting nanotubes, a factor not limiting nanowires, which have been prepared with reproducible electronic properties in high yield as required for large-scale integrated systems(3,9,10). Yet whether nanowire field-effect transistors (NWFETs) can indeed outperform their planar counterparts is still unclear(4). Here we report studies on Ge/Si core/shell nanowire heterostructures configured as FETs using high-kappa dielectrics in a top-gate geometry. The clean one-dimensional hole-gas in the Ge/Si nanowire heterostructures(7) and enhanced gate coupling with high-kappa dielectrics give high-performance FETs values of the scaled transconductance (3.3 mS mu m(-1)) and on-current (2.1 mA mu m(-1)) that are three to four times greater than state-of-the-art MOSFETs and are the highest obtained on NWFETs. Furthermore, comparison of the intrinsic switching delay, tau = CV/I, which represents a key metric for device applications(4,11), shows that the performance of Ge/Si NWFETs is comparable to similar length carbon nanotube FETs and substantially exceeds the length-dependent scaling of planar silicon MOSFETs."], ["Efficient and stable emission of warm-white light from lead-free halide double perovskites", "Lighting accounts for one-fifth of global electricity consumption(1). Single materials with efficient and stable white-light emission are ideal for lighting applications, but photon emission covering the entire visible spectrum is difficult to achieve using a single material. Metal halide perovskites have outstanding emission properties(2,3); however, the best-performing materials of this type contain lead and have unsatisfactory stability. Here we report a lead-free double perovskite that exhibits efficient and stable white-light emission via self-trapped excitons that originate from the Jahn-Teller distortion of the AgCl6 octahedron in the excited state. By alloying sodium cations into Cs2AgInCl6, we break the dark transition (the inversion-symmetry-induced parity-forbidden transition) by manipulating the parity of the wavefunction of the self-trapped exciton and reduce the electronic dimensionality of the semiconductor(4). This leads to an increase in photoluminescence efficiency by three orders of magnitude compared to pure Cs2AgInCl6. The optimally alloyed Cs-2(Ag0.60Na0.40) InCl6 with 0.04 per cent bismuth doping emits warm-white light with 86 +/- 5 per cent quantum efficiency and works for over 1,000 hours.

Unfortunately, perfect periodic domain ordering can only be achieved over micrometre-scale areas at best(12,13) and defects exist at the edges of grain boundaries. These limitations preclude the use of block-copolymer lithography for many advanced applications(14). Graphoepitaxy(12,15), in-plane electric fields(3,16), temperature gradients(17), and directional solidification(14,18) have also been demonstrated to induce orientation or long-range order with varying degrees of success. Here we demonstrate the integration of thin films of block copolymer with advanced lithographic techniques to induce epitaxial self-assembly of domains. The resulting patterns are defect-free, are oriented and registered with the underlying substrate and can be created over arbitrarily large areas. These structures are determined by the size and quality of the lithographically defined surface pattern rather than by the inherent limitations of the self-assembly process.

Here we describe two novel and specific approaches to profile the genomic localization of 5hmC. The first approach, termed GLIB (glucosylation, periodate oxidation, biotinylation) uses a combination of enzymatic and chemical steps to isolate DNA fragments containing as few as a single 5hmC. The second approach involves conversion of 5hmC to cytosine 5-methylenesulphonate (CMS) by treatment of genomic DNA with sodium bisulphite, followed by immunoprecipitation of CMS-containing DNA with a specific antiserum to CMS5. High-throughput sequencing of 5hmC-containing DNA from mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells showed strong enrichment within exons and near transcriptional start sites. 5hmC was especially enriched at the start sites of genes whose promoters bear dual histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) marks. Our results indicate that 5hmC has a probable role in transcriptional regulation, and suggest a model in which 5hmC contributes to the 'poised' chromatin signature found at developmentally-regulated genes in ES cells."], ["First dairying in green Saharan Africa in the fifth millennium BC", "In the prehistoric green Sahara of Holocene North Africa-in contrast to the Neolithic of Europe and Eurasia-a reliance on cattle, sheep and goats emerged as a stable and widespread way of life, long before the first evidence for domesticated plants or settled village farming communities(1-3). The remarkable rock art found widely across the region depicts cattle herding among early Saharan pastoral groups, and includes rare scenes of milking; however, these images can rarely be reliably dated(4). Although the faunal evidence provides further confirmation of the importance of cattle and other domesticates(5), the scarcity of cattle bones makes it impossible to ascertain herd structures via kill-off patterns, thereby precluding interpretations of whether dairying was practiced. Because pottery production begins early in northern Africa(6) the potential exists to investigate diet and subsistence practices using molecular and isotopic analyses of absorbed food residues(7). This approach has been successful in determining the chronology of dairying beginning in the 'Fertile Crescent' of the Near East and its spread across Europe(8-11). Here we report the first unequivocal chemical evidence, based on the delta C-13 and Delta C-13 values of the major alkanoic acids of milk fat, for the adoption of dairying practices by prehistoric Saharan African people in the fifth millennium BC. Interpretations are supported by a new database of modern ruminant animal fats collected from Africa. These findings confirm the importance of 'lifetime products', such as milk, in early Saharan pastoralism, and provide an evolutionary context for the emergence of lactase persistence in Africa."], ["The importance of repairing stalled replication forks", "The bacterial SOS response to unusual levels of DNA damage has been recognized and studied for several decades. Pathways for re-establishing inactivated replication forks under normal growth conditions have received far less attention. In bacteria growing aerobically in the absence of SOS-inducing conditions, many replication forks encounter DNA damage, leading to inactivation. The pathways for fork reactivation involve the homologous recombination systems, are nonmutagenic, and integrate almost every aspect of DNA metabolism. On a frequency-of-use basis, these pathways represent the main function of bacterial DNA recombination systems, as well as the main function of a number of other enzymatic systems that are associated with replication and site-specific recombination."], ["Additive manufacturing of micro-architected metals via hydrogel infusion", "Metal additive manufacturing (AM) enables the production of high value and high performance components(1) with applications from aerospace(2) to biomedical(3) fields. Layer-by-layer fabrication circumvents the geometric limitations of traditional metalworking techniques, allowing topologically optimized parts to be made rapidly and efficiently(4,5). Existing AM techniques rely on thermally initiated melting or sintering for part shaping, a costly and material-limited process(6-8). We report an AM technique that produces metals and alloys with microscale resolution via vat photopolymerization (VP). Three-dimensional-architected hydrogels are infused with metal precursors, then calcined and reduced to convert the hydrogel scaffolds into miniaturized metal replicas. This approach represents a paradigm shift in VP; the material is selected only after the structure is fabricated. Unlike existing VP strategies, which incorporate target materials or precursors into the photoresin during printing(9-11), our method does not require reoptimization of resins and curing parameters for different materials, enabling quick iteration, compositional tuning and the ability to fabricate multimaterials. We demonstrate AM of metals with critical dimensions of approximately 40 mu m that are challenging to fabricate by using conventional processes. Such hydrogel-derived metals have highly twinned microstructures and unusually high hardness, providing a pathway to create advanced metallic micromaterials."], ["Herbivory-induced volatiles elicit defence genes in lima bean leaves", "In response to herbivore damage, several plant species emit volatiles that attract natural predators of the attacking herbivores(1-5). Using spider mites (Tetranychus urticae) and predatory mites (Phytoseiulus persimilis)(1-4), it has been shown that not only the attacked plant but also neighbouring plants are affected, becoming more attractive to predatory mites(3,6) and less susceptible to spider mites(6). The mechanism involved in such interactions, however, remains elusive. Here we show that uninfested lima bean leaves activate five separate defence genes when exposed to volatiles from conspecific leaves infested with T. urticae, but not when exposed to volatiles from artificially wounded leaves. The expression pattern of these genes is similar to that produced by exposure to jasmonic acid. At least three terpenoids in the volatiles are responsible for this gene activation; they are released in response to herbivory but not artificial wounding. Expression of these genes requires calcium influx and protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation."], ["Quantum anomalous Hall effect from intertwined moire bands", "Electron correlation and topology are two central threads of modern condensed matter physics. Semiconductor moire materials provide a highly tuneable platform for studies of electron correlation(1-12). Correlation-driven phenomena, including the Mott insulator(2-5), generalized Wigner crystals(2,6,9), stripe phases(10) and continuous Mott transition(11,12), have been demonstrated. However, non-trivial band topology has remained unclear. Here we report the observation of a quantum anomalous Hall effect in AB-stacked MoTe2 /WSe2 moire heterobilayers. Unlike in the AA-stacked heterobilayers(11), an out-of-plane electric field not only controls the bandwidth but also the band topology by intertwining moire bands centred at different layers. At half band filling, corresponding to one particle per moire unit cell, we observe quantized Hall resistance, h/e(2) (with h and e denoting the Planck's constant and electron charge, respectively), and vanishing longitudinal resistance at zero magnetic field. The electric-field-induced topological phase transition from a Mott insulator to a quantum anomalous Hall insulator precedes an insulator-to-metal transition. Contrary to most known topological phase transitions(13), it is not accompanied by a bulk charge gap closure. Our study paves the way for discovery of emergent phenomena arising from the combined influence of strong correlation and topology in semiconductor moire materials."], ["Omicron escapes the majority of existing SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies", "The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant contains 15 mutations of the receptor-binding domain (RBD). How Omicron evades RBD-targeted neutralizing antibodies requires immediate investigation. Here we use high-throughput yeast display screening(1,2) to determine the profiles of RBD escaping mutations for 247 human anti-RBD neutralizing antibodies and show that the neutralizing antibodies can be classified by unsupervised clustering into six epitope groups (A-F)-a grouping that is highly concordant with knowledge-based structural classifications(3-5). Various single mutations of Omicron can impair neutralizing antibodies of different epitope groups. Specifically, neutralizing antibodies in groups A-D, the epitopes of which overlap with the ACE2-binding motif, are largely escaped by K417N, G446S, E484A and Q493R. Antibodies in group E (for example, S309)(6) and group F (for example, CR3022)(7), which often exhibit broad sarbecovirus neutralizing activity, are less affected by Omicron, but a subset of neutralizing antibodies are still escaped by G339D, N440K and S371L. Furthermore, Omicron pseudovirus neutralization showed that neutralizing antibodies that sustained single mutations could also be escaped, owing to multiple synergetic mutations on their epitopes. In total, over 85% of the tested neutralizing antibodies were escaped by Omicron. With regard to neutralizing-antibody-based drugs, the neutralization potency of LY-CoV016, LY-CoV555, REGN10933, REGN10987, AZD1061, AZD8895 and BRII-196 was greatly undermined by Omicron, whereas VIR-7831 and DXP-604 still functioned at a reduced efficacy. Together, our data suggest that infection with Omicron would result in considerable humoral immune evasion, and that neutralizing antibodies targeting the sarbecovirus conserved region will remain most effective. Our results inform the development of antibody-based drugs and vaccines against Omicron and future variants."], ["Oxygen reduction reaction promoted by manganese porphyrins", "The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is catalyzed by manganese(II) porphyrins in the presence of Br\u00f8nsted acids (HAs). Analyses of the catalytic cyclic voltammetric profiles have permitted the ORR mechanism to be constructed and rate constants to be extracted for both the formation of the initial oxygen adduct and the O\u2013O bond cleavage event for a series of HAs. The dependence of the formation rate constant of the oxygen adduct on reactant concentrations reveals a rate law that is first order in Mn porphyrin and oxygen substrate. A second order dependence in HA is observed for unadorned Mn porphyrin platforms whereas with Mn hangman porphyrin, a proton is provided intramolecular to the oxygen adduct and consequently the HA order is reduced to unity. The stabilization of the oxygen adduct with an additional hydrogen bond from HA engenders a rate-determining step involving O\u2013O bond cleavage, resulting in the rare instance where the activation of the O\u2013O bond is directly observed."], ["CALHM1 ion channel mediates purinergic neurotransmission of sweet, bitter and umami tastes", "Recognition of sweet, bitter and umami tastes requires the non-vesicular release from taste bud cells of ATP, which acts as a neurotransmitter to activate afferent neural gustatory pathways(1). However, how ATP is released to fulfil this function is not fully understood. Here we show that calcium homeostasis modulator 1 (CALHM1), a voltage-gated ion channel(2,3), is indispensable for taste-stimuli-evoked ATP release from sweet-, bitter- and umami-sensing taste bud cells. Calhm1 knockout mice have severely impaired perceptions of sweet, bitter and umami compounds, whereas their recognition of sour and salty tastes remains mostly normal. Calhm1 deficiency affects taste perception without interfering with taste cell development or integrity. CALHM1 is expressed specifically in sweet/bitter/umami-sensing type II taste bud cells. Its heterologous expression induces a novel ATP permeability that releases ATP from cells in response to manipulations that activate the CALHM1 ion channel. Knockout of Calhm1 strongly reduces voltage-gated currents in type II cells and taste-evoked ATP release from taste buds without affecting the excitability of taste cells by taste stimuli. Thus, CALHM1 is a voltage-gated ATP-release channel required for sweet, bitter and umami taste perception."], ["A comprehensive quantification of global nitrous oxide sources and sinks", "Bottom-up and top-down approaches are used to quantify global nitrous oxide sources and sinks resulting from both natural and anthropogenic sources, revealing a 30% increase in global human-induced emissions between 1980 and 2016. Nitrous oxide (N2O), like carbon dioxide, is a long-lived greenhouse gas that accumulates in the atmosphere. Over the past 150 years, increasing atmospheric N2O concentrations have contributed to stratospheric ozone depletion(1)and climate change(2), with the current rate of increase estimated at 2 per cent per decade. Existing national inventories do not provide a full picture of N2O emissions, owing to their omission of natural sources and limitations in methodology for attributing anthropogenic sources. Here we present a global N2O inventory that incorporates both natural and anthropogenic sources and accounts for the interaction between nitrogen additions and the biochemical processes that control N2O emissions. We use bottom-up (inventory, statistical extrapolation of flux measurements, process-based land and ocean modelling) and top-down (atmospheric inversion) approaches to provide a comprehensive quantification of global N2O sources and sinks resulting from 21 natural and human sectors between 1980 and 2016. Global N2O emissions were 17.0 (minimum-maximum estimates: 12.2-23.5) teragrams of nitrogen per year (bottom-up) and 16.9 (15.9-17.7) teragrams of nitrogen per year (top-down) between 2007 and 2016. Global human-induced emissions, which are dominated by nitrogen additions to croplands, increased by 30% over the past four decades to 7.3 (4.2-11.4) teragrams of nitrogen per year. This increase was mainly responsible for the growth in the atmospheric burden. Our findings point to growing N2O emissions in emerging economies-particularly Brazil, China and India. Analysis of process-based model estimates reveals an emerging N2O-climate feedback resulting from interactions between nitrogen additions and climate change. The recent growth in N2O emissions exceeds some of the highest projected emission scenarios(3,4), underscoring the urgency to mitigate N2O emissions."], ["Colossal cages in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks as selective carbon dioxide reservoirs", "Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks ( ZIFs) are porous crystalline materials with tetrahedral networks that resemble those of zeolites: transition metals ( Zn, Co) replace tetrahedrally coordinated atoms ( for example, Si), and imidazolate links replace oxygen bridges(1). A striking feature of these materials is that the structure adopted by a given ZIF is determined by link - link interactions, rather than by the structure directing agents used in zeolite synthesis(2). As a result, systematic variations of linker substituents have yielded many different ZIFs that exhibit known or predicted zeolite topologies. The materials are chemically and thermally stable, yet have the long- sought- after design flexibility offered by functionalized organic links and a high density of transition metal ions(1-7) . Here we report the synthesis and characterization of two porous ZIFs-ZIF-95 and ZIF-100-with structures of a scale and complexity previously unknown in zeolites(8-10). The materials have complex cages that contain up to 264 vertices, and are constructed from as many as 7,524 atoms. As expected from the adsorption selectivity recently documented for other members of this materials family(3), both ZIFs selectively capture carbon dioxide from several different gas mixtures at room temperature, with ZIF-100 capable of storing 28 litres per litre of material at standard temperature and pressure. These characteristics, combined with their high thermal and chemical stability and ease of fabrication, make ZIFs promising candidate materials for strategies aimed at ameliorating increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels."], ["RNA-guided genetic silencing systems in bacteria and archaea", "Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) are essential components of nucleic-acid-based adaptive immune systems that are widespread in bacteria and archaea. Similar to RNA interference (RNAi) pathways in eukaryotes, CRISPR-mediated immune systems rely on small RNAs for sequence-specific detection and silencing of foreign nucleic acids, including viruses and plasmids. However, the mechanism of RNA-based bacterial immunity is distinct from RNAi. Understanding how small RNAs are used to find and destroy foreign nucleic acids will provide new insights into the diverse mechanisms of RNA-controlled genetic silencing systems."], ["Enhancing crystal growth using polyelectrolyte solutions and shear flow", "The ability to grow properly sized and good quality crystals is one of the cornerstones of single-crystal diffraction, is advantageous in many industrial-scale chemical processes(1-3), and is important for obtaining institutional approvals of new drugs for which high-quality crystallographic data are required(4-7). Typically, single crystals suitable for such processes and analyses are grown for hours to days during which any mechanical disturbances-believed to be detrimental to the process-are carefully avoided. In particular, stirring and shear flows are known to cause secondary nucleation, which decreases the final size of the crystals (though shear can also increase their quantity(8-14)). Here we demonstrate that in the presence of polymers (preferably, polyionic liquids), crystals of various types grow in common solvents, at constant temperature, much bigger and much faster when stirred, rather than kept still. This conclusion is based on the study of approximately 20 diverse organic molecules, inorganic salts, metal-organic complexes, and even some proteins. On typical timescales of a few to tens of minutes, these molecules grow into regularly faceted crystals that are always larger (with longest linear dimension about 16 times larger) than those obtained in control experiments of the same duration but without stirring or without polymers. We attribute this enhancement to two synergistic effects. First, under shear, the polymers and their aggregates disentangle, compete for solvent molecules and thus effectively 'salt out' (that is, induce precipitation by decreasing solubility of) the crystallizing species. Second, the local shear rate is dependent on particle size, ultimately promoting the growth of larger crystals (but not via surface-energy effects as in classical Ostwald ripening). This closed-system, constant-temperature crystallization driven by shear could be a valuable addition to the repertoire of crystal growth techniques, enabling accelerated growth of crystals required by the materials and pharmaceutical industries."], ["Digital Protocol for Chemical Analysis at Ultralow Concentrations by Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering", "Single molecule surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SM-SERS) has the potential to revolutionize quantitative analysis at ultralow concentrations (less than 1 nM). However, there are no established protocols to generalize the application of this technique in analytical chemistry. Here, a protocol for quantification at ultralow concentrations using SM-SERS is proposed. The approach aims to take advantage of the stochastic nature of the single-molecule regime to achieved lower limits of quantification (LOQ). Two emerging contaminants commonly found in aquatic environments, enrofloxacin (ENRO) and ciprofloxacin (CIPRO), were chosen as nonresonant molecular probes. The methodology involves a multivariate resolution curve fitting known as non-negative matrix factorization with alternating least-squares algorithm (NMF-ALS) to solve spectral overlaps. The key element of the quantification is to realize that, under SM-SERS conditions, the Raman intensity generated by a molecule adsorbed on a \u201chotspot\u201d can be digitalized. Therefore, the number of SERS event counts (rather than SERS intensities) was shown to be proportional to the solution concentration. This allowed the determination of both ENRO and CIPRO with high accuracy and precision even at ultralow concentrations regime. The LOQ for both ENRO and CIPRO were achieved at 2.8 pM. The digital SERS protocol, suggested here, is a roadmap for the implementation of SM-SERS as a routine tool for quantification at ultralow concentrations."], ["Electron ptychography of 2D materials to deep sub-angstrom resolution", "Aberration-corrected optics have made electron microscopy at atomic resolution a widespread and often essential tool for characterizing nanoscale structures. Image resolution has traditionally been improved by increasing the numerical aperture of the lens (alpha) and the beam energy, with the state-of-the-art at 300 kiloelectronvolts just entering the deep sub-angstrom (that is, less than 0.5 angstrom) regime. Two-dimensional (2D) materials are imaged at lower beam energies to avoid displacement damage from large momenta transfers, limiting spatial resolution to about 1 angstrom. Here, by combining an electron microscope pixel-array detector with the dynamic range necessary to record the complete distribution of transmitted electrons and full-field ptychography to recover phase information from the full phase space, we increase the spatial resolution well beyond the traditional numerical-aperture-limited resolution. At a beam energy of 80 kiloelectronvolts, our ptychographic reconstruction improves the image contrast of single-atom defects in MoS2 substantially, reaching an information limit close to 5 alpha, which corresponds to an Abbe diffraction-limited resolution of 0.39 angstrom, at the electron dose and imaging conditions for which conventional imaging methods reach only 0.98 angstrom."], ["Prediction of Bond Dissociation Energy for Organic Molecules Based on a Machine-Learning Approach", "Bond dissociation energy (BDE), which refers to the enthalpy change for the homolysis of a specific covalent bond, is one of the basic thermodynamic properties of molecules. It is very important for understanding chemical reactivities, chemical properties and chemical transformations.

In comparison, exciton-polaritons in strongly coupled quantum well microcavities(5) can undergo stimulated scattering that promises more energy-efficient generation of coherent light by 'polariton lasers'(3,6). Polariton laser operation has been demonstrated in optically pumped semiconductor microcavities at temperatures up to room temperature(7-12), and such lasers can outperform their weak-coupling counterparts in that they have a lower threshold density(12,13). Even though polariton diodes have been realized(14-16), electrically pumped polariton laser operation, which is essential for practical applications, has not been achieved until now. Here we present an electrically pumped polariton laser based on a microcavity containing multiple quantum wells. To prove polariton laser emission unambiguously, we apply a magnetic field and probe the hybrid light-matter nature of the polaritons. Our results represent an important step towards the practical implementation of polaritonic light sources and electrically injected condensates, and can be extended to room-temperature operation using wide-bandgap materials."], ["Chronic active B-cell-receptor signalling in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma", "A role for B-cell-receptor (BCR) signalling in lymphomagenesis has been inferred by studying immunoglobulin genes in human lymphomas(1,2) and by engineering mouse models(3), but genetic and functional evidence for its oncogenic role in human lymphomas is needed. Here we describe a form of 'chronic active' BCR signalling that is required for cell survival in the activated B-cell-like (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The signalling adaptor CARD11 is required for constitutive NF-kappa B pathway activity and survival in ABC DLBCL4. Roughly 10% of ABC DLBCLs have mutant CARD11 isoforms that activate NF-kappa B-5, but the mechanism that engages wild-type CARD11 in other ABC DLBCLs was unknown. An RNA interference genetic screen revealed that a BCR signalling component, Bruton's tyrosine kinase, is essential for the survival of ABC DLBCLs with wild-type CARD11. In addition, knockdown of proximal BCR subunits (IgM, Ig-kappa, CD79A and CD79B) killed ABC DLBCLs with wildtype CARD11 but not other lymphomas. The BCRs in these ABC DLBCLs formed prominent clusters in the plasma membrane with low diffusion, similarly to BCRs in antigen-stimulated normal B cells. Somatic mutations affecting the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) signalling modules(6) of CD79B and CD79A were detected frequently in ABC DLBCL biopsy samples but rarely in other DLBCLs and never in Burkitt's lymphoma or mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. In 18% of ABC DLBCLs, one functionally critical residue of CD79B, the first ITAM tyrosine, was mutated. These mutations increased surface BCR expression and attenuated Lyn kinase, a feedback inhibitor of BCR signalling. These findings establish chronic active BCR signalling as a new pathogenetic mechanism in ABC DLBCL, suggesting several therapeutic strategies."], ["Efficient, stable and scalable perovskite solar cells using poly(3-hexylthiophene)", "Perovskite solar cells typically comprise electron-and hole-transport materials deposited on each side of a perovskite active layer. So far, only two organic hole-transport materials have led to state-of-the-art performance in these solar cells(1): poly(triarylamine) (PTAA)(2-5) and 2,2',7,7'-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9'-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD)(6,7). However, these materials have several drawbacks in terms of commercialization, including high cost(8), the need for hygroscopic dopants that trigger degradation of the perovskite layer(9) and limitations in their deposition processes(10). Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is an alternative hole-transport material with excellent optoelectronic properties(11-13), low cost(8,14) and ease of fabrication(15-18), but so far the efficiencies of perovskite solar cells using P3HT have reached only around 16 per cent(19). Here we propose a device architecture for highly efficient perovskite solar cells that use P3HT as a hole-transport material without any dopants. A thin layer of wide-bandgap halide perovskite is formed on top of the narrow-bandgap light-absorbing layer by an in situ reaction of n-hexyl trimethyl ammonium bromide on the perovskite surface. Our device has a certified power conversion efficiency of 22.7 per cent with hysteresis of +/- 0.51 per cent; exhibits good stability at 85 per cent relative humidity without encapsulation; and upon encapsulation demonstrates long-term operational stability for 1,370 hours under 1-Sun illumination at room temperature, maintaining 95 per cent of the initial efficiency. We extend our platform to large-area modules (24.97 square centimetres)-which are fabricated using a scalable bar-coating method for the deposition of P3HT-and achieve a power conversion efficiency of 16.0 per cent. Realizing the potential of P3HT as a hole-transport material by using a wide-bandgap halide could be a valuable direction for perovskite solar-cell research."], ["The effect of illumination on the formation of metal halide perovskite films", "Optimizing the morphology of metal halide perovskite films is an important way to improve the performance of solar cells(1) when these materials are used as light harvesters(2), because film homogeneity is correlated with photovoltaic performance(3). Many device architectures and processing techniques have been explored with the aim of achieving high-performance devices(4), including single-step deposition(5), sequential deposition(6,7) and anti-solvent methods(1,8). Earlier studies have looked at the influence of reaction conditions on film quality(3), such as the concentration of the reactants9,10 and the reaction temperature(11). However, the precise mechanism of the reaction and the main factors that govern it are poorly understood. The consequent lack of control is the main reason for the large variability observed in perovskite morphology and the related solar-cell performance(2,3). Here we show that light has a strong influence on the rate of perovskite formation and on film morphology in both of the main deposition methods currently used: sequential deposition and the anti-solvent method. We study the reaction of a metal halide (lead iodide) with an organic compound (methylammonium iodide) using confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The lead iodide crystallizes before the intercalation of methylammonium iodide commences, producing the methylammonium lead iodide perovskite. We find that the formation of perovskite via such a sequential deposition is much accelerated by light. The influence of light on morphology is reflected in a doubling of solar-cell efficiency. Conversely, using the anti-solvent method to form methyl ammonium lead iodide perovskite in a single step from the same starting materials, we find that the best photovoltaic performance is obtained when films are produced in the dark. The discovery of light-activated crystallization not only identifies a previously unknown source of variability in opto-electronic properties, but also opens up new ways of tuning morphology and structuring perovskites for various applications."], ["Structures of the \u03c3<sub>2</sub>, receptor enable docking for bioactive ligand discovery", "The sigma(2 )receptor has attracted intense interest in cancer imaging(1), psychiatric disease(2), neuropathic pain(3-5) and other areas of biology(6,7). Here we determined the crystal structure of this receptor in complex with the clinical candidate roluperidone(2) and the tool compound PB28(8). These structures templated a large-scale docking screen of 490 million virtual molecules, of which 484 compounds were synthesized and tested. We identified 127 new chemotypes with affinities superior to 1 mu M, 31 of which had affinities superior to 50 nM. The hit rate fell smoothly and monotonically with docking score. We optimized three hits for potency and selectivity, and achieved affinities that ranged from 3 to 48 nM, with up to 250-fold selectivity versus the sigma(1) receptor. Crystal structures of two ligands bound to the sigma(2) receptor confirmed the docked poses. To investigate the contribution of the sigma(2) receptor in pain, two potent sigma(2)-selective ligands and one potent sigma(1)/sigma(2) non-selective ligand were tested for efficacy in a mouse model of neuropathic pain. All three ligands showed time-dependent decreases in mechanical hypersensitivity in the spared nerve injury model(9), suggesting that the sigma(2) receptor has a role in nociception.

According to one version of the 'RNA world' hypothesis(1-3) this polymer was RNA, but attempts to provide experimental support for this have failed(4,5). In particular, although there has been some success demonstrating that 'activated' ribonucleotides can polymerize to form RNA(6,7), it is far from obvious how such ribonucleotides could have formed from their constituent parts ( ribose and nucleobases). Ribose is difficult to form selectively(8,9), and the addition of nucleobases to ribose is inefficient in the case of purines(10) and does not occur at all in the case of the canonical pyrimidines(11). Here we show that activated pyrimidine ribonucleotides can be formed in a short sequence that bypasses free ribose and the nucleobases, and instead proceeds through arabinose amino-oxazoline and anhydronucleoside intermediates. The starting materials for the synthesis-cyanamide, cyanoacetylene, glycolaldehyde, glyceraldehyde and inorganic phosphate-are plausible prebiotic feedstock molecules(12-15), and the conditions of the synthesis are consistent with potential early-Earth geochemical models. Although inorganic phosphate is only incorporated into the nucleotides at a late stage of the sequence, its presence from the start is essential as it controls three reactions in the earlier stages by acting as a general acid/base catalyst, a nucleophilic catalyst, a pH buffer and a chemical buffer. For prebiotic reaction sequences, our results highlight the importance of working with mixed chemical systems in which reactants for a particular reaction step can also control other steps."], ["Cleavable comonomers enable degradable, recyclable thermoset plastics", "Thermosets\u2014polymeric materials that adopt a permanent shape upon curing\u2014have a key role in the modern plastics and rubber industries, comprising about 20 per cent of polymeric materials manufactured today, with a worldwide annual production of about 65 million tons1,2. The high density of crosslinks that gives thermosets their useful properties (for example, chemical and thermal resistance and tensile strength) comes at the expense of degradability and recyclability. Here, using the industrial thermoset polydicyclopentadiene as a model system, we show that when a small number of cleavable bonds are selectively installed within the strands of thermosets using a comonomer additive in otherwise traditional curing workflows, the resulting materials can display the same mechanical properties as the native material, but they can undergo triggered, mild degradation to yield soluble, recyclable products of controlled size and functionality. By contrast, installation of cleavable crosslinks, even at much higher loadings, does not produce degradable materials. These findings reveal that optimization of the cleavable bond location can be used as a design principle to achieve controlled thermoset degradation. Moreover, we introduce a class of recyclable thermosets poised for rapid deployment."], ["PHASE-CONTRAST IMAGING OF WEAKLY ABSORBING MATERIALS USING HARD X-RAYS", "IMAGING with hard X-rays is an important diagnostic tool in medicine, biology and materials science. Contact radiography and tomography using hard X-rays provide information on internal structures that cannot be obtained using other non-destructive methods. The image contrast results from variations in the Xray absorption arising from density differences and variations in composition and thickness of the object. But although X-rays penetrate deeply into carbon-based compounds, such as soft biological tissue, polymers and carbon-fibre composites, there is little absorption and therefore poor image contrast. Here we describe a method for enhancing the contrast in hard X-ray images of weakly absorbing materials by resolving phase variations across the Xray beam(1-4). The phase gradients are detected using diffraction from perfect silicon crystals. The diffraction properties of the crystal determine the ultimate spatial resolution in the image; we can readily obtain a resolution of a fraction of a millimetre. Our method shows dramatic contrast enhancement for weakly absorbing biological and inorganic materials, compared with conventional radiography using the same X-ray energy. We present both bright-field and dark-field phase-contrast images, and show evidence of contrast reversal. The method should have the clinical advantage of good contrast for low absorbed X-ray dose."], ["Conical intersection dynamics of the primary photoisomerization event in vision", "Ever since the conversion of the 11-cis retinal chromophore to its all-trans form in rhodopsin was identified as the primary photochemical event in vision(1), experimentalists and theoreticians have tried to unravel the molecular details of this process. The high quantum yield of 0.65 (ref. 2), the production of the primary ground-state rhodopsin photoproduct within a mere 200 fs (refs 3-7), and the storage of considerable energy in the first stable bathorhodopsin intermediate(8) all suggest an unusually fast and efficient photoactivated one-way reaction(9). Rhodopsin's unique reactivity is generally attributed to a conical intersection between the potential energy surfaces of the ground and excited electronic states(10,11) enabling the efficient and ultrafast conversion of photon energy into chemical energy(12-16). But obtaining direct experimental evidence for the involvement of a conical intersection is challenging: the energy gap between the electronic states of the reacting molecule changes significantly over an ultrashort time-scale, which calls for observational methods that combine high temporal resolution with a broad spectral observation window. Here we show that ultrafast optical spectroscopy with sub-20-fs time resolution and spectral coverage from the visible to the near-infrared allows us to follow the dynamics leading to the conical intersection in rhodopsin isomerization. We track coherent wave-packet motion from the photoexcited Franck-Condon region to the photoproduct by monitoring the loss of reactant emission and the subsequent appearance of photoproduct absorption, and find excellent agreement between the experimental observations and molecular dynamics calculations that involve a true electronic state crossing. Taken together, these findings constitute the most compelling evidence to date for the existence and importance of conical intersections in visual photochemistry."], ["Crystal structure and mechanism of a bacterial fluorinating enzyme", "Fluorine is the thirteenth most abundant element in the earth's crust, but fluoride concentrations in surface water are low and fluorinated metabolites are extremely rare(1,2). The fluoride ion is a potent nucleophile in its desolvated state, but is tightly hydrated in water and effectively inert. Low availability and a lack of chemical reactivity have largely excluded fluoride from biochemistry: in particular, fluorine's high redox potential precludes the haloperoxidase-type mechanism(3,4) used in the metabolic incorporation of chloride and bromide ions. But fluorinated chemicals are growing in industrial importance, with applications in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and materials products(5-7). Reactive fluorination reagents requiring specialist process technologies are needed in industry and, although biological catalysts for these processes are highly sought after, only one enzyme that can convert fluoride to organic fluorine has been described(8). Streptomyces cattleya can form carbon-fluorine bonds(9) and must therefore have evolved an enzyme able to overcome the chemical challenges of using aqueous fluoride. Here we report the sequence and three-dimensional structure of the first native fluorination enzyme, 5'-fluoro-5'-deoxyadenosine synthase, from this organism. Both substrate and products have been observed bound to the enzyme, enabling us to propose a nucleophilic substitution mechanism for this biological fluorination reaction."], ["Nodal-chain metals", "The band theory of solids is arguably the most successful theory of condensed-matter physics, providing a description of the electronic energy levels in various materials. Electronic wavefunctions obtained from the band theory enable a topological characterization of metals for which the electronic spectrum may host robust, topologically protected, fermionic quasiparticles. Many of these quasiparticles are analogues of the elementary particles of the Standard Model(1-10), but others do not have a counterpart in relativistic high-energy theories(11-18). A complete list of possible quasiparticles in solids is lacking, even in the non-interacting case. Here we describe the possible existence of a hitherto unrecognized type of fermionic excitation in metals. This excitation forms a nodal chain-a chain of connected loops in momentum space-along which conduction and valence bands touch. We prove that the nodal chain is topologically distinct from previously reported excitations. We discuss the symmetry requirements for the appearance of this excitation and predict that it is realized in an existing material, iridium tetrafluoride (IrF4), as well as in other compounds of this class of materials. Using IrF4 as an example, we provide a discussion of the topological surface states associated with the nodal chain. We argue that the presence of the nodal-chain fermions will result in anomalous magnetotransport properties, distinct from those of materials exhibiting previously known excitations."], ["Partially oxidized atomic cobalt layers for carbon dioxide electroreduction to liquid fuel", "Electroreduction of CO2 into useful fuels, especially if driven by renewable energy, represents a potentially 'clean' strategy for replacing fossil feedstocks and dealing with increasing CO2 emissions and their adverse effects on climate(1-4). The critical bottleneck lies in activating CO2 into the CO2-radical anion or other intermediates that can be converted further, as the activation usually requires impractically high overpotentials. Recently, electrocatalysts based on oxide-derived metal nanostructures have been shown(5-8) to enable CO2 reduction at low overpotentials. However, it remains unclear how the electrocatalytic activity of these metals is influenced by their native oxides, mainly because microstructural features such as interfaces and defects(9) influence CO2 reduction activity yet are difficult to control. To evaluate the role of the two different catalytic sites, here we fabricate two kinds of four-atom-thick layers: pure cobalt metal, and co-existing domains of cobalt metal and cobalt oxide. Cobalt mainly produces formate (HCOO-) during CO2 electroreduction; we find that surface cobalt atoms of the atomically thin layers have higher intrinsic activity and selectivity towards formate production, at lower overpotentials, than do surface cobalt atoms on bulk samples. Partial oxidation of the atomic layers further increases their intrinsic activity, allowing us to realize stable current densities of about 10 milliamperes per square centimetre over 40 hours, with approximately 90 per cent formate selectivity at an overpotential of only 0.24 volts, which outperforms previously reported metal or metal oxide electrodes evaluated under comparable conditions(1,2,6,7,10). The correct morphology and oxidation state can thus transform a material from one considered nearly non-catalytic for the CO2 electroreduction reaction into an active catalyst. These findings point to new opportunities for manipulating and improving the CO2 electroreduction properties of metal systems, especially once the influence of both the atomic-scale structure and the presence of oxide are mechanistically better understood."], ["Wetting regulates autophagy of phase-separated compartments and the cytosol", "Compartmentalization of cellular material in droplet-like structures is a hallmark of liquid-liquid phase separation(1,2), but the mechanisms of droplet removal are poorly understood. Evidence suggests that droplets can be degraded by autophagy(3,4), a highly conserved degradation system in which membrane sheets bend to isolate portions of the cytoplasm within double-membrane autophagosomes(5-7). Here we examine how autophagosomes sequester droplets that contain the protein p62 (also known as SQSTM1) in living cells, and demonstrate that double-membrane, autophagosome-like vesicles form at the surface of protein-free droplets in vitro through partial wetting. A minimal physical model shows that droplet surface tension supports the formation of membrane sheets. The model also predicts that bending sheets either divide droplets for piecemeal sequestration or sequester entire droplets. We find that autophagosomal sequestration is robust to variations in the droplet-sheet adhesion strength. However, the two sides of partially wetted sheets are exposed to different environments, which can determine the bending direction of autophagosomal sheets. Our discovery of this interplay between the material properties of droplets and membrane sheets enables us to elucidate the mechanisms that underpin droplet autophagy, or 'fluidophagy'. Furthermore, we uncover a switching mechanism that allows droplets to act as liquid assembly platforms for cytosol-degrading autophagosomes(8) or as specific autophagy substrates(9-11). We propose that droplet-mediated autophagy represents a previously undescribed class of processes that are driven by elastocapillarity, highlighting the importance of wetting in cytosolic organization."], ["Deep physical neural networks trained with backpropagation", "Deep-learning models have become pervasive tools in science and engineering. However, their energy requirements now increasingly limit their scalability(1). Deep-learning accelerators(2-9) aim to perform deep learning energy-efficiently, usually targeting the inference phase and often by exploiting physical substrates beyond conventional electronics. Approaches so far(10-22) have been unable to apply the backpropagation algorithm to train unconventional novel hardware in situ. The advantages of backpropagation have made it the de facto training method for large-scale neural networks, so this deficiency constitutes a major impediment. Here we introduce a hybrid in situ-in silico algorithm, called physics-aware training, that applies backpropagation to train controllable physical systems. Just as deep learning realizes computations with deep neural networks made from layers of mathematical functions, our approach allows us to train deep physical neural networks made from layers of controllable physical systems, even when the physical layers lack any mathematical isomorphism to conventional artificial neural network layers. To demonstrate the universality of our approach, we train diverse physical neural networks based on optics, mechanics and electronics to experimentally perform audio and image classification tasks. Physics-aware training combines the scalability of backpropagation with the automatic mitigation of imperfections and noise achievable with in situ algorithms. Physical neural networks have the potential to perform machine learning faster and more energy-efficiently than conventional electronic processors and, more broadly, can endow physical systems with automatically designed physical functionalities, for example, for robotics(23-26), materials(27-29) and smart sensors(30-32)."], ["CO2 electrolysis to multicarbon products in strong acid", "Carbon dioxide electroreduction (CO2R) is being actively studied as a promising route to convert carbon emissions to valuable chemicals and fuels. However, the fraction of input CO2 that is productively reduced has typically been very low, <2% for multicarbon products; the balance reacts with hydroxide to form carbonate in both alkaline and neutral reactors. Acidic electrolytes would overcome this limitation, but hydrogen evolution has hitherto dominated under those conditions. We report that concentrating potassium cations in the vicinity of electrochemically active sites accelerates CO2 activation to enable efficient CO2R in acid. We achieve CO2R on copper at pH <1 with a single-pass CO2 utilization of 77%, including a conversion efficiency of 50% toward multicarbon products (ethylene, ethanol, and 1-propanol) at a current density of 1.2 amperes per square centimeter and a full-cell voltage of 4.2 volts."], ["Optical-field-induced current in dielectrics", "The time it takes to switch on and off electric current determines the rate at which signals can be processed and sampled in modern information technology(1-4). Field-effect transistors(1-3,5,6) are able to control currents at frequencies of the order of or higher than 100 gigahertz, but electric interconnects may hamper progress towards reaching the terahertz (10(12) hertz) range. All-optical injection of currents through interfering photoexcitation pathways(7-10) or photoconductive switching of terahertz transients(11-16) has made it possible to control electric current on a subpicosecond time-scale in semiconductors. Insulators have been deemed unsuitable for both methods, because of the need for either ultraviolet light or strong fields, which induce slow damage or ultrafast break-down(17-20), respectively. Here we report the feasibility of electric signal manipulation in a dielectric. A few-cycle optical waveform reversibly increases-free from breakdown-the a.c. conductivity of amorphous silicon dioxide (fused silica) by more than 18 orders of magnitude within 1 femtosecond, allowing electric currents to be driven, directed and switched by the instantaneous light field.

The identification of the enzyme as a unique cysteine protease and the design of potent peptide aldehyde inhibitors are described. Purification and cloning of the complementary DNA indicates that IL-1-beta-converting enzyme is composed of two nonidentical subunits that are derived from a single proenzyme, possibly by autoproteolysis. Selective inhibition of the enzyme in human blood monocytes blocks production of mature IL-1-beta, indicating that it is a potential therapeutic target."], ["Laser picoscopy of valence electrons in solids", "Laser-generated high-harmonic emission is used to image the valence potential and electron density in magnesium fluoride and calcium fluoride at the picometre scale, enabling direct probing of material properties. Valence electrons contribute a small fraction of the total electron density of materials, but they determine their essential chemical, electronic and optical properties. Strong laser fields can probe electrons in valence orbitals(1-3)and their dynamics(4-6)in the gas phase. Previous laser studies of solids have associated high-harmonic emission(7-12)with the spatial arrangement of atoms in the crystal lattice(13,14)and have used terahertz fields to probe interatomic potential forces(15). Yet the direct, picometre-scale imaging of valence electrons in solids has remained challenging. Here we show that intense optical fields interacting with crystalline solids could enable the imaging of valence electrons at the picometre scale. An intense laser field with a strength that is comparable to the fields keeping the valence electrons bound in crystals can induce quasi-free electron motion. The harmonics of the laser field emerging from the nonlinear scattering of the valence electrons by the crystal potential contain the critical information that enables picometre-scale, real-space mapping of the valence electron structure. We used high harmonics to reconstruct images of the valence potential and electron density in crystalline magnesium fluoride and calcium fluoride with a spatial resolution of about 26 picometres. Picometre-scale imaging of valence electrons could enable direct probing of the chemical, electronic, optical and topological properties of materials."], ["X-ray structure of the mouse serotonin 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor", "Neurotransmitter-gated ion channels of the Cys-loop receptor family mediate fast neurotransmission throughout the nervous system. The molecular processes of neurotransmitter binding, subsequent opening of the ion channel and ion permeation remain poorly understood. Here we present the X-ray structure of a mammalian Cys-loop receptor, the mouse serotonin 5-HT3 receptor, at 3.5 angstrom resolution. The structure of the proteolysed receptor, made up of two fragments and comprising part of the intracellular domain, was determined in complex with stabilizing nanobodies. The extracellular domain reveals the detailed anatomy of the neurotransmitter binding site capped by a nanobody. The membrane domain delimits an aqueous pore with a 4.6 angstrom constriction. In the intracellular domain, a bundle of five intracellular helices creates a closed vestibule where lateral portals are obstructed by loops. This 5-HT3 receptor structure, revealing part of the intracellular domain, expands the structural basis for understanding the operating mechanism of mammalian Cys-loop receptors."], ["Thickness - independent capacitance of vertically aligned liquid-crystalline MXenes", "The scalable and sustainable manufacture of thick electrode films with high energy and power densities is critical for the large-scale storage of electrochemical energy for application in transportation and stationary electric grids. Two-dimensional nanomaterials have become the predominant choice of electrode material in the pursuit of high energy and power densities owing to their large surface area-to-volume ratios and lack of solid-state diffusion(1,2). However, traditional electrode fabrication methods often lead to restacking of two-dimensional nanomaterials, which limits ion transport in thick films and results in systems in which the electrochemical performance is highly dependent on the thickness of the film(1-4). Strategies for facilitating ion transport such as increasing the interlayer spacing by intercalation(5-8) or introducing film porosity by designing nanoarchitectures(9,10)-result in materials with low volumetric energy storage as well as complex and lengthy ion transport paths that impede performance at high charge-discharge rates. Vertical alignment of two-dimensional flakes enables directional ion transport that can lead to thickness-independent electrochemical performances in thick films(11-13). However, so far only limited success(11,12) has been reported, and the mitigation of performance losses remains a major challenge when working with films of two-dimensional nanomaterials with thicknesses that are near to or exceed the industrial standard of 100 micrometres. Here we demonstrate electrochemical energy storage that is independent of film thickness for vertically aligned two-dimensional titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx), a material from the MXene family (two dimensional carbides and nitrides of transition metals (M), where X stands for carbon or nitrogen). The vertical alignment was achieved by mechanical shearing of a discotic lamellar liquid-crystal phase of Ti3C2Tx. The resulting electrode films show excellent performance that is nearly independent of film thickness up to 200 micrometres, which makes them highly attractive for energy storage applications. Furthermore, the self-assembly approach presented here is scalable and can be extended to other systems that involve directional transport, such as catalysis and filtration."], ["Lubrication by charged polymers", "Long-ranged forces between surfaces in a liquid control effects from colloid stability(1) to biolubrication(2), and can be modified either by steric factors due to flexible polymers(3), or by surface charge effects(4). In particular, neutral polymer 'brushes' may lead to a massive reduction in sliding friction between the surfaces to which they are attached(5-7), whereas hydrated ions can act as extremely efficient lubricants between sliding charged surfaces(8). Here we show that brushes of charged polymers (polyelectrolytes) attached to surfaces rubbing across an aqueous medium result in superior lubrication compared to other polymeric surfactants. Effective friction coefficients with polyelectrolyte brushes in water are lower than about 0.0006-0.001 even at low sliding velocities and at pressures of up to several atmospheres (typical of those in living systems). We attribute this to the exceptional resistance to mutual interpenetration displayed by the compressed, counterion-swollen brushes, together with the fluidity of the hydration layers surrounding the charged, rubbing polymer segments. Our findings may have implications for biolubrication effects, which are important in the design of lubricated surfaces in artificial implants, and in understanding frictional processes in biological systems."], ["An atlas of substrate specificities for the human serine/threonine kinome", "Protein phosphorylation is one of the most widespread post-translational modifications in biology(1,2). With advances in mass-spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics, 90,000 sites of serine and threonine phosphorylation have so far been identified, and several thousand have been associated with human diseases and biological processes(3,4). For the vast majority of phosphorylation events, it is not yet known which of the more than 300 protein serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) kinases encoded in the human genome are responsible(3). Here we used synthetic peptide libraries to profile the substrate sequence specificity of 303 Ser/Thr kinases, comprising more than 84% of those predicted to be active in humans. Viewed in its entirety, the substrate specificity of the kinome was substantially more diverse than expected and was driven extensively by negative selectivity. We used our kinome-wide dataset to computationally annotate and identify the kinases capable of phosphorylating every reported phosphorylation site in the human Ser/Thr phosphoproteome. For the small minority of phosphosites for which the putative protein kinases involved have been previously reported, our predictions were in excellent agreement. When this approach was applied to examine the signalling response of tissues and cell lines to hormones, growth factors, targeted inhibitors and environmental or genetic perturbations, it revealed unexpected insights into pathway complexity and compensation. Overall, these studies reveal the intrinsic substrate specificity of the human Ser/Thr kinome, illuminate cellular signalling responses and provide a resource to link phosphorylation events to biological pathways."], ["Metal-free visible light photoredox enables generation of carbyne equivalents via phosphonium ylide C\u2013H activation", "Carbyne, an interesting synthetic intermediate, has recently been generated from hypervalent iodine precursors via photoredox catalysis. Given the underexplored chemistry of carbyne, due to the paucity of carbyne sources, we are intrigued to discover a new source for this reactive species from classical reagents \u2013 phosphonium ylides.

Here, to address this challenge, we developed a living material assembly process based on the capture and on-site processing of spatially segregated bacterial colonies within individual coacervate microdroplets for the endogenous construction of membrane-bounded, molecularly crowded, and compositionally, structurally and morphologically complex synthetic cells. The bacteriogenic protocells inherit diverse biological components, exhibit multifunctional cytomimetic properties and can be endogenously remodelled to include a spatially partitioned DNA-histone nucleus-like condensate, membranized water vacuoles and a three-dimensional network of F-actin proto-cytoskeletal filaments. The ensemble is biochemically energized by ATP production derived from implanted live Escherichia coli cells to produce a cellular bionic system with amoeba-like external morphology and integrated life-like properties. Our results demonstrate a bacteriogenic strategy for the bottom-up construction of functional protoliving microdevices and provide opportunities for the fabrication of new synthetic cell modules and augmented living/synthetic cell constructs with potential applications in engineered synthetic biology and biotechnology."], ["Anaerobic oxidation of short-chain hydrocarbons by marine sulphate-reducing bacteria", "The short-chain hydrocarbons ethane, propane and butane are constituents of natural gas. They are usually assumed to be of thermochemical origin(1), but biological formation of ethane and propane has been also observed(2). Microbial utilization of short-chain hydrocarbons has been shown in some aerobic species(3,4) but not in anaerobic species of bacteria. On the other hand, anaerobic utilization of short-chain hydrocarbons would in principle be expected because various anaerobic bacteria grow with higher homologues (>= C-6)(5). Indeed, chemical analyses of hydrocarbon-rich habitats with limited or no access of oxygen indicated in situ biodegradation of short-chain hydrocarbons(6-10). Here we report the enrichment of sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) with such capacity from marine hydrocarbon seep areas. Propane or n-butane as the sole growth substrate led to sediment-free sulphate-reducing enrichment cultures growing at 12, 28 or 60 degrees C. With ethane, a slower enrichment with residual sediment was obtained at 12 degrees C. Isolation experiments resulted in a mesophilic pure culture (strain BuS5) that used only propane and n-butane (methane, isobutane, alcohols or carboxylic acids did not support growth). Complete hydrocarbon oxidation to CO2 and the preferential oxidation of C-12-enriched alkanes were observed with strain BuS5 and other cultures. Metabolites of propane included iso- and n-propylsuccinate, indicating a subterminal as well as an unprecedented terminal alkane activation with involvement of fumarate. According to 16S ribosomal RNA analyses, strain BuS5 affiliates with Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus, a cluster of widespread marine SRB. An enrichment culture with propane growing at 60 degrees C was dominated by Desulfotomaculum-like SRB. Our results suggest that diverse SRB are able to thrive in seep areas and gas reservoirs on propane and butane, thus altering the gas composition and contributing to sulphide production."], ["The promise of induced pluripotent stem cells in research and therapy", "The field of stem-cell biology has been catapulted forward by the startling development of reprogramming technology. The ability to restore pluripotency to somatic cells through the ectopic co-expression of reprogramming factors has created powerful new opportunities for modelling human diseases and offers hope for personalized regenerative cell therapies. While the field is racing ahead, some researchers are pausing to evaluate whether induced pluripotent stem cells are indeed the true equivalents of embryonic stem cells and whether subtle differences between these types of cell might affect their research applications and therapeutic potential."], ["Two-dimensional ferroelectricity in a single-element bismuth monolayer", "Ferroelectric materials are fascinating for their non-volatile switchable electric polarizations induced by the spontaneous inversion-symmetry breaking. However, in all of the conventional ferroelectric compounds, at least two constituent ions are required to support the polarization switching(1,2). Here, we report the observation of a single-element ferroelectric state in a black phosphorus-like bismuth layer(3), in which the ordered charge transfer and the regular atom distortion between sublattices happen simultaneously. Instead of a homogenous orbital configuration that ordinarily occurs in elementary substances, we found the Bi atoms in a black phosphorous-like Bi monolayer maintain a weak and anisotropic sp orbital hybridization, giving rise to the inversion-symmetry-broken buckled structure accompanied with charge redistribution in the unit cell. As a result, the in-plane electric polarization emerges in the Bi monolayer. Using the in-plane electric field produced by scanning probe microscopy, ferroelectric switching is further visualized experimentally. Owing to the conjugative locking between the charge transfer and atom displacement, we also observe the anomalous electric potential profile at the 180 degrees tail-to-tail domain wall induced by competition between the electronic structure and electric polarization. This emergent single-element ferroelectricity broadens the mechanism of ferroelectrics and may enrich the applications of ferroelectronics in the future."], ["Au-Pd separation enhances bimetallic catalysis of alcohol oxidation", "In oxidation reactions catalysed by supported metal nanoparticles with oxygen as the terminal oxidant, the rate of the oxygen reduction can be a limiting factor. This is exemplified by the oxidative dehydrogenation of alcohols, an important class of reactions with modern commercial applications(1-3). Supported gold nanoparticles are highly active for the dehydrogenation of the alcohol to an aldehyde(4) but are less effective for oxygen reduction(5,6). By contrast, supported palladium nanoparticles offer high efficacy for oxygen reduction5,6. This imbalance can be overcome by alloying gold with palladium, which gives enhanced activity to both reactions(7,8,9); however, the electrochemical potential of the alloy is a compromise between that of the two metals, meaning that although the oxygen reduction can be improved in the alloy, the dehydrogenation activity is often limited. Here we show that by separating the gold and palladium components in bimetallic carbon-supported catalysts, we can almost double the reaction rate compared with that achieved with the corresponding alloy catalyst. We demonstrate this using physical mixtures of carbon-supported monometallic gold and palladium catalysts and a bimetallic catalyst comprising separated gold and palladium regions. Furthermore, we demonstrate electrochemically that this enhancement is attributable to the coupling of separate redox processes occurring at isolated gold and palladium sites. The discovery of this catalytic effect-a cooperative redox enhancement-offers an approach to the design of multicomponent heterogeneous catalysts."], ["TDP-43 and RNA form amyloid-like myo-granules in regenerating muscle", "A dominant histopathological feature in neuromuscular diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and inclusion body myopathy, is cytoplasmic aggregation of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43. Although rare mutations in TARDBP-the gene that encodes TDP-43-that lead to protein misfolding often cause protein aggregation, most patients do not have any mutations in TARDBP. Therefore, aggregates of wild-type TDP-43 arise in most patients by an unknown mechanism. Here we show that TDP-43 is an essential protein for normal skeletal muscle formation that unexpectedly forms cytoplasmic, amyloid-like oligomeric assemblies, which we call myo-granules, during regeneration of skeletal muscle in mice and humans. Myo-granules bind to mRNAs that encode sarcomeric proteins and are cleared as myofibres mature. Although myo-granules occur during normal skeletal-muscle regeneration, myo-granules can seed TDP-43 amyloid fibrils in vitro and are increased in a mouse model of inclusion body myopathy. Therefore, increased assembly or decreased clearance of functionally normal myo-granules could be the source of cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates that commonly occur in neuromuscular disease."], ["Heterogeneous production of nitrous acid on soot in polluted air masses", "Polluted air masses are characterized by high concentrations of oxidized nitrogen compounds which are involved in photochemical smog and ozone formation. The OH radical is a key species in these oxidation processes. The photolysis of nitrous acid (HNO2), in the morning, leads to the direct formation of the OH radical and may therefore contribute significantly to the initiation of the daytime photochemistry in the polluted planetary boundary layer. But the formation of nitrous acid remains poorly understood: experimental studies imply that a suggested heterogeneous formation process involving NO2 is not efficient enough to explain the observed night-time build-up of HNO2 in polluted air masses(1). Here we describe kinetic investigations which indicate that the heterogeneous production of HNO2 from NO2 on suspended soot particles proceeds 10(5) to 10(7) times faster than on previously studied surfaces. We therefore propose that the interaction between NO2 and soot particles may account for the high concentrations of HNO2 in air masses where combustion sources contribute to air pollution by soot and NO2 emissions. We believe that the observed HNO2 formation results from the reduction of NO2 in the presence of water by C-O and C-H groups in the soot. Although prolonged exposure to oxidizing agents in the atmosphere is likely to affect the chemical activity of these groups, our observations nevertheless suggest that fresh soot may have a considerable effect on the chemical reactions occurring in polluted air."], ["Reticular synthesis and the design of new materials", "The long-standing challenge of designing and constructing new crystalline solid-state materials from molecular building blocks is just beginning to be addressed with success.

Yet, because of the inherently fragile nature of the physical computing elements (qubits), achieving quantum advantages over classical computation requires extremely low error rates for qubit operations, as well as substantial physical qubits, to realize fault tolerance via quantum error correction(2,3). However, recent theoretical work(4,5) has shown that the accuracy of computation (based on expectation values of quantum observables) can be enhanced through an extrapolation of results from a collection of experiments of varying noise. Here we demonstrate this error mitigation protocol on a superconducting quantum processor, enhancing its computational capability, with no additional hardware modifications. We apply the protocol to mitigate errors in canonical single-and two-qubit experiments and then extend its application to the variational optimization(6-8) of Hamiltonians for quantum chemistry and magnetism(9). We effectively demonstrate that the suppression of incoherent errors helps to achieve an otherwise inaccessible level of accuracy in the variational solutions using our noisy processor. These results demonstrate that error mitigation techniques will enable substantial improvements in the capabilities of near-term quantum computing hardware."], ["THE NEURAL CORRELATES OF THE VERBAL COMPONENT OF WORKING MEMORY", "BY repeating words 'in our head', verbal material (such as telephone numbers) can be kept in working memory1 almost indefinitely. This 'articulatory loop' includes a subvocal rehearsal system2-6 and a phonological store3,6-10. Little is known about neural correlates of this model of verbal short-term memory. We therefore measured regional cerebral blood flow, an index of neuronal activity, in volunteers performing a task engaging both components of the articulatory loop (short-term memory for letters)5-10 and a task which engages only the subvocal rehearsal system (rhyming judgement for letters)4,11. Stimuli were presented visually and the subjects did not speak. We report here that comparisons of distribution of cerebral blood flow in these conditions localized the phonological store to the left supramarginal gyrus whereas the subvocal rehearsal system was associated with Broca's area. This is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of the normal anatomy of the components of the 'articulatory loop'."], ["Phenotypic landscape of intestinal organoid regeneration", "The development of intestinal organoids from single adult intestinal stem cells in vitro recapitulates the regenerative capacity of the intestinal epithelium(1,2). Here we unravel the mechanisms that orchestrate both organoid formation and the regeneration of intestinal tissue, using an image-based screen to assay an annotated library of compounds. We generate multivariate feature profiles for hundreds of thousands of organoids to quantitatively describe their phenotypic landscape. We then use these phenotypic fingerprints to infer regulatory genetic interactions, establishing a new approach to the mapping of genetic interactions in an emergent system. This allows us to identify genes that regulate cell-fate transitions and maintain the balance between regeneration and homeostasis, unravelling previously unknown roles for several pathways, among them retinoic acid signalling. We then characterize a crucial role for retinoic acid nuclear receptors in controlling exit from the regenerative state and driving enterocyte differentiation. By combining quantitative imaging with RNA sequencing, we show the role of endogenous retinoic acid metabolism in initiating transcriptional programs that guide the cell-fate transitions of intestinal epithelium, and we identify an inhibitor of the retinoid X receptor that improves intestinal regeneration in vivo. An organoid-based screening platform maps the genetic interactions underlying intestinal development and regeneration, showing that retinoic acid metabolism maintains the balance between regeneration and homeostasis, and that an antagonist of the retinoid X receptor promotes regeneration in vivo."], ["Bright carbonate deposits as evidence of aqueous alteration on (1) Ceres", "The typically dark surface of the dwarf planet Ceres is punctuated by areas of much higher albedo, most prominently in the Occator crater(1). These small bright areas have been tentatively interpreted as containing a large amount of hydrated magnesium sulfate(1), in contrast to the average surface, which is a mixture of lowalbedo materials and magnesium phyllosilicates, ammoniated phyllosilicates and carbonates(2-4). Here we report high spatial and spectral resolution near-infrared observations of the bright areas in the Occator crater on Ceres. Spectra of these bright areas are consistent with a large amount of sodium carbonate, constituting the most concentrated known extraterrestrial occurrence of carbonate on kilometre-wide scales in the Solar System. The carbonates are mixed with a dark component and small amounts of phyllosilicates, as well as ammonium carbonate or ammonium chloride. Some of these compounds have also been detected in the plume of Saturn's sixth-largest moon Enceladus(5). The compounds are endogenous and we propose that they are the solid residue of crystallization of brines and entrained altered solids that reached the surface from below. The heat source may have been transient (triggered by impact heating). Alternatively, internal temperatures may be above the eutectic temperature of subsurface brines, in which case fluids may exist at depth on Ceres today."], ["MicroRNAs expressed by herpes simplex virus 1 during latent infection regulate viral mRNAs", "Herpesviruses are characterized by their ability to maintain lifelong latent infections in their animal hosts. However, the mechanisms that allow establishment and maintenance of the latent state remain poorly understood. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) establishes latency in neurons of sensory ganglia, where the only abundant viral gene product is a non-coding RNA, the latency associated transcript (LAT)(1,2). Here we show that LAT functions as a primary microRNA (miRNA) precursor that encodes four distinct miRNAs in HSV-1 infected cells. One of these miRNAs, miR-H2-3p, is transcribed in an antisense orientation to ICP0-a viral immediate-early transcriptional activator that is important for productive HSV-1 replication and thought to have a role in reactivation from latency(3). We show that miR-H2-3p is able to reduce ICP0 protein expression, but does not significantly affect ICP0 messenger RNA levels. We also identified a fifth HSV-1 miRNA in latently infected trigeminal ganglia, miR-H6, which derives from a previously unknown transcript distinct from LAT. miR-H6 shows extended seed complementarity to the mRNA encoding a second HSV-1 transcription factor, ICP4, and inhibits expression of ICP4, which is required for expression of most HSV-1 genes during productive infection(4). These results may explain the reported ability of LAT to promote latency(5-9). Thus, HSV-1 expresses at least two primary miRNA precursors in latently infected neurons that may facilitate the establishment and maintenance of viral latency by post-transcriptionally regulating viral gene expression."], ["The outer membrane is an essential load-bearing element in Gram-negative bacteria", "Gram-negative bacteria possess a complex cell envelope that consists of a plasma membrane, a peptidoglycan cell wall and an outer membrane. The envelope is a selective chemical barrier(1) that defines cell shape(2) and allows the cell to sustain large mechanical loads such as turgor pressure(3.) It is widely believed that the covalently cross-linked cell wall underpins the mechanical properties of the envelope(4,5). Here we show that the stiffness and strength of Escherichia coli cells are largely due to the outer membrane. Compromising the outer membrane, either chemically or genetically, greatly increased deformation of the cell envelope in response to stretching, bending and indentation forces, and induced increased levels of cell lysis upon mechanical perturbation and during L-form proliferation. Both lipopolysaccharides and proteins contributed to the stiffness of the outer membrane. These findings overturn the prevailing dogma that the cell wall is the dominant mechanical element within Gram-negative bacteria, instead demonstrating that the outer membrane can be stiffer than the cell wall, and that mechanical loads are often balanced between these structures."], ["Targeting C-reactive protein for the treatment of cardiovascular disease", "Complement-mediated inflammation exacerbates the tissue injury of ischaemic necrosis in heart attacks and strokes, the most common causes of death in developed countries. Large infarct size increases immediate morbidity and mortality and, in survivors of the acute event, larger non-functional scars adversely affect long-term prognosis. There is thus an important unmet medical need for new cardioprotective and neuroprotective treatments. We have previously shown that human C-reactive protein (CRP), the classical acute-phase protein that binds to ligands exposed in damaged tissue and then activates complement(1), increases myocardial and cerebral infarct size in rats subjected to coronary or cerebral artery ligation, respectively(2,3). Rat CRP does not activate rat complement, whereas human CRP activates both rat and human complement(4). Administration of human CRP to rats is thus an excellent model for the actions of endogenous human CRP2,3. Here we report the design, synthesis and efficacy of 1,6-bis(phosphocholine)-hexane as a specific small-molecule inhibitor of CRP. Five molecules of this palindromic compound are bound by two pentameric CRP molecules, crosslinking and occluding the ligand-binding B-face of CRP and blocking its functions. Administration of 1,6-bis(phosphocholine)-hexane to rats undergoing acute myocardial infarction abrogated the increase in infarct size and cardiac dysfunction produced by injection of human CRP. Therapeutic inhibition of CRP is thus a promising new approach to cardioprotection in acute myocardial infarction, and may also provide neuroprotection in stroke. Potential wider applications include other inflammatory, infective and tissue-damaging conditions characterized by increased CRP production, in which binding of CRP to exposed ligands in damaged cells may lead to complement-mediated exacerbation of tissue injury."], ["Near-frictionless ion transport within triazine framework membranes", "The enhancement of separation processes and electrochemical technologies such as water electrolysers(1,2), fuel cells(3,4), redox flow batteries(5,6) and ion-capture electrodialysis(7) depends on the development of low-resistance and high-selectivity ion-transport membranes. The transport of ions through these membranes depends on the overall energy barriers imposed by the collective interplay of pore architecture and poreanalyte interaction(8,9). However, it remains challenging to design efficient, scaleable and low-cost selective ion-transport membranes that provide ion channels for low-energy-barrier transport. Here we pursue a strategy that allows the diffusion limit of ions in water to be approached for large-area, free-standing, synthetic membranes using covalently bonded polymer frameworks with rigidity-confined ion channels. The near-frictionless ion flow is synergistically fulfilled by robust micropore confinement and multi-interaction between ion and membrane, which afford, for instance, a Na+ diffusion coefficient of 1.18 x 10(-9) m(2) s(-1), close to the value in pure water at infinite dilution, and an area-specific membrane resistance as low as 0.17 Omega cm(2). We demonstrate highly efficient membranes in rapidly charging aqueous organic redox flow batteries that deliver both high energy efficiency and high-capacity utilization at extremely high current densities (up to 500 mA cm(-2)), and also that avoid crossover-induced capacity decay.

Within this phase it has been unclear which electronic symmetries (if any) are broken, what the identity of any associated order parameter might be, and which microscopic electronic degrees of freedom are active. Here we report the determination of a quantitative order parameter representing intra-unit-cell nematicity: the breaking of rotational symmetry by the electronic structure within each CuO2 unit cell. We analyse spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunnelling microscope images of the intra-unit-cell states in underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 + delta and, using two independent evaluation techniques, find evidence for electronic nematicity of the states close to the pseudogap energy. Moreover, we demonstrate directly that these phenomena arise from electronic differences at the two oxygen sites within each unit cell. If the characteristics of the pseudogap seen here and by other techniques all have the same microscopic origin, this phase involves weak magnetic states at the O sites that break 90 degrees-rotational symmetry within every CuO2 unit cell."], ["The contribution of China's emissions to global climate forcing", "Knowledge of the contribution that individual countries have made to global radiative forcing is important to the implementation of the agreement on \"common but differentiated responsibilities\" reached by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Over the past three decades, China has experienced rapid economic development(1), accompanied by increased emission of greenhouse gases, ozone precursors and aerosols(2,3), but the magnitude of the associated radiative forcing has remained unclear. Here we use a global coupled biogeochemistry-climate model(4,5) and a chemistry and transport model(6) to quantify China's present-day contribution to global radiative forcing due to well-mixed greenhouse gases, short-lived atmospheric climate forcers and land-use-induced regional surface albedo changes. We find that China contributes 10% +/- 4% of the current global radiative forcing. China's relative contribution to the positive (warming) component of global radiative forcing, mainly induced by well-mixed greenhouse gases and black carbon aerosols, is 12% +/- 2%. Its relative contribution to the negative (cooling) component is 15% +/- 6%, dominated by the effect of sulfate and nitrate aerosols. China's strongest contributions are 0.16 +/- 0.02 watts per square metre for CO2 from fossil fuel burning, 0.13 +/- 0.05 watts per square metre for CH4, -0.11 +/- 0.05 watts per square metre for sulfate aerosols, and 0.09 +/- 0.06 watts per square metre for black carbon aerosols. China's eventual goal of improving air quality will result in changes in radiative forcing in the coming years: a reduction of sulfur dioxide emissions would drive a faster future warming, unless offset by larger reductions of radiative forcing from well-mixed greenhouse gases and black carbon."], ["Role of inner solvation sheath within salt\u2013solvent complexes in tailoring electrode/electrolyte interphases for lithium metal batteries", "Functional electrolyte is the key to stabilize the highly reductive lithium (Li) metal anode and the high-voltage cathode for long-life, high-energy-density rechargeable Li metal batteries (LMBs). However, fundamental mechanisms on the interactions between reactive electrodes and electrolytes are still not well understood. Recently localized high-concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) are emerging as a promising electrolyte design strategy for LMBs. Here, we use LHCEs as an ideal platform to investigate the fundamental correlation between the reactive characteristics of the inner solvation sheath on electrode surfaces due to their unique solvation structures. The effects of a series of LHCEs with model electrolyte solvents (carbonate, sulfone, phosphate, and ether) on the stability of high-voltage LMBs are systematically studied. The stabilities of electrodes in different LHCEs indicate the intrinsic synergistic effects between the salt and the solvent when they coexist on electrode surfaces. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal an intriguing general rule that the strong interactions between the salt and the solvent in the inner solvation sheath promote their intermolecular proton/charge transfer reactions, which dictates the properties of the electrode/electrolyte interphases and thus the battery performances."], ["Genome-wide RNAi analysis of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> fat regulatory genes", "Regulation of body fat storage involves signalling between centres that regulate feeding in the brain and sites of fat storage and use in the body(1,2). Here we describe an assay for analysing fat storage and mobilization in living Caenorhabditis elegans. By using RNA-mediated interference (RNAi)(3,4) to disrupt the expression of each of the 16,757 worm genes, we have systematically screened the C. elegans genome for genes necessary for normal fat storage. We identify 305 gene inactivations that cause reduced body fat and 112 gene inactivations that cause increased fat storage. Analysis of the fat-reducing gene inactivations in insulin, serotonin and tubby signalling mutants of C. elegans, which have increased body fat, identifies a core set of fat regulatory genes as well as pathway-specific fat regulators. Many of the newly identified worm fat regulatory genes have mammalian homologues, some of which are known to function in fat regulation. Other C. elegans fat regulatory genes that are conserved across animal phylogeny, but have not previously been implicated in fat storage, may point to ancient and universal features of fat storage regulation, and identify targets for treating obesity and its associated diseases."], ["Interface superconductor with gap behaviour like a high-temperature superconductor", "The physics of the superconducting state in two-dimensional (2D) electron systems is relevant to understanding the high-transition-temperature copper oxide superconductors and for the development of future superconductors based on interface electron systems(1). But it is not yet understood how fundamental superconducting parameters, such as the spectral density of states, change when these superconducting electron systems are depleted of charge carriers. Here we use tunnel spectroscopy with planar junctions to measure the behaviour of the electronic spectral density of states as a function of carrier density, clarifying this issue experimentally. We chose the conducting LaAlO3-SrTiO3 interface(2) as the 2D superconductor, because this electron system can be tuned continuously with an electric gate field(3). We observed an energy gap of the order of 40 micro-electronvolts in the density of states, whose shape is well described by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superconducting gap function. In contrast to the dome-shaped dependence of the critical temperature, the gap increases with charge carrier depletion in both the underdoped region and the overdoped region. These results are analogous to the pseudogap behaviour of the high-transition-temperature copper oxide superconductors and imply that the smooth continuation of the superconducting gap into pseudogap-like behaviour could be a general property of 2D superconductivity."], ["Observation of topologically enabled unidirectional guided resonances", "Unidirectional radiation is important for various optoelectronic applications, such as lasers, grating couplers and optical antennas. However, almost all existing unidirectional emitters rely on the use of materials or structures that forbid outgoing waves-that is, mirrors, which are often bulky, lossy and difficult to fabricate. Here we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a class of resonances in photonic crystal slabs that radiate only towards one side of the slab, with no mirror placed on the other side. These resonances, which we name 'unidirectional guided resonances', are found to be topological in nature: they emerge when a pair of half-integer topological charges(1-3) in the polarization field bounce into each other in momentum space. We experimentally demonstrate unidirectional guided resonances in the telecommunication regime by achieving single-side radiative quality factors as high as 1.6 x 10(5). We further demonstrate their topological nature through far-field polarimetry measurements. Our work represents a characteristic example of applying topological principles(4,5) to control optical fields and could lead to energy-efficient grating couplers and antennas for light detection and ranging. Unidirectional radiation is achieved in a photonic crystal slab without the use of mirrors by merging a pair of topological defects carrying half-integer charges."], ["Site-Selective Acceptorless Dehydrogenation of Aliphatics Enabled by Organophotoredox/Cobalt Dual Catalysis", "The value of catalytic dehydrogenation of aliphatics (CDA) in organic synthesis has remained largely underexplored. Known homogeneous CDA systems often require the use of sacrificial hydrogen acceptors (or oxidants), precious metal catalysts, and harsh reaction conditions, thus limiting most existing methods to dehydrogenation of non- or low-functionalized alkanes. Here we describe a visible-light-driven, dual-catalyst system consisting of inexpensive organophotoredox and base-metal catalysts for room-temperature, acceptorless-CDA (Al-CDA). Initiated by photoexited 2-chloroanthraquinone, the process involves H atom transfer (HAT) of aliphatics to form alkyl radicals, which then react with cobaloxime to produce olefins and H2. This operationally simple method enables direct dehydrogenation of readily available chemical feedstocks to diversely functionalized olefins. For example, we demonstrate, for the first time, the oxidant-free desaturation of thioethers and amides to alkenyl sulfides and enamides, respectively. Moreover, the system\u2019s exceptional site selectivity and functional group tolerance are illustrated by late-stage dehydrogenation and synthesis of 14 biologically relevant molecules and pharmaceutical ingredients. Mechanistic studies have revealed a dual HAT process and provided insights into the origin of reactivity and site selectivity."], ["PGC1\u03b1 drives NAD biosynthesis linking oxidative metabolism to renal protection", "The energetic burden of continuously concentrating solutes against gradients along the tubule may render the kidney especially vulnerable to ischaemia. Acute kidney injury (AKI) affects 3% of all hospitalized patients(1,2). Here we show that the mitochondrial biogenesis regulator, PGC1 alpha(3,4), is a pivotal determinant of renal recovery from injury by regulating nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) biosynthesis. Following renal ischaemia, PGC1 alpha(-/-) (also known as Ppargc1a(-/-)) mice develop local deficiency of the NAD precursor niacinamide (NAM, also known as nicotinamide), marked fat accumulation, and failure to reestablish normal function. Notably, exogenous NAM improves local NAD levels, fat accumulation, and renal function in post-ischaemic PGC1 alpha(-/-) mice. Inducible tubular transgenic mice (iNephPGC1 alpha) recapitulate the effects of NAM supplementation, including more local NAD and less fat accumulation with better renal function after ischaemia. PGC1 alpha coordinately upregulates the enzymes that synthesize NAD de novo from amino acids whereas PGC1 alpha deficiency or AKI attenuates the de novo pathway. NAM enhances NAD via the enzyme NAMPT and augments production of the fat breakdown product beta-hydroxybutyrate, leading to increased production of prostaglandin PGE(2) (ref. 5), a secreted autacoid that maintains renal function. NAM treatment reverses established ischaemic AKI and also prevented AKI in an unrelated toxic model. Inhibition of beta-hydroxybutyrate signalling or prostaglandin production similarly abolishes PGC1 alpha-dependent renoprotection. Given the importance of mitochondrial health in ageing and the function of metabolically active organs, the results implicate NAM and NAD as key effectors for achieving PGC1 alpha-dependent stress resistance."], ["The comet-like composition of a protoplanetary disk as revealed by complex cyanides", "Observations of comets and asteroids show that the solar nebula that spawned our planetary system was rich in water and organic molecules. Bombardment brought these organics to the young Earth's surface(1). Unlike asteroids, comets preserve a nearly pristine record of the solar nebula composition. The presence of cyanides in comets, including 0.01 per cent of methyl cyanide (CH3CN) with respect to water, is of special interest because of the importance of C-N bonds for abiotic amino acid synthesis(2). Comet-like compositions of simple and complex volatiles are found in protostars, and can readily be explained by a combination of gas-phase chemistry (to form, for example, HCN) and an active ice-phase chemistry on grain surfaces that advances complexity(3). Simple volatiles, including water and HCN, have been detected previously in solar nebula analogues, indicating that they survive disk formation or are re-formed in situ(4-7). It has hitherto been unclear whether the same holds for more complex organic molecules outside the solar nebula, given that recent observations show a marked change in the chemistry at the boundary between nascent envelopes and young disks due to accretion shocks(8). Here we report the detection of the complex cyanides CH3CN and HC3N (and HCN) in the protoplanetary disk around the young star MWC 480. We find that the abundance ratios of these nitrogen-bearing organics in the gas phase are similar to those in comets, which suggests an even higher relative abundance of complex cyanides in the disk ice. This implies that complex organics accompany simpler volatiles in protoplanetary disks, and that the rich organic chemistry of our solar nebula was not unique."], ["Explanation far fracture spacing in layered materials", "The spacing of opening-mode fractures in layered materials-such as certain sedimentary rocks and laminated engineering materials-is often proportional to the thickness of the fractured layer(1-4). Experimental studies of this phenomenon(1,5) show that the spacing initially decreases as extensional strain increases in the direction perpendicular to the fractures. But at a certain ratio of spacing to layer thickness, no new fractures form and the additional strain is accommodated by further opening of existing fractures: the spacing then simply scales with layer thickness, which is called fracture saturation(5,6), This is in marked contrast to existing theories of fracture, such as the stress-transfer theory(7,8), which predict that spacing should decrease with increasing strain ad infinitum. Recently(9,10), two of us (T.B. and D.D,P.) have used a combination of numerical simulations and laboratory experiments to show that, with increasing applied stress, the normal stress acting between such fractures undergoes a transition from tensile to compressive, suggesting a cause for fracture saturation. Here we investigate the full stress distribution between such fractures, from which we derive an intuitive physical model of the process of fracture saturation. Such a model should find wide applicability, from geosciences(11-13,14) to engineering(1,2,6,15,16)."], ["CRISPR screens in cancer spheroids identify 3D growth-specific vulnerabilities", "Cancer genomics studies have identified thousands of putative cancer driver genes(1). Development of high-throughput and accurate models to define the functions of these genes is a major challenge. Here we devised a scalable cancer-spheroid model and performed genome-wide CRISPR screens in 2D monolayers and 3D lung-cancer spheroids. CRISPR phenotypes in 3D more accurately recapitulated those of in vivo tumours, and genes with differential sensitivities between 2D and 3D conditions were highly enriched for genes that are mutated in lung cancers. These analyses also revealed drivers that are essential for cancer growth in 3D and in vivo, but not in 2D. Notably, we found that carboxypeptidase D is responsible for removal of a C-terminal RKRR motif(2) from the alpha-chain of the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor that is critical for receptor activity. Carboxypeptidase D expression correlates with patient outcomes in patients with lung cancer, and loss of carboxypeptidase D reduced tumour growth. Our results reveal key differences between 2D and 3D cancer models, and establish a generalizable strategy for performing CRISPR screens in spheroids to reveal cancer vulnerabilities. CRISPR screens in a 3D spheroid cancer model system more accurately recapitulate cancer phenotypes than existing 2D models and were used to identify carboxypeptidase D, acting via the IGF1R, as a 3D-specific driver of cancer growth."], ["The power of genetic diversity in genome-wide association studies of lipids", "Increased blood lipid levels are heritable risk factors of cardiovascular disease with varied prevalence worldwide owing to different dietary patterns and medication use(1). Despite advances in prevention and treatment, in particular through reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels(2), heart disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide(3). Genome-wideassociation studies (GWAS) of blood lipid levels have led to important biological and clinical insights, as well as new drug targets, for cardiovascular disease. However, most previous GWAS(4-23) have been conducted in European ancestry populations and may have missed genetic variants that contribute to lipid-level variation in other ancestry groups. These include differences in allele frequencies, effect sizes and linkage-disequilibrium patterns(24). Here we conduct a multi-ancestry, genome-wide genetic discovery meta-analysis of lipid levels in approximately 1.65 million individuals, including 350,000 of non-European ancestries. We quantify the gain in studying non-European ancestries and provide evidence to support the expansion of recruitment of additional ancestries, even with relatively small sample sizes. We find that increasing diversity rather than studying additional individuals of European ancestry results in substantial improvements in fine-mapping functional variants and portability of polygenic prediction (evaluated in approximately 295,000 individuals from 7 ancestry groupings). Modest gains in the number of discovered loci and ancestry-specific variants were also achieved. As GWAS expand emphasis beyond the identification of genes and fundamental biology towards the use of genetic variants for preventive and precision medicine(25), we anticipate that increased diversity of participants will lead to more accurate and equitable(26) application of polygenic scores in clinical practice."], ["Force-induced activation of covalent bonds in mechanoresponsive polymeric materials", "Mechanochemical transduction enables an extraordinary range of physiological processes such as the sense of touch, hearing, balance, muscle contraction, and the growth and remodelling of tissue and bone(1-6). Although biology is replete with materials systems that actively and functionally respond to mechanical stimuli, the default mechanochemical reaction of bulk polymers to large external stress is the unselective scission of covalent bonds, resulting in damage or failure(7). An alternative to this degradation process is the rational molecular design of synthetic materials such that mechanical stress favourably alters material properties. A few mechanosensitive polymers with this property have been developed(8-14); but their active response is mediated through non-covalent processes, which may limit the extent to which properties can be modified and the long-term stability in structural materials. Previously, we have shown with dissolved polymer strands incorporating mechanically sensitive chemical groups-so-called mechanophores-that the directional nature of mechanical forces can selectively break and re-form covalent bonds(15,16). We now demonstrate that such force-induced covalent-bond activation can also be realized with mechanophore-linked elastomeric and glassy polymers, by using a mechanophore that changes colour as it undergoes a reversible electrocyclic ring-opening reaction under tensile stress and thus allows us to directly and locally visualize the mechanochemical reaction. We find that pronounced changes in colour and fluorescence emerge with the accumulation of plastic deformation, indicating that in these polymeric materials the transduction of mechanical force into the ring-opening reaction is an activated process. We anticipate that force activation of covalent bonds can serve as a general strategy for the development of new mechanophore building blocks that impart polymeric materials with desirable functionalities ranging from damage sensing to fully regenerative self-healing."], ["Catalytic alkylation of remote C-H bonds enabled by proton-coupled electron transfer", "Despite advances in hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalysis(1-5), there are currently no molecular HAT catalysts that are capable of homolysing the strong nitrogen-hydrogen (N-H) bonds of N-alkyl amides. The motivation to develop amide homolysis protocols stems from the utility of the resultant amidyl radicals, which are involved in various synthetically useful transformations, including olefin amination(6-11) and directed carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond functionalization(12-16). In the latter process-a subset of the classical Hofmann-Loffler-Freytag reaction-amidyl radicals remove hydrogen atoms from unactivated aliphatic C-H bonds(17-21). Although powerful, these transformations typically require oxidative N-prefunctionalization of the amide starting materials to achieve efficient amidyl generation. Moreover, because these N-activating groups are often incorporated into the final products, these methods are generally not amenable to the direct construction of carbon-carbon (C-C) bonds. Here we report an approach that overcomes these limitations by homolysing the N-H bonds of N-alkyl amides via proton-coupled electron transfer. In this protocol, an excited-state iridium photocatalyst and a weak phosphate base cooperatively serve to remove both a proton and an electron from an amide substrate in a concerted elementary step. The resultant amidyl radical intermediates are shown to promote subsequent C-H abstraction and radical alkylation steps. This C-H alkylation represents a catalytic variant of the Hofmann-Loffler-Freytag reaction, using simple, unfunctionalized amides to direct the formation of new C-C bonds. Given the prevalence of amides in pharmaceuticals and natural products, we anticipate that this method will simplify the synthesis and structural elaboration of amine-containing targets. Moreover, this study demonstrates that concerted proton-coupled electron transfer can enable homolytic activation of common organic functional groups that are energetically inaccessible using traditional HAT-based approaches."], ["High-resolution multi-dimensional NMR spectroscopy of proteins in human cells", "In-cell NMR is an isotope-aided multi-dimensional NMR technique that enables observations of conformations and functions of proteins in living cells at the atomic level(1). This method has been successfully applied to proteins overexpressed in bacteria, providing information on protein-ligand interactions(2) and conformations(3,4). However, the application of in-cell NMR to eukaryotic cells has been limited to Xenopus laevis oocytes(5-7). Wider application of the technique is hampered by inefficient delivery of isotope-labelled proteins into eukaryote somatic cells. Here we describe a method to obtain high-resolution two-dimensional (2D) heteronuclear NMR spectra of proteins inside living human cells. Proteins were delivered to the cytosol by the pyrenebutyrate-mediated action of cell-penetrating peptides(8) linked covalently to the proteins. The proteins were subsequently released from cell-penetrating peptides by endogenous enzymatic activity or by autonomous reductive cleavage. The heteronuclear 2D spectra of three different proteins inside human cells demonstrate the broad application of this technique to studying interactions and protein processing. The in-cell NMR spectra of FKBP12 (also known as FKBP1A) show the formation of specific complexes between the protein and extracellularly administered immunosuppressants, demonstrating the utility of this technique in drug screening programs. Moreover, in-cell NMRspectroscopy demonstrates that ubiquitin has much higher hydrogen exchange rates in the intracellular environment, possibly due to multiple interactions with endogenous proteins."], ["Accurate design of co-assembling multi-component protein nanomaterials", "The self-assembly of proteins into highly ordered nanoscale architectures is a hallmark of biological systems. The sophisticated functions of these molecular machines have inspired the development of methods to engineer self-assembling protein nanostructures; however, the design of multi-component protein nanomaterials with high accuracy remains an outstanding challenge. Here we report a computational method for designing protein nanomaterials in which multiple copies of two distinct subunits co-assemble into a specific architecture. We use the method to design five 24-subunit cage-like protein nanomaterials in two distinct symmetric architectures and experimentally demonstrate that their structures are in close agreement with the computational design models. The accuracy of the method and the number and variety of two-component materials that it makes accessible suggest a route to the construction of functional protein nanomaterials tailored to specific applications."], ["MEDIUM-RANGE STRUCTURAL ORDER IN COVALENT AMORPHOUS SOLIDS", "Despite their lack of long-range translational and orientational order, covalent amorphous solids can exhibit structural order over both short and medium length scales, the latter reaching to 20 angstrom or so.

With an equilibrium temperature of about 4,050 kelvin(4), the exoplanet KELT-9b (also known as HD 195689b) is an archetype of the class of ultrahot Jupiters that straddle the transition between stars and gas-giant exoplanets and are therefore useful for studying atmospheric chemistry. At these high temperatures, iron and several other transition metals are not sequestered in molecules or cloud particles and exist solely in their atomic forms(5). However, despite being the most abundant transition metal in nature, iron has not hitherto been detected directly in an exoplanet because it is highly refractory. The high temperatures of KELT-9b imply that its atmosphere is a tightly constrained chemical system that is expected to be nearly in chemical equilibrium(5) and cloud-free(6,7), and it has been predicted that spectral lines of iron should be detectable in the visible range of wavelengths(5). Here we report observations of neutral and singly ionized atomic iron (Fe and Fe+) and singly ionized atomic titanium (Ti+) in the atmosphere of KELT-9b. We identify these species using cross-correlation analysis(8) of high-resolution spectra obtained as the exoplanet passed in front of its host star. Similar detections of metals in other ultrahot Jupiters will provide constraints for planetary formation theories."], ["Making waves in a photoactive polymer film", "Oscillating materials(1-4) that adapt their shapes in response to external stimuli are of interest for emerging applications in medicine and robotics. For example, liquid-crystal networks can be programmed to undergo stimulus-induced deformations in various geometries, including in response to light(5,6). Azobenzene molecules are often incorporated into liquid-crystal polymer films to make them photoresponsive(7-11); however, in most cases only the bending responses of these films have been studied, and relaxation after photo-isomerization is rather slow. Modifying the core or adding substituents to the azobenzene moiety can lead to marked changes in photophysical and photochemical properties(12-15), providing an opportunity to circumvent the use of a complex set-up that involves multiple light sources, lenses or mirrors. Here, by incorporating azobenzene derivatives with fast cis-to-trans thermal relaxation into liquid-crystal networks, we generate photoactive polymer films that exhibit continuous, directional, macroscopic mechanical waves under constant light illumination, with a feedback loop that is driven by self-shadowing. We explain the mechanism of wave generation using a theoretical model and numerical simulations, which show good qualitative agreement with our experiments. We also demonstrate the potential application of our photoactive films in light-driven locomotion and self-cleaning surfaces, and anticipate further applications in fields such as photomechanical energy harvesting and miniaturized transport."], ["A <i>Drosophila</i> model of Parkinson's disease", "Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative syndrome characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, formation of filamentous intraneuronal inclusions (Lewy bodies) and an extrapyramidal movement disorder. Mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene are linked to familial Parkinson's disease(1,2) and alpha-synuclein accumulates in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites(3-5). Here we express normal and mutant forms of alpha-synuclein in Drosophila and produce adult-onset loss of dopaminergic neurons, filamentous intraneuronal inclusions containing alpha-synuclein and locomotor dysfunction. Our Drosophila model thus recapitulates the essential features of the human disorder, and makes possible a powerful genetic approach to Parkinson's disease."], ["Superparamagnetic enhancement of thermoelectric performance", "The ability to control chemical and physical structuring at the nanometre scale is important for developing high-performance thermoelectric materials(1). Progress in this area has been achieved mainly by enhancing phonon scattering and consequently decreasing the thermal conductivity of the lattice through the design of either interface structures at nanometre or mesoscopic length scales(2-6) or multiscale hierarchical architectures(7,8). A nanostructuring approach that enables electron transport as well as phonon transport to be manipulated could potentially lead to further enhancements in thermoelectric performance. Here we show that by embedding nanoparticles of a soft magnetic material in a thermoelectric matrix we achieve dual control of phonon-and electron-transport properties. The properties of the nanoparticles-in particular, their superparamagnetic behaviour (in which the nanoparticles can be magnetized similarly to a paramagnet under an external magnetic field)-lead to three kinds of thermoelectromagnetic effect: charge transfer from the magnetic inclusions to the matrix; multiple scattering of electrons by superparamagnetic fluctuations; and enhanced phonon scattering as a result of both the magnetic fluctuations and the nanostructures themselves. We show that together these effects can effectively manipulate electron and phonon transport at nanometre and mesoscopic length scales and thereby improve the thermoelectric performance of the resulting nanocomposites."], ["CO<sub>2</sub> storage and release in the deep Southern Ocean on millennial to centennial timescales", "The cause of changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) during the recent ice ages is yet to be fully explained. Most mechanisms for glacial-interglacial CO2 change have centred on carbon exchange with the deep ocean, owing to its large size and relatively rapid exchange with the atmosphere(1). The Southern Ocean is thought to have a key role in this exchange, as much of the deep ocean is ventilated to the atmosphere in this region(2). However, it is difficult to reconstruct changes in deep Southern Ocean carbon storage, so few direct tests of this hypothesis have been carried out. Here we present deep-sea coral boron isotope data that track the pH-and thus the CO2 chemistry-of the deep Southern Ocean over the past forty thousand years. At sites closest to the Antarctic continental margin, and most influenced by the deep southern waters that form the ocean's lower overturning cell, we find a close relationship between ocean pH and atmospheric CO2: during intervals of low CO2, ocean pH is low, reflecting enhanced ocean carbon storage; and during intervals of rising CO2, ocean pH rises, reflecting loss of carbon from the ocean to the atmosphere. Correspondingly, at shallower sites we find rapid (millennial-to centennial-scale) decreases in pH during abrupt increases in CO2, reflecting the rapid transfer of carbon from the deep ocean to the upper ocean and atmosphere. Our findings confirm the importance of the deep Southern Ocean in ice-age CO2 change, and show that deep-ocean CO2 release can occur as a dynamic feedback to rapid climate change on centennial timescales."], ["Regulation of \u03b1-synuclein by chaperones in mammalian cells", "Neurodegeneration in patients with Parkinson's disease is correlated with the occurrence of Lewy bodies-intracellular inclusions that contain aggregates of the intrinsically disordered protein alpha-synuclein(1). The aggregation propensity of alpha-synuclein in cells is modulated by specific factors that include post-translational modifications(2,3), Abelson-kinase-mediated phosphorylation(4,5) and interactions with intracellular machineries such as molecular chaperones, although the underlying mechanisms are unclear(6-8). Here we systematically characterize the interaction of molecular chaperones with alpha-synuclein in vitro as well as in cells at the atomic level. We find that six highly divergent molecular chaperones commonly recognize a canonical motif in alpha-synuclein, consisting of the N terminus and a segment around Tyr39, and hinder the aggregation of alpha-synuclein. NMR experiments(9) in cells show that the same transient interaction pattern is preserved inside living mammalian cells. Specific inhibition of the interactions between alpha-synuclein and the chaperone HSC70 and members of the HSP90 family, including HSP90 beta, results in transient membrane binding and triggers a remarkable re-localization of alpha-synuclein to the mitochondria and concomitant formation of aggregates. Phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein at Tyr39 directly impairs the interaction of alpha-synuclein with chaperones, thus providing a functional explanation for the role of Abelson kinase in Parkinson's disease. Our results establish a master regulatory mechanism of alpha-synuclein function and aggregation in mammalian cells, extending the functional repertoire of molecular chaperones and highlighting new perspectives for therapeutic interventions for Parkinson's disease."], ["Cenozoic magmatism throughout east Africa resulting from impact of a single plume", "The geology of northern and central Africa is characterized by broad plateaux, narrower swells and volcanism occurring from similar to 45 Myr ago to the present. The greatest magma volumes occur on the >1,000-km-wide Ethiopian and east African plateaux, which are transected by the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden and east African rift systems, active since the late Oligocene epoch. Evidence for one or more mantle plumes having impinged beneath the plateaux comes from the dynamic compensation inferred from gravity studies, the generally small degrees of extension observed and the geochemistry of voluminous eruptive products(1-4). Here we present a model of a single large plume impinging beneath the Ethiopian plateau that takes into account lateral flow and ponding of plume material in pre-existing zones of lithospheric thinning(5), We show that this single plume can explain the distribution and timing of magmatism and uplift throughout east Africa. The thin lithosphere beneath the Mesozoic-Palaeogene rifts and passive margins of Africa and Arabia guides the lateral flow of plume material west to the Cameroon volcanic line and south to the Comoros Islands. Our results demonstrate the strong control that the lithosphere exerts on the spatial distribution of plume-related melting and magmatism."], ["STED microscopy reveals that synaptotagmin remains clustered after synaptic vesicle exocytosis", "Synaptic transmission is mediated by neurotransmitters that are stored in synaptic vesicles and released by exocytosis upon activation. The vesicle membrane is then retrieved by endocytosis, and synaptic vesicles are regenerated and re-filled with neurotransmitter(1). Although many aspects of vesicle recycling are understood, the fate of the vesicles after fusion is still unclear. Do their components diffuse on the plasma membrane, or do they remain together? This question has been difficult to answer because synaptic vesicles are too small (similar to 40 nm in diameter) and too densely packed to be resolved by available fluorescence microscopes. Here we use stimulated emission depletion (STED)(2) to reduce the focal spot area by about an order of magnitude below the diffraction limit, thereby resolving individual vesicles in the synapse. We show that synaptotagmin I, a protein resident in the vesicle membrane, remains clustered in isolated patches on the presynaptic membrane regardless of whether the nerve terminals are mildly active or intensely stimulated. This suggests that at least some vesicle constituents remain together during recycling. Our study also demonstrates that questions involving cellular structures with dimensions of a few tens of nanometres can be resolved with conventional far-field optics and visible light."], ["STING is a direct innate immune sensor of cyclic di-GMP", "The innate immune system detects infection by using germline-encoded receptors that are specific for conserved microbial molecules. The recognition of microbial ligands leads to the production of cytokines, such as type I interferons (IFNs), that are essential for successful pathogen elimination. Cytosolic detection of pathogen-derived DNA is one major mechanism of inducing IFN production(1,2), and this process requires signalling through TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and its downstream transcription factor, IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). In addition, a transmembrane protein called STING (stimulator of IFN genes; also known as MITA, ERIS, MPYS and TMEM173) functions as an essential signalling adaptor, linking the cytosolic detection of DNA to the TBK1-IRF3 signalling axis(3-7). Recently, unique nucleic acids called cyclic dinucleotides, which function as conserved signalling molecules in bacteria(8), have also been shown to induce a STING-dependent type I IFN response(9-12). However, a mammalian sensor of cyclic dinucleotides has not been identified. Here we report evidence that STING itself is an innate immune sensor of cyclic dinucleotides. We demonstrate that STING binds directly to radiolabelled cyclic diguanylate monophosphate (c-di-GMP), and we show that unlabelled cyclic dinucleotides, but not other nucleotides or nucleic acids, compete with c-di-GMP for binding to STING. Furthermore, we identify mutations in STING that selectively affect the response to cyclic dinucleotides without affecting the response to DNA. Thus, STING seems to function as a direct sensor of cyclic dinucleotides, in addition to its established role as a signalling adaptor in the IFN response to cytosolic DNA. Cyclic dinucleotides have shown promise as novel vaccine adjuvants and immunotherapeutics(9,13), and our results provide insight into the mechanism by which cyclic dinucleotides are sensed by the innate immune system."], ["Patterning by controlled cracking", "Crack formation drives material failure and is often regarded as a process to be avoided(1-3). However, closer examination of cracking phenomena has revealed exquisitely intricate patterns such as spirals(4), oscillating(5,6,7) and branched(7) fracture paths and fractal geometries(8). Here we demonstrate the controlled initiation, propagation and termination of a variety of channelled crack patterns in a film/substrate system(9-11) comprising a silicon nitride thin film deposited on a silicon substrate using low-pressure chemical vapour deposition. Micro-notches etched into the silicon substrate concentrated stress for crack initiation, which occurred spontaneously during deposition of the silicon nitride layer. We reproducibly created three distinct crack morphologies-straight, oscillatory and orderly bifurcated (stitchlike)-through careful selection of processing conditions and parameters. We induced direction changes by changing the system parameters, and we terminated propagation at preformed multi-step crack stops. We believe that our patterning technique presents new opportunities in nanofabrication and offers a starting point for atomic-scale pattern formation(12), which would be difficult even with current state-of-the-art nanofabrication methodologies."], ["Topological valley transport at bilayer graphene domain walls", "Electron valley, a degree of freedom that is analogous to spin, can lead to novel topological phases in bilayer graphene. A tunable bandgap can be induced in bilayer graphene by an external electric field', and such gapped bilayer graphene is predicted to be a topological insulating phase protected by no-valley mixing symmetry, featuring quantum valley Hall effects and chiral edge states'. Observation of such chiral edge states, however, is challenging because inter-valley scattering is induced by atomic-scale defects at real bilayer graphene edges\". Recent theoretical work\"' has shown that domain walls between AB- and BA-stacked bilayer graphene can support protected chiral edge states of quantum valley Hall insulators. Here we report an experimental observation of ballistic (that is, with no scattering of electrons) conducting channels at bilayer graphene domain walls. We employ near-field infrared nanometre-scale microscopy (nanoscopy)'\" to image in situ bilayer graphene layer-stacking domain walls on device substrates, and we fabricate dual-gated field effect transistors based on the domain walls. Unlike single-domain bilayer graphene, which shows gapped insulating behaviour under a vertical electrical field, bilayer graphene domain walls feature one-dimensional valley-polarized conducting channels with a ballistic length of about 400 nanometres at 4 kelvin. Such topologically protected one-dimensional chiral states at bilayer graphene domain walls open up opportunities for exploring unique topological phases and valley physics in graphene."], ["Odorant reception in the malaria mosquito <i>Anopheles gambiae</i>", "The mosquito Anopheles gambiae is the major vector of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. It locates its human hosts primarily through olfaction, but little is known about the molecular basis of this process. Here we functionally characterize the Anopheles gambiae odorant receptor (AgOr) repertoire. We identify receptors that respond strongly to components of human odour and that may act in the process of human recognition. Some of these receptors are narrowly tuned, and some salient odorants elicit strong responses from only one or a few receptors, suggesting a central role for specific transmission channels in human host-seeking behaviour. This analysis of the Anopheles gambiae receptors permits a comparison with the corresponding Drosophila melanogaster odorant receptor repertoire. We find that odorants are differentially encoded by the two species in ways consistent with their ecological needs. Our analysis of the Anopheles gambiae repertoire identifies receptors that may be useful targets for controlling the transmission of malaria."], ["Rational design of a new antibiotic class for drug-resistant infections", "The development of new antibiotics to treat infections caused by drug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens is of paramount importance as antibiotic resistance continues to increase worldwide(1). Here we describe a strategy for the rational design of diazabicyclooctane inhibitors of penicillin-binding proteins from Gram-negative bacteria to overcome multiple mechanisms of resistance, including beta-lactamase enzymes, stringent response and outer membrane permeation. Diazabicyclooctane inhibitors retain activity in the presence of beta-lactamases, the primary resistance mechanism associated with beta-lactam therapy in Gram-negative bacteria(2,3). Although the target spectrum of an initial lead was successfully re-engineered to gain in vivo efficacy, its ability to permeate across bacterial outer membranes was insufficient for further development. Notably, the features that enhanced target potency were found to preclude compound uptake. An improved optimization strategy leveraged porin permeation properties concomitant with biochemical potency in the lead-optimization stage. This resulted in ETX0462, which has potent in vitro and in vivo activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa plus all other Gram-negative ESKAPE pathogens, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and biothreat pathogens. These attributes, along with a favourable preclinical safety profile, hold promise for the successful clinical development of the first novel Gram-negative chemotype to treat life-threatening antibiotic-resistant infections in more than 25 years."], ["The purinergic receptor P2RX7 directs metabolic fitness of long-lived memory CD8<SUP>+</SUP> T cells", "Extracellular ATP (eATP) is an ancient 'danger signal' used by eukaryotes to detect cellular damage(1). In mice and humans, the release of eATP during inflammation or injury stimulates both innate immune activation and chronic pain through the purinergic receptor P2RX7(2-4). It is unclear, however, whether this pathway influences the generation of immunological memory, a hallmark of the adaptive immune system that constitutes the basis of vaccines and protective immunity against re-infection(5,6). Here we show that P2RX7 is required for the establishment, maintenance and functionality of long-lived central and tissue-resident memory CD8(+) T cell populations in mice. By contrast, P2RX7 is not required for the generation of short-lived effector CD8(+) T cells. Mechanistically, P2RX7 promotes mitochondrial homeostasis and metabolic function in differentiating memory CD8(+) T cells, at least in part by inducing AMP-activated protein kinase. Pharmacological inhibitors of P2RX7 provoked dysregulated metabolism and differentiation of activated mouse and human CD8(+) T cells in vitro, and transient P2RX7 blockade in vivo ameliorated neuropathic pain but also compromised production of CD8(+) memory T cells. These findings show that activation of P2RX7 by eATP provides a common currency that both alerts the nervous and immune system to tissue damage, and promotes the metabolic fitness and survival of the most durable and functionally relevant memory CD8(+) T cell populations."], ["Direct imaging of single-molecule electrochemical reactions in solution", "Optical imaging of single-molecule electrochemical reactions in aqueous solution enables super-resolution electrochemiluminescence microscopy, which can be used to monitor the adhesion dynamics of live cells with high spatiotemporal resolution. Chemical reactions tend to be conceptualized in terms of individual molecules transforming into products, but are usually observed in experiments that probe the average behaviour of the ensemble. Single-molecule methods move beyond ensemble averages and reveal the statistical distribution of reaction positions, pathways and dynamics(1-3). This has been shown with optical traps and scanning probe microscopy manipulating and observing individual reactions at defined locations with high spatial resolution(4,5), and with modern optical methods using ultrasensitive photodetectors(3,6,7) that enable high-throughput single-molecule measurements. However, effective probing of single-molecule solution chemistry remains challenging. Here we demonstrate optical imaging of single-molecule electrochemical reactions(7) in aqueous solution and its use for super-resolution microscopy. The method utilizes a chemiluminescent reaction involving a ruthenium complex electrochemically generated at an electrode(8), which ensures minimal background signal. This allows us to directly capture single photons of the electrochemiluminescence of individual reactions, and to develop super-resolved electrochemiluminescence microscopy for imaging the adhesion dynamics of live cells with high spatiotemporal resolution.

Most fuel-cell research has involved the use of hydrogen as the fuel, although the practical generation and storage of hydrogen remains an important technological hurdle(2). Methane has been successfully oxidized electrochemically(3-6), but the susceptibility to carbon formation from other hydrocarbons that may be present or poor power densities have prevented the application of this simple fuel in practical applications(1). Here we report the direct, electrochemical oxidation of various hydrocarbons (methane, ethane, 1-butene, n-butane and toluene) using a solid-oxide fuel cell at 973 and 1,073 K with a composite anode of copper and ceria (or samaria-doped ceria). We demonstrate that the final products of the oxidation are CO2 and water, and that reasonable power densities can be achieved.

Although severe COVID-19 is linked to substantial inflammation, how SARS-CoV-2 triggers inflammation is not clear(2). Monocytes and macrophages are sentinel cells that sense invasive infection to form inflammasomes that activate caspase-1 and gasdermin D, leading to inflammatory death (pyroptosis) and the release of potent inflammatory mediators3. Here we show that about 6% of blood monocytes of patients with COVID-19 are infected with SARS-CoV-2. Monocyte infection depends on the uptake of antibody-opsonized virus by Fc. receptors. The plasma of vaccine recipients does not promote antibody-dependent monocyte infection. SARS-CoV-2 begins to replicate in monocytes, but infection is aborted, and infectious virus is not detected in the supernatants of cultures of infected monocytes. Instead, infected cells undergo pyroptosis mediated by activation of NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes, caspase-1 and gasdermin D. Moreover, tissue-resident macrophages, but not infected epithelial and endothelial cells, from lung autopsies from patients with COVID-19 have activated inflammasomes. Taken together, these findings suggest that antibody-mediated SARS-CoV-2 uptake by monocytes and macrophages triggers inflammatory cell death that aborts the production of infectious virus but causes systemic inflammation that contributes to COVID-19 pathogenesis."], ["Superconductivity at 43 K in SmFeAsO<sub>1-<i>x</i></sub>F<i><sub>x</sub></i>", "Since the discovery of high- transition- temperature ( high-T(c)) superconductivity in layered copper oxides, extensive effort has been devoted to exploring the origins of this phenomenon. A T(c) higher than 40 K ( about the theoretical maximum predicted from Bardeen - Cooper - Schrieffer theory(1)), however, has been obtained only in the copper oxide superconductors. The highest reported value for non- copper- oxide bulk superconductivity is T(c) = 39 K in MgB(2) ( ref. 2). The layered rare- earth metal oxypnictides LnOFeAs ( where Ln is La - Nd, Sm and Gd) are now attracting attention following the discovery of superconductivity at 26 K in the iron-based LaO(1-x)F(x)FeAs ( ref. 3). Here we report the discovery of bulk superconductivity in the related compound SmFeAsO(1-x)F(x), which has a ZrCuSiAs-type structure. Resistivity and magnetization measurements reveal a transition temperature as high as 43 K.

In the case of sp3-hybridized carbon, the carbon can be stereogenic and the particular stereochemistry can have implications for structure and function1,2,3. As a consequence, the development of methods that simultaneously construct alkyl\u2013alkyl bonds and control stereochemistry is important, although challenging. Here we describe a strategy for enantioselective alkyl\u2013alkyl bond formation, in which a racemic alkyl electrophile is coupled with an olefin in the presence of a hydrosilane, rather than via a traditional electrophile\u2013nucleophile cross-coupling, through the action of a chiral nickel catalyst.

Previous nanoscale weaves(2-16) include isotropic crystalline covalent organic frameworks(12-14) that feature rigid helical strands interlaced in all three dimensions, rather than the two-dimensional(17,18) layers of flexible woven strands that give conventional textiles their characteristic flexibility, thinness, anisotropic strength and porosity. A supramolecular two-dimensional kagome weave(15) and a single-layer, surface-supported, interwoven two-dimensional polymer(16) have also been reported. The direct, bottom-up assembly of molecular building blocks into linear organic polymer chains woven in two dimensions has been proposed on a number of occasions(19-23), but has not previously been achieved. Here we demonstrate that by using an anion and metal ion template, woven molecular 'tiles' can be tessellated into a material consisting of alternating aliphatic and aromatic segmented polymer strands, interwoven within discrete layers. Connections between slowly precipitating pre-woven grids, followed by the removal of the ion template, result in a wholly organic molecular material that forms as stacks and clusters of thin sheets-each sheet up to hundreds of micrometres long and wide but only about four nanometres thick-in which warp and weft single-chain polymer strands remain associated through periodic mechanical entanglements within each sheet. Atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy show clusters and, occasionally, isolated individual sheets that, following demetallation, have slid apart from others with which they were stacked during the tessellation and polymerization process. The layered two-dimensional molecularly woven material has long-range order, is birefringent, is twice as stiff as the constituent linear polymer, and delaminates and tears along well-defined lines in the manner of a macroscopic textile. When incorporated into a polymer-supported membrane, it acts as a net, slowing the passage of large ions while letting smaller ions through."], ["Aerial additive manufacturing with multiple autonomous robots", "Additive manufacturing methods(1-4) using static and mobile robots are being developed for both on-site construction(5-8) and off-site prefabrication(9,10). Here we introduce a method of additive manufacturing, referred to as aerial additive manufacturing (Aerial-AM), that utilizes a team of aerial robots inspired by natural builders(11) such as wasps who use collective building methods(12,13). We present a scalable multi-robot three-dimensional (3D) printing and path-planning framework that enables robot tasks and population size to be adapted to variations in print geometry throughout a building mission. The multi-robot manufacturing framework allows for autonomous three-dimensional printing under human supervision, real-time assessment of printed geometry and robot behavioural adaptation. To validate autonomous Aerial-AM based on the framework, we develop BuilDrones for depositing materials during flight and ScanDrones for measuring the print quality, and integrate a generic real-time model-predictive-control scheme with the Aerial-AM robots. In addition, we integrate a dynamically self-aligning delta manipulator with the BuilDrone to further improve the manufacturing accuracy to five millimetres for printing geometry with precise trajectory requirements, and develop four cementitious-polymeric composite mixtures suitable for continuous material deposition. We demonstrate proof-of-concept prints including a cylinder 2.05 metres high consisting of 72 layers of a rapid-curing insulation foam material and a cylinder 0.18 metres high consisting of 28 layers of structural pseudoplastic cementitious material, a light-trail virtual print of a dome-like geometry, and multi-robot simulations.

Intense light fields have facilitated milestones along this way, including the induction of novel states of matter(1-3), ballistic acceleration of electrons(4-7) and coherent flipping of the valley pseudospin(8). These dynamics leave unique 'fingerprints', such as characteristic bandgaps or high-order harmonic radiation. The fastest and least dissipative way of switching the technologically most important quantum attribute-the spin-between two states separated by a potential barrier is to trigger an all-coherent precession. Experimental and theoretical studies with picosecond electric and magnetic fields have suggested this possibility(9-11), yet observing the actual spin dynamics has remained out of reach. Here we show that terahertz electromagnetic pulses allow coherent steering of spins over a potential barrier, and we report the corresponding temporal and spectral fingerprints. This goal is achieved by coupling spins in antiferromagnetic TmFeO3 (thulium orthoferrite) with the locally enhanced terahertz electric field of custom-tailored antennas. Within their duration of one picosecond, the intense terahertz pulses abruptly change the magnetic anisotropy and trigger a large-amplitude ballistic spin motion. A characteristic phase flip, an asymmetric splitting of the collective spin resonance and a long-lived offset of the Faraday signal are hallmarks of coherent spin switching into adjacent potential minima, in agreement with numerical simulations. The switchable states can be selected by an external magnetic bias. The low dissipation and the antenna's subwavelength spatial definition could facilitate scalable spin devices operating at terahertz rates."], ["Coherent quantum phase slip", "A hundred years after the discovery of superconductivity, one fundamental prediction of the theory, coherent quantum phase slip (CQPS), has not been observed. CQPS is a phenomenon exactly dual(1) to the Josephson effect; whereas the latter is a coherent transfer of charges between superconducting leads(2,3), the former is a coherent transfer of vortices or fluxes across a superconducting wire. In contrast to previously reported observations(4-8) of incoherent phase slip, CQPS has been only a subject of theoretical study(9-12). Its experimental demonstration is made difficult by quasiparticle dissipation due to gapless excitations in nanowires or in vortex cores. This difficulty might be overcome by using certain strongly disordered superconductors near the superconductor-insulator transition. Here we report direct observation of CQPS in a narrow segment of a superconducting loop made of strongly disordered indium oxide; the effect is made manifest through the superposition of quantum states with different numbers of flux quanta(13). As with the Josephson effect, our observation should lead to new applications in superconducting electronics and quantum metrology(1,10,11)."], ["A dissipatively stabilized Mott insulator of photons", "Superconducting circuits are a competitive platform for quantum computation because they offer controllability, long coherence times and strong interactions-properties that are essential for the study of quantum materials comprising microwave photons. However, intrinsic photon losses in these circuits hinder the realization of quantum many-body phases. Here we use superconducting circuits to explore strongly correlated quantum matter by building a Bose-Hubbard lattice for photons in the strongly interacting regime. We develop a versatile method for dissipative preparation of incompressible many-body phases through reservoir engineering and apply it to our system to stabilize a Mott insulator of photons against losses. Site- and time-resolved readout of the lattice allows us to investigate the microscopic details of the thermalization process through the dynamics of defect propagation and removal in the Mott phase. Our experiments demonstrate the power of superconducting circuits for studying strongly correlated matter in both coherent and engineered dissipative settings. In conjunction with recently demonstrated superconducting microwave Chern insulators, we expect that our approach will enable the exploration of topologically ordered phases of matter."], ["Catalytic, Stereoselective Dihalogenation of Alkenes: Challenges and Opportunities", "Although recent years have witnessed significant advances in the development of catalytic, enantioselective halofunctionalizations of alkenes, the related dihalogenation of olefins to afford enantioenriched vicinal dihalide products remains comparatively underdeveloped. However, the growing number of complex natural products bearing halogen atoms at stereogenic centers has underscored this critical gap in the synthetic chemist\u2019s arsenal. This Review highlights the selectivity challenges inherent in the design of enantioselective dihalogenation processes, and formulates a mechanism-based classification of alkene dihalogenations, including those that may circumvent the \u201cclassical\u201d haliranium (or alkene-dihalogen \u03c0-complex) intermediates.

AcrB is a homotrimer that acts as a tripartite complex(9,10) with the outer membrane channel TolC(11,12) and the membrane fusion protein AcrA(13,14). Minocycline and doxorubicin have been shown to bind to the phenylalanine cluster region of the binding monomer(15). Here we report the crystal structures of AcrB bound to the high-molecular-mass drugs rifampicin and erythromycin. These drugs bind to the access monomer, and the binding sites are located in the proximal multisite binding pocket, which is separated from the phenylalanine cluster region (distal pocket) by the Phe-617 loop. Our structures indicate that there are two discrete multisite binding pockets along the intramolecular channel. High-molecular-mass drugs first bind to the proximal pocket in the access state and are then forced into the distal pocket in the binding state by a peristaltic mechanism involving subdomain movements that include a shift of the Phe-617 loop. By contrast, low-molecular-mass drugs, such as minocycline and doxorubicin, travel through the proximal pocket without specific binding and immediately bind to the distal pocket. The presence of two discrete, high-volume multisite binding pockets contributes to the remarkably broad substrate recognition of AcrB."], ["High-brightness all-polymer stretchable LED with charge-trapping dilution", "Next-generation light-emitting displays on skin should be soft, stretchable and bright(1-)(7). Previously reported stretchable light-emitting devices were mostly based on inorganic nanomaterials, such as light-emitting capacitors, quantum dots or perovskites(6-11). They either require high operating voltage or have limited stretchability and brightness, resolution or robustness under strain. On the other hand, intrinsically stretchable polymer materials hold the promise of good strain tolerance(12,13). However, realizing high brightness remains a grand challenge for intrinsically stretchable light-emitting diodes. Here we report a material design strategy and fabrication processes to achieve stretchable all-polymer-based light-emitting diodes with high brightness (about 7,450 candela per square metre), current efficiency (about 5.3 candela per ampere) and stretchability (about 100 per cent strain).

The enzyme co-factor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is involved in the production of monoamine neurotransmitters, the generation of nitric oxide, and pain(1,2). Here we uncover a link between these processes, identifying a fundamental role for BH4 in T cell biology. We find that genetic inactivation of GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1, the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of BH4) and inhibition of sepiapterin reductase (the terminal enzyme in the synthetic pathway for BH4) severely impair the proliferation of mature mouse and human T cells. BH4 production in activated T cells is linked to alterations in iron metabolism and mitochondrial bioenergetics. In vivo blockade of BH4 synthesis abrogates T-cell-mediated autoimmunity and allergic inflammation, and enhancing BH4 levels through GCH1 overexpression augments responses by CD4-and CD8-expressing T cells, increasing their antitumour activity in vivo. Administration of BH4 to mice markedly reduces tumour growth and expands the population of intratumoral effector T cells. Kynurenine-a tryptophan metabolite that blocks antitumour immunity-inhibits T cell proliferation in a manner that can be rescued by BH4. Finally, we report the development of a potent SPR antagonist for possible clinical use.

Although correlated effects have been observed in several other moire system(7-17), magic-angle twisted bilayergraphene remains the only one in which robust superconductivity has been reproducibly measured(4-6). Here we realize a moire superconductor in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATTG)(18), which has better tunability of its electronic structure and superconducting properties than magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. Measurements ofthe Hall effect and quantum oscillations as a function of density and electric field enable us to determine the tunable phase boundaries of the system in the normal metallic state. Zero-magnetic-field resistivity measurements reveal that the existence of superconductivity is intimately connected to the broken-symmetry phase that emerges from two carriers per moire unit cell. We find that the superconducting phase is suppressed and bounded at the Van Hove singularities that partially surround the broken-symmetry phase, which is difficult to reconcile with weak-coupling Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. Moreover, the extensive in situ tunability of our system allows us to reach the ultrastrong-coupling regime, characterized by a Ginzburg-Landau coherence length that reaches the average inter-particle distance, and very large T-BKT/F, values, in excess of 0.1 (where T-BKT and T-F are the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition and Fermi temperatures, respectively). These observations suggest that MATTG can be electrically tuned close to the crossover to a two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate.

One approach for preparing mesoscopic magnetic materials is to fragment bulk ferromagnets; a more controllable method is to take a 'bottom-up' approach, using chemistry to grow well defined clusters of metal ions5,6. Lis7 has described a twelve-ion manganese cluster in which eight of the Mn ions are in the +3 oxidation state (spin S = 2) and four are in the +4 state (S = 3/2). These ions are magnetically coupled to give an S = 10 ground state, giving rise to unusual magnetic relaxation properties8,9. Here we report that the magnetization of the Mn12 cluster is highly anisotropic and that the magnetization relaxation time becomes very long below a temperature of 4 K, giving rise to pronounced hysteresis. This behaviour is not, however, strictly analogous to that of a bulk ferromagnet, in which magnetization hysteresis results from the motion of domain walls.

Despite the different structures and functions of molybdenum-dependent enzymes, there are important similarities, which we highlight here.

Although some progress has been made in strategies to synthesize helical and chiral zeolite-like materials(1-3), the synthesis of enantiomerically pure mesoporous materials is a challenge that remains unsolved(4). Here we report the surfactant-templated synthesis of ordered chiral mesoporous silica, together with a general approach for the structural analysis of chiral mesoporous crystals by electron microscopy. The material that we have synthesized has a twisted hexagonal rodlike morphology, with diameter 130-180 nm and length 1-6 mum. Transmission electron microscopy combined with computer simulations confirm the presence of hexagonally ordered chiral channels of 2.2 nm diameter winding around the central axis of the rods.

However, the bulk-edge correspondence-which has been widely used in experiments to determine the band topology from edge propertiesis inadequate in discerning various topological crystalline phases(7-16), leading to challenges in the experimental classification of the large family of topological crystalline materials(4-6). It has been theoretically predicted that disclinationsubiquitous crystallographic defects-can provide an effective probe of crystalline topology beyond edges(17-19), but this has not yet been confirmed in experiments. Here we report an experimental demonstration of bulk-disclination correspondence, which manifests as fractional spectral charge and robust bound states at the disclinations. The fractional disclination charge originates from thesymmetry-protected bulk charge patterns-a fundamental property of many topological crystalline insulators (TCIs). Furthermore, the robust bound states at disclinations emerge as a secondary, but directly observable, property of TCIs. Using reconfigurable photonic crystals as photonic TCIs with higher-order topology, we observe these hallmark features via pump-probe and near-field detection measurements. It is shown that both the fractional charge and the localized states emerge at the disclination in the TCI phase but vanish in the trivial phase.

Their atomic thickness and large-scale synthesis capability could enable the development of 'smart skin'(1,3-5), which could transform ordinary objects into an intelligent distributed sensor network(6). However, although many important components of such a distributed electronic system have already been demonstrated (for example, transistors, sensors and memory devices based on two-dimensional materials(1,2,4,7)), an efficient, flexible and always-on energy-harvesting solution, which is indispensable for self-powered systems, is still missing. Electromagnetic radiation from Wi-Fi systems operating at 2.4 and 5.9 gigahertz(8) is becoming increasingly ubiquitous and would be ideal to harvest for powering future distributed electronics. However, the high frequencies used for Wi-Fi communications have remained elusive to radiofrequency harvesters (that is, rectennas) made of flexible semiconductors owing to their limited transport properties(9-12). Here we demonstrate an atomically thin and flexible rectenna based on a MoS2 semiconducting-metallic-phase heterojunction with a cutoff frequency of 10 gigahertz, which represents an improvement in speed of roughly one order of magnitude compared with current state-of-the-art flexible rectifiers(9-12). This flexible MoS2-based rectifier operates up to the X-band(8) (8 to 12 gigahertz) and covers most of the unlicensed industrial, scientific and medical radio band, including the Wi-Fi channels. By integrating the ultrafast MoS2 rectifier with a flexible Wi-Fi-band antenna, we fabricate a fully flexible and integrated rectenna that achieves wireless energy harvesting of electromagnetic radiation in the Wi-Fi band with zero external bias (battery-free). Moreover, our MoS2 rectifier acts as a flexible mixer, realizing frequency conversion beyond 10 gigahertz.

Although coherence has been shown to yield transformative ways for improving function, advances have been confined to pristine matter and coherence was considered fragile. However, recent evidence of coherence in chemical and biological systems suggests that the phenomena are robust and can survive in the face of disorder and noise. Here we survey the state of recent discoveries, present viewpoints that suggest that coherence can be used in complex chemical systems, and discuss the role of coherence as a design element in realizing function."], ["Iron-catalysed tritiation of pharmaceuticals", "A thorough understanding of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of a drug in animal models is a critical component of drug discovery and development(1-6). Such studies are performed in vivo and in vitro at various stages of the development process-ranging from preclinical absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) studies to late-stage human clinical trials-to elucidate a drug molecule's metabolic profile and to assess its toxicity(2). Radiolabelled compounds, typically those that contain C-14 or H-3 isotopes, are one of the most powerful and widely deployed diagnostics for these studies(4,5). The introduction of radiolabels using synthetic chemistry enables the direct tracing of the drug molecule without substantially altering its structure or function. The ubiquity of C-H bonds in drugs and the relative ease and low cost associated with tritium (H-3) make it an ideal radioisotope with which to conduct ADME studies early in the drug development process(2,4,6). Here we describe an iron-catalysed method for the direct H-3 labelling of pharmaceuticals by hydrogen isotope exchange, using tritium gas as the source of the radioisotope. The site selectivity of the iron catalyst is orthogonal to currently used iridium catalysts and allows isotopic labelling of complementary positions in drug molecules, providing a new diagnostic tool in drug development."], ["Crystal structure of oxygen-evolving photosystem II at a resolution of 1.9 \u00c5", "Photosystem II is the site of photosynthetic water oxidation and contains 20 subunits with a total molecular mass of 350 kDa. The structure of photosystem II has been reported at resolutions from 3.8 to 2.9 angstrom. These resolutions have provided much information on the arrangement of protein subunits and cofactors but are insufficient to reveal the detailed structure of the catalytic centre of water splitting. Here we report the crystal structure of photosystem II at a resolution of 1.9 angstrom. From our electron density map, we located all of the metal atoms of the Mn4CaO5 cluster, together with all of their ligands. We found that five oxygen atoms served as oxo bridges linking the five metal atoms, and that four water molecules were bound to the Mn4CaO5 cluster; some of them may therefore serve as substrates for dioxygen formation. We identified more than 1,300 water molecules in each photosystem II monomer. Some of them formed extensive hydrogen-bonding networks that may serve as channels for protons, water or oxygen molecules. The determination of the high-resolution structure of photosystem II will allow us to analyse and understand its functions in great detail."], ["Tunable polymer multi-shape memory effect", "Shape memory polymers are materials that can memorize temporary shapes and revert to their permanent shape upon exposure to an external stimulus such as heat(1), light(2,3), moisture(4) or magnetic field(5). Such properties have enabled a variety of applications including deployable space structures(6), biomedical devices(7,8), adaptive optical devices(9), smart dry adhesives(10) and fasteners(11). The ultimate potential for a shape memory polymer, however, is limited by the number of temporary shapes it can memorize in each shape memory cycle and the ability to tune the shape memory transition temperature(s) for the targeted applications. Currently known shape memory polymers are capable of memorizing one or two temporary shapes, corresponding to dual-and triple-shape memory effects (also counting the permanent shape), respectively(11-13). At the molecular level, the maximum number of temporary shapes a shape memory polymer can memorize correlates directly to the number of discrete reversible phase transitions (shape memory transitions) in the polymer(11-13). Intuitively, one might deduce that multi-shape memory effects are achievable simply by introducing additional reversible phase transitions. The task of synthesizing a polymer with more than two distinctive and strongly bonded(13) reversible phases, however, is extremely challenging. Tuning shape memory effects, on the other hand, is often achieved through tailoring the shape memory transition temperatures, which requires alteration in the material composition(14-16). Here I show that the perfluoro sulphonic acid ionomer (PFSA), which has only one broad reversible phase transition, exhibits dual-, triple-, and at least quadruple-shape memory effects, all highly tunable without any change to the material composition."]]
