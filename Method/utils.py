# MUTATION_CUSTOM_GUIDE: is added to the prompt to mutate to a novel combination (hypothesis) between research background and an inspiration
MUTATION_CUSTOM_GUIDE = "You should be careful on adopting ML methods as the novel content of the mutation, since currently we are using ML examples to illustrate the derivation of hypothesis from research background and inspirations, and now it seems that the ML concepts can therefore easily be abused. "
# HYPTHESIS_GENERATION_CUSTOM_GUIDE: is added to every prompt involving hypothesis generation
HYPTHESIS_GENERATION_CUSTOM_GUIDE = '''
Please formulate a detailed, valid, feasible, novel, and constructive hypothesis, primarily emphasizing the methodology and mechanistic design. Each step in your hypothesis should be clear, precise, and free from ambiguity. The expected performance or potential impact of the hypothesis is not the main focus and should be mentioned minimally.
The generated hypothesis must not exceed 600 words, but it can be shorter if conciseness doesn't sacrifice essential details (normally 600 words should be more than enough to describe the essential idea and essential details of a hypothesis). The hypothesis must remain concise yet comprehensive, clearly describing all essential chemical components, mechanistic steps, and key technical details, while avoiding unnecessary verbosity or redundant explanations of common scientific knowledge. If your initial hypothesis exceeds 600 words, try to compress it until it meets this constraint without omitting any critical information.

Usually a paper can be choosed as an inspiration is because it can potentially help to solve or alleviate one problem of a previous method for this research question so that leveraging the concepts related to the inspiration, a better method can be developed based on the previous methods and this inspiration. Take backpropagation as an example, the research question is how to use data to automatically improve the parameters of a multi-layer logistic regression with data, the inspiration is the chain rule in mathematics, and the research hypothesis is the backpropagation itself. Here the previous method can only inference the multi-layer logistic regression, but can't automatically update its parameters to learn from data. The selected chain rule inspiration can be leveraged to automatically update the parameters in the multi-layer logistic regression, and therefore improve over the previous method to create hypothesis. \nGiven a research question, the background and some of the existing methods for this research question, and several top-tier publications (including their title and abstract), try to identify which publication can potentially serve as an inspiration for the background research question so that combining the research question and the inspiration in some way, a novel, valid, and significant research hypothesis can be formed.

                    You are assisting {DISCIPLINE} scientists by providing detailed feedback on their newly proposed research hypothesis. The goal is to help them refine it for potential publication in a top {DISCIPLINE} venue such as Nature or Science.

                    As you know, to meet the standards of such venues, a strong research hypothesis should satisfy the following four criteria:

                    1. Specificity: The hypothesis should provide sufficient methodological detail so that other researchers can clearly understand what the proposed method is and how it will be carried out in practice, leaving no room for confusion or misinterpretation.

                    In particular, if the hypothesis involves introducing a new concept or component into an existing method, it should not stop at describing what the new concept is — it must also explain how the new concept will be concretely integrated, applied, or operationalized within the method.

                    Whenever possible, please also suggest specific parameters, conditions, or operational procedures (e.g., algorithm settings, material properties, experimental setups) that would enable researchers to directly test or implement the hypothesis in a laboratory or experimental environment.

                    2. Novelty: The hypothesis should propose a new idea, mechanism, or approach that has not been reported or established in existing literature.

                    Please carefully assess whether the core idea of the hypothesis — including its key concepts, methods, or combinations of techniques — has already been proposed or widely studied. If any part of the hypothesis appears similar to prior work, please point it out and explain why it may not be sufficiently novel.

                    Conversely, if the hypothesis is novel, please briefly explain what makes it distinct from existing approaches, such as introducing a new principle, a previously unexplored mechanism, or a new combination of known techniques in an original way.

                    3. Validity / Effectiveness: The hypothesis should be testable, verifiable, and practically feasible within real-world {DISCIPLINE} experimental settings.

                    Please evaluate whether the hypothesis can, in principle, be validated through {DISCIPLINE} experiments — assuming sufficient experimental resources. Consider whether the proposed method relies on reasonable assumptions, whether each step is technically executable, and whether the expected outcomes are measurable in a real-world setting.

                    Although we currently do not have access to lab experiments, please assess the validity based on your knowledge and understanding of {DISCIPLINE}, and highlight any potential challenges, limitations, or conditions that may affect the experimental verification of the hypothesis.

                    4. Significance: If possible, the hypothesis should have the potential for meaningful impact in the research community, such as advancing scientific understanding or opening new research directions. It is not necessary for the hypothesis to be groundbreaking, but it should ideally contribute to the field in a way that is recognized as significant by peers.

                    Please provide constructive feedback on whether the given hypothesis meets these four criteria. If any aspect is lacking, please explain why, and suggest concrete ways to improve it.

                    Important: Your feedback should focus on improving the methodological content of the hypothesis — that is, how to make the hypothesis itself more specific, novel, valid, and significant — rather than suggesting ways to improve the writing or description of these qualities.

                    You are a harsh and diligent reviewer in {DISCIPLINE}. You are well-known for carefully identifying flaws and usually giving low scores unless a hypothesis is truly exceptional.
                    Given a not-yet-peer-reviewed research hypothesis in {DISCIPLINE}, evaluate it from four aspects: Validness, Novelty, Significance, and Specificity.
                    Each aspect should be scored from 1 to 5 based on the strict guidelines below. High scores (4 or 5) should only be given to truly outstanding hypotheses. Most ordinary or vague hypotheses should receive scores of 1 to 3. Be strict, objective, and critical. Your evaluation should focus only on the content and methodology of the hypothesis, not on writing style.

                    Scoring Guidelines
                    Validness (Objective Soundness)
                    Does the hypothesis make sense based on your knowledge and reasoning ability?
                    5 — Exceptional soundness. Fully coherent and highly reasonable. No weak assumptions.
                    4 — Strong validity. Mostly reasonable with some uncertain assumptions.
                    3 — Barely valid. Possible but weak, speculative, or fragile reasoning.
                    2 — Low validity. Doubtful or inconsistent.
                    1 — Invalid. Contradicts known science or impossible mechanisms.

                    Novelty (Originality)
                    Is the core idea new?
                    5 — Groundbreaking novelty. Fundamentally new principle or mechanism.
                    4 — Highly novel. Significant deviation from existing knowledge.
                    3 — Moderate novelty. New combination but within existing frameworks.
                    2 — Low novelty. Minor variations of existing work.
                    1 — No novelty. Standard or trivial idea.

                    Significance (Research Impact)
                    If true, how much impact does it have?
                    5 — Field-changing. Reshapes core theories or applications.
                    4 — High impact. Advances state-of-the-art or solves key problem.
                    3 — Meaningful. Improves a subfield or opens new directions.
                    2 — Limited. Incremental improvement or niche value.
                    1 — Minimal. Very narrow or little added value.

                    Specificity (Clarity & Methodological Detail)
                    Is the hypothesis detailed and actionable for scientists?
                    5 — Fully detailed. Every key mechanism and parameter is specified.
                    4 — Detailed. Most steps are clear with minor clarification needed.
                    3 — Moderately clear. General methodology but vague key steps.
                    2 — Low specificity. High-level idea only; hard to use directly.
                    1 — Vague. No actionable detail.

Particularly, 5 points mean that the proposed hypothesis (1) covers all the key points and leverage them similarly as in the methodology of the groundtruth hypothesis, and (2) does not contain any extra key point that has apparent flaws; 4 points mean that the proposed hypothesis (1) covers all the key points (or at least three key points) and leverage them similarly as in the methodology of the groundtruth hypothesis, (2) but also with extra key points that have apparent flaws; 3 points mean that the proposed hypothesis (1) covers at least two key points and leverage them similarly as in the methodology of the groundtruth hypothesis, (2) but does not cover all key points in the groundtruth hypothesis, (3) might or might not contain extra key points; 2 points mean that the proposed hypothesis (1) covers at least one key point in the methodology of the groundtruth hypothesis, and leverage it similarly as in the methodology of groundtruth hypothesis, (2) but does not cover all key points in the groundtruth hypothesis, and (3) might or might not contain extra key points; 1 point means that the proposed hypothesis (1) covers at least one key point in the methodology of the groundtruth hypothesis, (2) but is used differently as in the methodology of groundtruth hypothesis, and (3) might or might not contain extra key points; 0 point means that the proposed hypothesis does not cover any key point in the methodology of the groundtruth hypothesis at all. Please note that the total number of key points in the groundtruth hypothesis might be less than three, so that multiple points can be given. E.g., there's only one key point in the groundtruth hypothesis, and the proposed hypothesis covers the one key point, it's possible to give 2 points, 4 points, and 5 points. In this case, we should choose score from 4 points and 5 points, depending on the existence and quality of extra key points. 'Leveraging a key point similarly as in the methodology of the groundtruth hypothesis' means that in the proposed hypothesis, the same (or very related) concept (key point) is used in a similar way with a similar goal compared to the groundtruth hypothesis (not necessarily for the proposed hypothesis to be exactly the same with the groudtruth hypothesis to be classified as 'similar'). When judging whether an extra key point has apparent flaws, you should use your own knowledge to judge, but rather than to rely on the count number of pieces of extra key point to judge. \nPlease evaluate the proposed hypothesis based on the groundtruth hypothesis. \nThe proposed hypothesis is: ", "\n\nThe groundtruth hypothesis is: ", "\n\nThe key points in the groundtruth hypothesis are: ", "\n\nPlease evaluate the proposed hypothesis based on the groundtruth hypothesis, and give a score.
