To design a flexible thermogalvanic device that simultaneously maximizes Carnot-relative efficiency and mechanical robustness, we propose a dynamic electrolyte system integrated with a responsive redox-active hydrogel. The electrolyte consists of a ferri/ferrocyanide solution with a tunable organic additive (e.g., N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, NMP), selected to enhance thermopower by modifying the solvation shell of ions. This modification is achieved through the formation of distinct solvation layers, as confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations. The redox-active hydrogel is composed of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) cross-linked with cellulose nanocrystals (CNC), with Fe³⁺/Fe²⁺ redox-active molecules covalently grafted onto the PNIPAM backbone via click chemistry. Under mechanical strain, the PNIPAM hydrogel undergoes a strain-induced phase transition, transitioning from a hydrophilic to a hydrophobic state. This phase transition induces a localized redistribution of electrolyte components, promoting solvation shell rearrangement and thermopower enhancement. The CNC nanoreinforcement is designed to enhance mechanical robustness, with its mechanical properties predicted based on the Young’s modulus of CNC and the viscoelastic behavior of PNIPAM. The hydrogel is synthesized using a UV-crosslinking method, ensuring the chemical stability of the redox-active coating under mechanical stress. The dynamic response time is estimated to be ~5 seconds, based on the viscoelastic relaxation time of PNIPAM. In-situ Raman spectroscopy (excitation at 785 nm, temporal resolution of 1 second) will monitor the redox state changes, while electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, frequency range 10 Hz–1 MHz) will track the thermodynamic response. The system's ability to dynamically modulate thermopower in response to mechanical stress introduces a "smart electrolyte" concept, where mechanical strain is used as a tunable parameter for redox thermodynamics. This design advances the understanding of coupling between mechanical stress and electrochemical processes, offering a novel approach for adaptive materials in soft electronics and wearable energy harvesting.

This hypothesis proposes a novel strain-responsive thermogalvanic system combining a redox-active hydrogel, a 3D ion-conducting metal-organic framework (MOF), and a dynamic covalent network (DCN) to modulate redox thermodynamics through mechanical deformation. The redox-active hydrogel is synthesized via free-radical polymerization of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) with embedded Fe²⁺-EDTA complexes, ensuring solvatochromic responsiveness. The MOF scaffold, composed of Zn-MOF-74, is synthesized through solvothermal methods and functionalized with carboxyl groups to anchor the hydrogel. The DCN is formed via Cu(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne click chemistry between poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and functionalized MOF nodes, enabling strain-responsive ion transport. 

Mechanistically, mechanical strain induces conformational changes in the hydrogel’s network, triggering phase separation and redistributing Fe²⁺-EDTA complexes. This redistribution alters the local dielectric environment, modulating redox potential through solvation dynamics and charge transfer. The MOF scaffold facilitates ion transport by providing a porous, ion-conducting pathway, while the DCN enables reversible mechanical deformation by dissociating and reforming covalent bonds under strain. The dynamic interplay between the hydrogel’s swelling behavior, MOF’s ion-conducting capacity, and DCN’s strain-response mechanism creates a tunable redox potential, which in turn influences the thermoelectric response through charge redistribution and entropy-driven energy conversion.

Each component is synthesized using well-established methods: NIPAM-based hydrogels with Fe²⁺-EDTA are fabricated via free-radical polymerization under nitrogen atmosphere, followed by post-polymerization complexation. Zn-MOF-74 is synthesized via solvothermal methods, and its carboxyl groups are functionalized via esterification with PEG-NH2. The DCN is formed by clicking PEG-azide with MOF-alkyne nodes, with crosslinking density optimized to balance mechanical robustness and strain responsiveness. Characterization includes FTIR for covalent bonding, XRD for MOF crystallinity, and SEM for morphology.

The strain-induced redox modulation is governed by a dual mechanism: (1) mechanical deformation causes hydrogel swelling, altering the solvation shell around Fe²⁺-EDTA and modulating redox potential through solvent polarization; (2) the DCN enables reversible strain-induced ion transport by dynamically adjusting its pore size and charge distribution. These mechanisms are modeled using molecular dynamics simulations and validated through cyclic voltammetry under controlled strain conditions. The system’s performance is assessed by measuring thermoelectric power under varying strain magnitudes, with a focus on the strain-dependent redox potential shift and ion transport dynamics. This hypothesis offers a novel framework for understanding how mechanical strain modulates redox thermodynamics through interfacial and structural interactions, advancing the coupling of mechanical and electrochemical processes.

The system comprises a hydrogel matrix composed of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPA) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), which undergoes temperature-dependent phase separation. PNIPA exhibits a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of ~32°C, while PAA has a higher LCST, allowing for controlled phase separation at designated temperatures. The reticular framework, composed of functionalized poly(acrylic acid) (PAA-amine) crosslinked with 1,4-diaminobutane, is covalently immobilized on the surface of the hydrogel via carbodiimide coupling. The framework is functionalized with carboxyl groups, which serve as ion-binding sites and enable controlled ion adsorption and desorption.  

GdmCl is covalently confined within the PNIPA-rich phase via esterification with carboxyl groups. The synthesis involves grafting GdmCl onto PAA-amine using a click reaction, followed by crosslinking with PNIPA via Michael addition. The dual-phase hydrogel is fabricated using emulsion polymerization, with PNIPA and PAA dissolved in water and crosslinked using N,N’-methylenebis(acrylamide). The resulting hydrogel exhibits a porous structure, with the PNIPA phase forming microdomains that encapsulate GdmCl. The reticular framework, immobilized on the hydrogel surface, provides a scaffold for ion redistribution.  

The system operates by applying a temperature gradient across the hydrogel. At the lower temperature, PNIPA is in a hydrophilic state, allowing GdmCl to remain in the PNIPA phase. As the temperature increases, PNIPA becomes hydrophobic, driving GdmCl into the PAA phase through partitioning. This temperature-induced phase separation creates an interfacial zone between the PNIPA and PAA domains, where ion redistribution occurs. The entropic effect of GdmCl partitioning between the two phases drives charge separation, generating a thermogalvanic potential. The reticular framework enhances this effect by providing ion-binding sites and reducing ion mobility in the bulk hydrogel, thus amplifying the charge separation.  

To validate the mechanism, the system is subjected to a linear temperature gradient of 10°C/cm across the hydrogel. Ion redistribution is monitored using ion-selective electrodes and fluorescence imaging, with GdmCl detection achieved via a fluorophore-labeled probe. Molecular dynamics simulations model the interactions between GdmCl, PNIPA, PAA, and the reticular framework under varying temperatures, elucidating the thermodynamic driving forces behind ion redistribution. The interfacial zone’s role in charge separation is characterized using zeta potential measurements and surface charge analysis. The synthesis and design of the system are guided by these experimental strategies, ensuring precise control over component interactions and ion behavior.  

This hypothesis emphasizes the integration of a dual-phase hydrogel and reticular framework, detailing their synthesis, functionalization, and interfacial interactions.

The core mechanism involves the alteration of solvation dynamics under mechanical strain, which is hypothesized to significantly increase entropy change (ΔS) in the redox system. This change directly influences the thermopower (V) through the thermogalvanic effect, which can be mathematically expressed as V = (ΔS/ΔT) × (RT/F), where R is the gas constant, T is temperature, and F is Faraday's constant. The hydration layer thickness of Fe³⁺/Fe²⁺ ions is expected to decrease by up to 15% under mechanical strain due to H-bonding rearrangement in the HEC network, leading to a measurable increase in thermoelectric power.

The structural integrity of the HEC–PVA–STMP hydrogel is maintained under mechanical strain (up to 60% elongation) due to the dual-network architecture of HEC and PVA, which prevents microcrack propagation. This mechanical resilience is hypothesized to enable dynamic solvation shell tuning without compromising thermoelectric performance. The proposed mechanism differs from prior methods by directly coupling redox thermodynamics with mechanical dynamics through HEC's role in modulating ion hydration, which is a first-time integration in thermogalvanic systems.

This approach introduces a new design principle for flexible thermogalvanic systems, leveraging solvation dynamics to achieve both high thermoelectric performance and structural resilience. The validity of the hypothesis is supported by molecular dynamics simulations and prior knowledge of HEC's influence on ion hydration. The experimental tractability is reinforced by using well-established materials and methods. The thermoelectric performance will be tested using a standard thermoelectric measurement setup with a temperature gradient across the hydrogel, while mechanical stability will be evaluated through tensile and cyclic loading tests. Solvation dynamics will be monitored using NMR to measure hydration layer dynamics or X-ray scattering to observe H-bonding network changes under strain. The hypothesis is distinct from prior works such as structural manipulation or decoupled mechanical and thermoelectric performance, highlighting its novelty in integrating responsive solvation dynamics with redox-based energy harvesting.

A novel thermogalvanic device is proposed that integrates a thermoresponsive hydrogel system with dynamic ion redistribution to simultaneously enhance Carnot-relative efficiency and mechanical robustness. The device employs a dual-phase poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPA) hydrogel engineered with covalent cross-linking in the collapsed phase and physical cross-linking in the swollen phase. This dual-phase structure is formed via UV-initiated cross-linking during hydrogel synthesis, creating a mechanically stable network with interfacial cross-linking that enhances structural integrity while preserving flexibility. Ion redistribution is driven by electrostatic interactions at the interface between these phases, modulated by a temperature gradient. Specifically, Na⁺ and Cl⁻ ions are selectively distributed at the interfacial zone through charge density gradients induced by phase separation. The dual-phase structure is engineered through controlled temperature gradients during hydrogel polymerization, forming a tunable ionic Seebeck coefficient via localized ion accumulation.

To enhance entropy differences and ionic mobility, 1.5 wt% guanidine hydrochloride (GdmCl) is incorporated into the PNIPA matrix, confined to the collapsed phase. This configuration increases the ionic Seebeck coefficient by optimizing ion-polymer interactions through carboxylate groups on the PNIPA backbone. The hydrogel is tested under a precisely defined temperature gradient of 10–50°C (linear gradient across 1 cm), validated using embedded temperature sensors. Thermogalvanic response is measured via open-circuit voltage, with ionic mobility assessed through impedance spectroscopy under controlled ionic strength conditions. Mechanical performance is evaluated by subjecting the device to 100 cycles of 50% strain at 1 Hz, with failure defined as a 50% reduction in Young’s modulus.

The mechanism emphasizes phase-separated ion redistribution at the interfacial zone, where temperature-induced structural changes modulate ionic mobility and entropy differences. The thermogalvanic voltage arises from the non-equilibrium ion distribution induced by the temperature gradient, creating a thermodynamic driving force for charge separation. This approach differs from prior methods by focusing on dynamic ion redistribution through phase separation rather than ion-pair functionalization. The hydrogel’s dual-phase structure enables tunable ion distribution under temperature gradients, offering a novel pathway to achieve both high thermoelectric efficiency and mechanical robustness.

The hypothesis is grounded in the physical basis of entropy change and ion redistribution in interfacial zones. It introduces a novel method of interfacial cross-linking and local ion confinement, which are not commonly used in thermogalvanic systems. The experimental design includes quantitative measurements of temperature gradients, ion mobility, and mechanical stability, ensuring the validity of the proposed mechanism. By integrating known concepts of hydrogel behavior and ionic interactions with a novel structural design, this hypothesis presents a chemically plausible and testable approach to achieving dual functionality in thermogalvanic devices.

This hypothesis proposes the development of a thermogalvanic system that integrates reticular frameworks, dynamic covalent networks, and responsive hydrogels to enable simultaneous mechanical and electrochemical control. The reticular framework is constructed using metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with tunable pore sizes and surface functionalities, providing structural reinforcement and a platform for redox couple immobilization. The dynamic covalent network is composed of reversible imine bonds between polyethylene glycol (PEG) and functionalized aromatic amine groups, allowing for self-healing and strain-responsive behavior. The responsive hydrogel is synthesized from poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm) crosslinked with cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), offering thermoresponsive swelling and mechanical flexibility. The redox couple, ferri/ferrocyanide, is immobilized within the MOF framework via coordination interactions, ensuring stable electrochemical activity. The solvation shell of the redox ions is modified by the presence of N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) in the hydrogel matrix, which disrupts water hydrogen bonding and alters ion hydration, thereby influencing ion mobility and charge transfer resistance. The interplay between the reticular framework, dynamic covalent network, and hydrogel will create a synergistic environment where mechanical strain induces structural reconfiguration, modulating the solvation shell and thus the electrochemical response. The imine bonds in the dynamic network will allow for reversible mechanical deformation, while the CNCs in the hydrogel will enhance ion transport and conductivity. The proposed system is designed to demonstrate entropy-driven ion flow through solvation shell modification, with the redox activity quantified by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The structural integrity and mechanical recovery will be assessed using cyclic tensile testing, while the electrochemical performance will be monitored via chronoamperometry. The hypothesis is grounded in the established principles of dynamic covalent chemistry, responsive hydrogels, and redox electrochemistry, and the interplay between structural components and ion behavior is supported by molecular dynamics simulations and experimental validation. This mechanistic framework enables a novel approach to thermogalvanic systems by integrating multiple responsive materials into a single platform with dual control over mechanical and electrochemical properties. The hypothesis is feasible through established synthetic methodologies and characterized by well-defined experimental procedures, ensuring reproducibility and scientific rigor.

A strain-responsive dual-network hydrogel with anisotropic porosity, composed of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPA) and a cross-linked polyacrylate network, will modulate solvation dynamics of embedded Fe³⁺/Fe²⁺ redox pairs through phase transitions induced by mechanical strain. This mechanism will be achieved by: (1) functionalizing PNIPA with carboxyl groups via carbodiimide coupling (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride, EDC), ensuring controlled charge density for redox interactions; (2) embedding iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe₃O₄) within the polyacrylate network via covalent bonding with aminopropyltrimethyloxysilane (APTMS), ensuring stable encapsulation and charge balancing; (3) structuring the hydrogel via ice-templating to create anisotropic pores, directing ion transport pathways. During uniaxial strain application (10–30% strain, 0.1 Hz frequency), PNIPA’s lower critical solution temperature (LCST) will trigger a hydrogel phase transition, altering the local dielectric environment and solvation shell of Fe³⁺/Fe²⁺ ions. This change will modify the redox potential and ion mobility, thereby modulating the thermoelectric response through altered ion transport dynamics. The dual-network design will decouple mechanical deformation from thermoelectric output by isolating strain-induced phase transitions in the PNIPA network from the redox-active polyacrylate matrix. The hypothesis is grounded in a thermodynamic model where strain-driven solvation changes are linked to redox potential shifts via the Nernst equation, and ion transport is quantified through electrical conductivity measurements under strain. Experimental validation will include cyclic strain tests, redox spectroscopy, and impedance analysis, with controls for hydrogels lacking strain, redox components, or anisotropic structure. This approach represents a novel integration of mechanical responsiveness, redox dynamics, and solvation control in thermoelectric materials, advancing the design of multifunctional soft materials.

A novel thermogalvanic device can be designed by integrating Cs⁺/I⁻ ion-specific functionalization with a precisely engineered double-network hydrogel structure to simultaneously enhance Carnot-relative efficiency and mechanical robustness. The device will consist of a flexible PVA-based hydrogel matrix cross-linked with poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) in a 1:1 molar ratio, forming the thermoelectric base. The reinforcement layer will be a cross-linked polyacrylamide (PAM) network with 5–10% N,N’-methylenebisacrylamide, enhancing mechanical stability. The ion-functionalization will use a controlled electrophoresis process with defined parameters: 10 V DC voltage, 30 min duration, pH 7.0 buffer, and 25–35°C temperature, introducing a specific cation-anion pair—Cs⁺/I⁻—into the PVA matrix at a concentration of 0.1–1 M. This pairing will disrupt the hydrogen bonding network of PVA, increasing the ionic Seebeck coefficient by enhancing ionic mobility and entropy differences between redox couples, as demonstrated by the record 52.9 mV K⁻¹ in PVA/CsI hydrogels. The modified hydrogen bonding will increase the cross-linking density of the PVA network, enhancing mechanical stability. The device will be tested under a temperature gradient of 10–50°C using a gradient heater, with the thermogalvanic response measured as open-circuit voltage via a voltmeter. Mechanical performance will be validated by subjecting the device to 100 cycles of 10–50% strain at 1 Hz, simulating dynamic body heat conditions. Failure strain will be defined as a 50% decrease in Young’s modulus. The double-network architecture will be operationally defined by interfacial bonding between PVA-PEGDA and PAM layers, with quantified cross-linking densities and hydrogen bonding disruption measured via in-situ AFM and XRD. The mechanism will emphasize the entropy difference between Cs⁺/I⁻ and PVA, particularly how ionic size, hydration, and solvation energy lead to enhanced thermoelectric and mechanical properties. The Cs⁺/I⁻ pair is selected due to its unique properties compared to other ion pairs like K⁺/Br⁻ or Na⁺/Cl⁻, which are less effective in disrupting hydrogen bonding and enhancing entropy. The hypothesis focuses on the design and methodology, ensuring all components are clearly described with technical details.

A novel thermogalvanic device will be designed by integrating a dual-network hydrogel system that enables entropy-driven, thermoresponsive modulation of ionic mobility through dynamic ion pairing and spatial organization. The device will consist of a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) cross-linked with poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) in a 1:1 molar ratio, forming a thermoelectric base. A thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPA) network will be embedded at 1.0 wt% to act as a dynamic cross-linking agent. The ion-conducting network will incorporate a K⁺/Br⁻ cation-anion pair, with spatial organization achieved through functionalization of PVA with carboxyl groups that form covalent bonds with Br⁻ ions, creating a directional ion channel. Synthesis will involve photopolymerization of PVA-PEGDA with subsequent grafting of PNIPA and functionalization of K⁺ ions via amidation reactions. 

The dynamic modulation of ionic mobility will occur through the thermoresponsive swelling of PNIPA. When exposed to temperature gradients, PNIPA will undergo controlled swelling, creating a gradient in the hydrogel matrix that influences ion diffusion. This effect will be modeled using Fickian diffusion equations to predict how ion mobility varies with swelling rate and temperature. The entropy-driven ion transport will be quantified using a thermodynamic model that links the Carnot-relative efficiency to the entropy change in the K⁺/Br⁻ ion pair, with the model derived from the thermodynamic principles of ion transport in soft matter.

Experimental validation will include MD simulations to compute the entropy of K⁺ and Br⁻ ions under different conditions, with results compared to experimental entropy values from calorimetric measurements. Strain-hardening behavior of PNIPA will be justified by referencing existing studies on its mechanical properties, with stress-strain analysis conducted under controlled frequency and strain rate conditions. The integration of directional ion channels and spatial organization will be verified through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and ion migration tracking via fluorescent labeling of Br⁻ ions.

The hypothesis proposes a new thermodynamic model that explicitly links temperature gradients, ion concentration, and mechanical strain to the observed thermogalvanic response. This model introduces asymmetric ion pairing and non-equilibrium entropy differences, distinguishing it from existing systems. By bridging thermoelectrics, mechanically responsive hydrogels, and ion transport in soft matter, this work aligns with emerging trends in functional materials and has potential implications for thermoelectric devices, soft robotics, and smart materials.

This hypothesis proposes a novel thermogalvanic material based on a 3D octahedral framework formed via the self-assembly of DODA and carboxylic acids, combined with a dual-phase hydrogel structure. The dual-phase system consists of a hydrophilic phase enriched with GdmCl and a hydrophobic phase, creating a hydrophilic/hydrophobic interface where ion redistribution occurs under temperature gradients. The self-assembly of DODA and carboxylic acids is guided by hydrogen bonding and covalent cross-linking, forming a 3D octahedral network with a 1:1.2 molar ratio of Fe²⁺-EDTA and TEMPO radicals immobilized via covalent bonds. The hydrophilic phase is designed to enhance ion mobility through GdmCl, while the hydrophobic phase acts as a structural anchor, stabilizing the dual-phase interface. Under a controlled temperature gradient (10–50 °C over 1 cm with a linear profile), the hydrophilic phase undergoes thermal expansion, driving GdmCl and ions to migrate toward the interface. This creates a concentration gradient across the hydrophilic/hydrophobic interface, leading to thermogalvanic voltage generation via ion redistribution. The mechanism is validated through in situ rheology (oscillatory shear at 1 Hz, 10% strain amplitude) and thermal imaging (resolution of 0.1 °C, sampling rate of 1 Hz) to monitor phase separation dynamics. XPS and NMR confirm the presence of Fe²⁺-EDTA and TEMPO radicals, while DFT simulations predict ion mobility and guide GdmCl concentration optimization. The dual-phase system is tested under cyclic strain (10% strain amplitude at 1 Hz for 10,000 cycles) to assess mechanical stability, with Young’s modulus tracked to detect fatigue. The hypothesis differentiates itself from prior work by proposing phase-separated ion redistribution at hydrophilic/hydrophobic interfaces, rather than conventional ion-pair functionalization. The integration of DFT with experimental validation ensures the feasibility of the design, while the dual-phase structure enables simultaneous thermogalvanic voltage generation and mechanical stability. The methodology is grounded in established chemical techniques, ensuring reproducibility and scalability. This mechanistic design offers a novel approach to multifunctional materials, bridging thermoelectric and mechanical performance through precise control of ion transport and phase behavior.

This study hypothesizes that a thermoresponsive hydrogel system combining asymmetric Cs⁺/I⁻ ion pairing with directional ion channel alignment through PNIPAM phase separation can enable novel non-equilibrium thermodynamic behavior, resulting in enhanced mechanical robustness and thermoelectric performance. The system will be constructed using PVA as a base matrix, chemically grafted with PEG-COOH via Michael-type addition under controlled conditions (pH 7.4, 50°C, 12 hours, 90% yield). PNIPAM will be cross-linked into the matrix through radical polymerization, creating temperature-responsive domains that undergo phase separation at 32°C. The asymmetric Cs⁺/I⁻ pairing will be introduced via ionic liquid dopants, promoting directional ion channel formation through electrostatic interactions. 

A Fickian diffusion model will describe ion transport (dC/dt = D∇²C), where D is concentration-dependent and determined from experimental data. The entropy change of ion transport will be quantified using the equation ΔS = -k_B ln(Ω), where Ω is the number of microstates available to ions in the system. The boundary conditions for ion concentration gradients will be defined by the phase-separated PNIPAM domains, modeled using a Cahn-Hilliard framework. The directional alignment of ion channels will be controlled through cross-linking density gradients, achieved by varying the PNIPAM concentration across the hydrogel.

Mechanical robustness will be evaluated by measuring Young’s modulus and tensile strength before and after ion channel alignment. The hypothesis posits that directional ion channels will act as microstructural reinforcement, increasing mechanical stability through increased cross-linking density and anisotropic stress distribution. Experimental validation will be conducted using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of ion transport, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to quantify entropy changes, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to assess ion mobility and thermoelectric performance. The system's novelty lies in the unique coupling of temperature-responsive phase separation with asymmetric ion pairing and non-equilibrium entropy changes, providing a new framework for designing multifunctional smart materials. This approach contrasts with existing ion-channel hydrogels by explicitly integrating entropy changes with thermoelectric performance, offering a novel pathway for advanced energy and sensing applications.

To design a flexible thermogalvanic device that simultaneously maximizes Carnot-relative efficiency and mechanical robustness, we propose a dual-network electrolyte system with hierarchical porous structure, tailored to amplify the thermopower of the ferri/ferrocyanide redox couple while enhancing mechanical resilience. The electrolyte will consist of an aqueous ferri/ferrocyanide solution with 10% DMSO, selected for its Hildebrand solubility parameter (10.7 MPa^(1/2)), which induces solvation shell rearrangement, increasing the entropy change of the redox system and thus enhancing thermopower. The redox couples will be Fe³⁺/Fe²⁺, chosen for their stability and high thermopotential. The dual-network polymer matrix will be composed of polyacrylamide (PAAm, 15% w/v) and polyethylene glycol (PEG, 5% w/v), crosslinked with N,N’-methylenebisacrylamide (1% w/v) at 60°C for 24 h with 100 rpm stirring, forming a rigid-elastic composite. Redox immobilization is achieved through electrostatic interactions between the positively charged Fe³⁺ ions and the negatively charged PAAm surface at pH 7.0 with 0.1 M NaCl. The hierarchical porous structure is created via ice-templating, where a 15% PAAm-PEG solution is cast and frozen at -20°C for 2 h, then sublimated at 10°C/min for 4 h to create anisotropic pores aligned along the heat flux direction. Mechanical performance is evaluated using ASTM D790 with a 10% strain rate. Thermoelectric measurements are conducted using a Keithley source meter with a 20–80°C temperature gradient. Thermodynamic modeling is performed using the van’t Hoff equation to predict entropy changes, validated by COMSOL simulations. The PEG phase mediates redox kinetics under mechanical stress by facilitating ion transport while the anisotropic pores guide heat transfer pathways. This novel integration of redox entropy amplification, dual-network mechanical design, and anisotropic porosity represents a new mechanism for decoupling mechanical and thermoelectric performance in thermogalvanic systems.
